A [[permanent note]] is a singular thought and a topic note is a singular idea. A permanent note should be able to be linked several places as it's thought is small enough to be free of context. A topic note is a much broader concept that is made up of many smaller thoughts. It is a collects and abstracts those thoughts both for access and for organization. It power is in it's generalness (how easily it can be found where it was not directly linked)
