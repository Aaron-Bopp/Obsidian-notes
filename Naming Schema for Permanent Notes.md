The only constraint on the way permanent notes are titled is uniqueness. If you are creating a new note and run into a naming conflict it can mean one of a few things.
1. The old note's title is too broad and should be changed
2. the new note's title is too broad and should be changed
3. Both note's titles are too broad and they should be related by a [[topic note]]. 
4. Both note's title are accurate and they should be combined/edited together
