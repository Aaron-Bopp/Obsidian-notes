# Samskara's
- #Def [Samskara](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)>) -> In Indian philosophy and Indian religions, samskaras or sanskaras are mental impressions, recollections, or psychological imprints. 
	- In Hindu philosophies, samskaras are a basis for the development of karma theory.
	- > According to various schools of Indian philosophy, every action, intent or preparation by an individual leaves a _samskara_ (impression, impact, imprint) in the deeper structure of the person's mind. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)#cite_note-ian-2) These impressions then await volitional fruition in that individual's future, in the form of hidden expectations, circumstances or a subconscious sense of self-worth. These _Samskaras_ manifest as tendencies, karmic impulses, subliminal impressions, habitual potencies or innate dispositions.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)#cite_note-ian-2)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)#cite_note-Jeaneane_Fowler_2002-3) In ancient Indian texts, the theory of _Samskara_ explains how and why human beings remember things, and the effect that memories have on people's suffering, happiness and contentment.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)#cite_note-ian-2)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)#cite_note-stephen2-4)
