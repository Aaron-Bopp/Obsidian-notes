
 - [[Teroth]]   is the demon king of [[Tharoline]]  . Legend has it that he was once an elven god of war, who had his body ripped apart by [[Crenos]]   as punishment for seducing his lover and cast into the furthest pits of a plane known as [[Jacaris]]   which is said to be home to rivers of fire, forests made of glass, and unimaginable monsters. Through sheer strength of will, [[Teroth]]   stitched his body back together and unleashed the inhabitants of [[Jacaris]]  , the orcs and goblins, onto [[Tharoline]]   to wreak havoc on the land as a form of revenge on [[Ceros]]  .
	 -     Today [[Teroth]]   is worshiped by Orcs and Goblins in [[Tharoline]]   as they view him as their creator. As such his worship is primarily contained to [[Badlands]]  , though he does have a small group of worshipers in [[Ezemor]]   and [[Meijing]]  . These worshipers are often the members of secret cults, meeting in the dead of night to practice dark rituals and plan the second coming of the monster armies to [[Tharoline]]  .
