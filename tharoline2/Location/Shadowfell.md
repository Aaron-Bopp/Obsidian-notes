	 - You remember everything. You came from a world very different to [[Tharoline]]  . It was a world where everyone from great kings to the lowest of peasants possessed some degree of magic. Those with stronger powers ruled over those who didn’t. Eventually war broke out though, the world began tearing itself apart. Your parents, poor scholars, made a decision. They had unlocked the key to traveling between planes, and they were going to use that power to take you to a world where the three of you could live safely. Something went wrong though, and you ended up stranded deep in the [[Shadowfell]] , where they found that their magic no longer worked. You traveled through, eventually losing track of the days, as you searched desperately for a way out. They thought they were onto something when a strange creature known only as “The Beast'' took you. No matter how hard you think, you cannot remember what it did to you, or how long you were with, but when you awoke on the streets of [[Blackvale]] , you had a new found power.

	 - [[Shadowfell]] is a realm where different material planes connect.

	 - A powerful being lives there and most people who go there dont return. No one knows why. The beast lures people into the Shadowfell. End up there by miscalculations or bridges to the Shadowfell.

	 - crossing into the shadowfell is fairly easy, but you cant get back magically and are stuck in shadowfell until a lunar eclipse.

	 - A year here is 5 years there. lunar eclipse annual (mid spring)
