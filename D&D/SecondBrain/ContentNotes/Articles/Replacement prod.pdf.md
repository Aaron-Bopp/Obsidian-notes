- > "Why is it dif-ficult for some people to embrace multiculturalism? One key factor is threat." 
- > "Another possible reason relates to belonging. Diversity tends to be associated with non-White groups (Unzueta & Binning, 2010), and Whites can feel excluded by multiculturalism (Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011)." 
- > "Some research suggests that support for multicultural ideology relates to less stereotyping (Hachfeld et al., 2015; Velasco González et al., 2008), whereas other research points to greater stereotyping (Wolsko, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000). However, in the latter case, stereotyping does not necessarily link to lower regard for ethnic minorities among Whites or ability to use indi-viduating information. With regard to prejudice, Whites and people of color who endorse multiculturalism show lower prejudice (Ryan et al., 2007; Wolsko et al., 2006)" 
    - It seems multiculturalism has complex effects on society
- > "Exposure to a multicultural passage temporarily reduces implicit prejudice (Lai et al., 2014) and results in less implicit and explicit prejudice than color blindness" 
- > "Multiculturalism can also have positive implications for interracial interaction, engagement, performance, and detection of discrimination" 
- > "exposure to a multicultural university statement (stressing strength in and embracing diversity) yielded better performance for women of color than a color-blind statement (stressing similarity and that social iden-tities are immaterial; Wilton et al., 2015)." 
- > "Whites exposed to multiculturalism displayed more hos-tility in an interracial interaction after being threatened" 
- > "Highlighting an organization’s diversity initiatives can also undermine detection of discrimination. Their pres-ence can create a deceptive impression of organiza-tional fairness, such that high-status group members are less likely to identify discriminatory behavior against low-status group members (Kaiser et al., 2013)." 
- > "Color blindness, while often heralded as a remedy for racism, can foster negative outcomes for people of color (e.g., interper-sonal discrimination). Moreover, color blindness serves to reify the social order, as it allows Whites to see them-selves as nonprejudiced, can be used to defend current racial hierarchies, and diminishes sensitivity to racism." 
- > "Multiculturalism can provoke threat and prejudice in Whites, but multicultural practices can positively affect outcomes and participation of people of color in differ-ent institutional arenas. Yet it also has the potential to caricature and demotivate them and mask discrimina-tion."
