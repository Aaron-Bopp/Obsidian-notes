> Wizards who master the art of [[Dunamancy]] have infinite worlds and possibilities at their fingertips

The sprawling lands and endless challenges of [[Exandria]] forge heroes and villains of many different stripes. [[The Myriad]] dangers of this wild continent constantly encroach upon innocents in need of protection, even as the legends and the magic of the past challenge those brave enough to reshape the world—for good or ill. The material in this chapter offers a number of new options for player characters to define who they are and what they wish to become.

The character options in this book are useful for players and Dungeon Masters alike, allowing adventurers and NPCs to take starring and supporting roles in your [[Wildemount]] D&D campaign. In this chapter, you’ll find stories and statistics that tie the races of the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") and the broader world of D&D to the lands of [[Wildemount]], as well as new subclasses, new [[backgrounds]], and new spells focused on an esoteric study of magic known as [[Dunamancy]].

The races, classes, and magic presented in this chapter might have different origins or defy the expectations established in other D&D books. The information in this chapter is specific to [[Wildemount]], and in some cases, to the wider world of [[Exandria]]. If something in this book differs from what’s presented in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook"), this material takes precedence in a [[Wildemount]] campaign.

The nations of [[Wildemount]] are populated by people of many different races. All the races present in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook"), as well as many of the other races of the D&D game, have a home in [[Wildemount]]. However, some of those races have cultures that differ from those of their kin elsewhere in the multiverse. This chapter provides cultural information about the common races of [[Wildemount]], plus several subraces not found in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook").

This section also includes information on what a typical character from each of the major regions of [[Wildemount]]—the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the [[Menagerie Coast]], and [[Xhorhas]]—might think of the members of each race. Although some of these accounts are accurate, others represent skewed perceptions or stereotypes. Many such perceptions have some basis in truth, but that truth has often been distorted by hearsay, prejudice, propaganda, or cultural misunderstandings.

## Dunamatic Subclasses
#### [[Chronurgist]]
#### [[Graviturgist]]

### [[Dunamis]] as a Martial Focus

Life is an extended series of choices. Every crossroads offers paths to different possibilities. The reality of each possible choice begins to coalesce as you approach the moment of decision, with multiple timelines humming with opportunity. Once a choice is made, one path sparks to life and continues while others fade, their energy of potentiality diffusing into the multiverse. A rare few characters learn to invoke and harness this released [[dunamis]] in the throes of battle to enhance their martial capabilities—and such warriors are uniformly feared.
