Stretching across the lands of [[Eastern Wynandir]] is a valley that still bears the lingering scars of the final battles of [[the Calamity]]. Fields of broken earth and muddy paths weave around muggy swamps and corrupted forests, home to creatures twisted by the echoing shadows of the Betrayer Gods who once ruled this region. Fierce storms rule the sky as hungry predators stalk the open, desolate plains.

All manner of beastfolk, [[goblinkin]], and nomadic outlanders claim the marshes and badlands of this region, honing their survival skills and warring ways against the elements and each other. Meanwhile, the [[dark elves]] of [[Rosohna]] have emerged as the core of civilization in [[Xhorhas]], reaching out to the wayward tribes and offering them enlightenment if they join the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

The [[dark elves]] of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] worship [[the Luxon]], a mysterious deity of light, after rejecting the evil designs of [[Lolth]] long ago. Nevertheless, the Spider Queen's venomous will still seeps into the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], as she and her devotees plot revenge.

Map 3.8: Wastes of Xorhas

### Asarius, the City of Beasts

**Population:** 48,025 (41% goblinoids, 32% [[gnolls]], 10% [[dark elves]], 17% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Den Olios]] governs the city, the laws of which are enforced and monitored by captains of the [[Aurora Watch]].

**Defense:** An impressive army is stationed on the outskirts of the city, comprised of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers and trained local warriors, as well as mercenaries.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies and equipment are available, as well as quality arms and some rare goods. Inns and taverns offer austere accommodations.

**Organizations:** There are several temples to [[the Luxon]], as well as some shrines to other deities. Merchant unions are beholden to the will of [[Den Olios]]. Meanwhile, [[Lolth]]'s [[Children of Malice]] lurk in the shadows.

Encircling and covering a massive, cracked hillside in the center of northern [[Xhorhas]], [[Asarius]] has grown into a cluttered sprawl of roughshod homesteads, mud huts, and military fortifications that are home to a bustling blend of the many peoples of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. The city is a cultural hub established by the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] for the wilder folk of the surrounding wastes and nomadic peoples who joined the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] convinced these [[wastefolk]] to unite under their banner by promising them protection, resources, and, in many cases, enlightenment (followed by conversion to the faith of [[the Luxon]]).

Although the establishment of [[Asarius]] was initially fraught, the city quickly grew into a symbol of unity for the scattered cultures of northern [[Xhorhas]], who eschewed the dangerous, competitive fight for survival to instead focus on building a community. In the generations since, the city has blossomed into a tangled web of quirky neighborhoods, filled with industry and musky scents. The muddy plains outside are tilled for hearty roots and produce, monstrous livestock are herded and kept in large pens and pits, and a growing force of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers train and prepare to battle the forces of the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

[[Asarius|Asarius, the City of Beasts]]

The wastes have always bred strong peoples who could survive despite the harsh environment, deadly wildlife, and scarce resources. Many of the [[wastefolk]] fought each other over hunting grounds and territory until the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] rebuffed attempts at violence and instead offered to bring together the tribes for the common goal of mutually assured survival. Some were intrigued by the opportunity, while others did not fully trust the strange [[elves]] who chose to wield words instead of swords. The early establishment of [[Asarius]] was marked by conflict, and while the community has since flourished, there are still many who live beneath the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s protection but mistrust the [[dark elves]]' intentions.

While many see the establishment of [[Asarius]] as pure altruism on the part of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], one cannot deny the importance of the city's central location among the wastes and strategic proximity to the border of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The Bright Queen has transformed the tiny township into a gargantuan military hub for the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], enlisting many thousands of [[wastefolk]] to form the backbone of its standing army. Wide swaths of military tents cover the western outskirts of the city as countless soldiers prepare for the coming conflicts in the west, training atop the terrifying war beasts and towering war machines brought from [[Rosohna]] or built alongside the towering walls of [[Asarius]].

The rule of law is tenuously imposed throughout the chaotic city, where the squabbles of argumentative civilians often lead to physical conflict. The laws of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], which stem from the faith of [[the Luxon]], are enforced by a network of trusted [[Aurora Watch]] captains and soldiers who report to [[Den Olios]] within the Aurora Hold. Local affairs are the jurisdiction of Lady Zethriss Olios, who works with representatives of each major neighborhood to manage the city and its people.

Blood often runs hot in [[Asarius]], and folk here often come to blows, simply to deal with the stress and frustration of life on the plains. The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] know this; as such, their laws regarding physical assaults and fights are far laxer in this city than anywhere else in [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] territory. Even so, disagreements can escalate to a point where theft, brutality, and murder sometimes occur with worrying regularity.

The majority of this rough, boisterous city is draped across a wide, muddy hill that overlooks the surrounding plains. The hill is surrounded by fifteen-foot-tall walls of purple vermaloc wood, harvested from the eponymous [[Vermaloc Wildwood]]. The interior of the city is a tangled mass of wayward, mud-slick streets and a hodgepodge of homes and structures that architecturally mirror the social mixture of [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] society and the many nomadic lifestyles of the [[wastefolk]]. The center of the city is marked by the ominous spire known as the Aurora Hold, home to [[Den Olios]].

The southeast region of [[Asarius]] is called the Pits, named for the multitude of breeding pits for war beasts and other beasts of burden. The Pits are responsible for the city's ever-present smell of wet animals and dung, and the area is also home to many poorer citizens seeking work wherever it can be found. The southwest portion of the city is known as the Creets, a rustic tangle of goblinoid neighborhoods and houses of farming folk who till the harsh environment beyond the eastern walls. The entire northern side of the city is simply known as the Northroads. Within this area, the Scowl Square is the center of commerce, and the North Center forms the industrial core of [[Asarius]]. An average of four thousand [[Aurora Watch]] are stationed outside the western walls of the city, with additional reinforcements during times of looming conflict.

Characters might come to the City of Beasts to find a reliable war beast, receive military training, or spy on the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] military preparations.

_**War Beast Escape (Mid Level).**_ While the characters stay in [[Asarius]], [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy) from the [[Dwendalian Empire]] infiltrate the city and simultaneously release war beasts from their pens after enraging them with whips and hot irons. As the characters try to stop the rampage, they learn that the spies are using the confusion to steal the city's secrets.

_**Echo of the Past (Mid Level).**_ A chaotic good, male, [[dranassar]] survivor named Jibu-Corryn has been living as a [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] in [[Asarius]] under the name of Alyxikon, a minor government secretary. A [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] of [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin) and [bugbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bugbear) who call themselves the Lords of Strife are hunting Jibu after hearing a rumor that one of the last of the [[dranassar]] are hiding in [[Asarius]]. Their leader, a [[hobgoblin]] captain named Gorthux, possesses the power to transform into a [bone devil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bone-devil) once per day, and plans to offer Jibu as a sacrifice to [[Bane]].

Jibu has heard tales of the characters' prowess and contacts them with a cryptic note. He begs for protection while he settles his affairs in [[Asarius]] and travels to a hermitage in [[Blightshore]].

### Barbed Fields

The valley north of [[Rosohna]] is covered by this broken and marred landscape of jagged rock, sunken craters, and scabrous, hooked spires of glass and rock jutting from the ground. It is said that the final battles of [[the Calamity]] were fought on this valley floor. The earth is so scarred here that few question the veracity of this legend. Treacherously unpredictable earth crumbles into sinkholes surrounded by thick, caustic tar pits that swallow careless wanderers, while the storms common to the region bring rain-slicked mud traps and flash floods.

However, powerful relics and armaments have been recovered from these ancient battlefields, so the strong and the stupid occasionally venture into the dangerous fields, often finding themselves hunted by the monsters that lurk in this ruined domain. It is rumored that toward the center of the barren fields grows a beautiful, towering tree that grew from the final seed left by [[Melora]] before she vanished to her realm beyond the [[Divine Gate]]. Powerful followers of the Wild Mother sometimes make a pilgrimage to this tree for guidance and communion, but the fields are so fraught with evil that few ever return.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-22.png)

[[Barbed Fields]]

The deeply wounded lands of the [[Barbed Fields]] are rife with planar entities bleeding through where the veils between worlds are thin.

_**Dark Days (Epic Level).**_ The extremely rare double eclipse, when the moons Catha and Ruidis overlap before the sun, is approaching, and it will occur over [[Xhorhas]]. Seers and oracles warn of portents that speak of an uncontrollable planar crossover, where multiple planes might briefly collide. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to bolster their ranks in preparation—but no one is prepared for the army from the Nine Hells that invades the fields when the realms merge. Leading this evil army is a [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pit-fiend) named Vanatoth.

### Bazzoxan

**Population:** 2,610 (81% [[dark elves]], 8% goblinoids, 11% other [[races]])

**Government:** Martial law is enforced by Taskhand [[Verin Thelyss]] and maintained by the local military.

**Defense:** The [[Aurora Watch]] defends the town and keeps the demonic incursions at bay. The few citizens learn combat skills out of necessity.

**Commerce:** Very basic supplies are available, if scarce, due to the dangerous circumstances surrounding the town. Most trade involves provisions and goods for survival and defense.

**Organizations:** There are a number of partially destroyed temples and a handful of small ones that are still intact.

[[Bazzoxan]] was once a dark temple instrumental in the machinations of the Betrayer Gods during [[the Calamity]], but the remaining ruin was left to gather dust like many relics of those terrible times. After [[Ghor Dranas]] was claimed by the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], settlers roamed north through the [[Barbed Fields]] to discover this site with hopes of renovating it as well. A community began to flourish within the ruins of [[Bazzoxan]] over a few generations, building the foundations of a new city around the looming stone structures of the abandoned sanctum—until demonic forces from within the old temple threw the burgeoning society into chaos. [[Bazzoxan]] is now perpetually locked in a stalemate between the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s forces and the abyssal incursion from within the temple. This unholy site is the subject of constant research and of growing worry for the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]].

About forty years ago, a group of curious local dungeoneers uncovered a long-dormant gateway to the Abyss. Its demonic influence drove them mad, and they accidentally reactivated the gateway of [[Bazzoxan]]—an immense rift between the Abyss and [[Exandria]]. This enabled demonic forces to pour out into the ruins and surrounding city. The incursion was eventually stifled, though at a great loss of life. The civilians that remain in [[Bazzoxan]] support the warriors who keep the forces of the Abyss at bay, as well as the arcanists who work to reseal the rift and reclaim the city.

The town is under martial law, with [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers keeping the peace under the current governance of Taskhand [[Verin Thelyss]]. The taskhand's lieutenants serve as minor officials and bureaucrats, and even the civilians who continue to stay are trained to defend themselves and fall into rank if malevolent forces rise from beneath their home.

With the tension of living in constant fear of demonic threat, the focus on survival in [[Bazzoxan]] leaves little room to break the law for personal gain. Even so, the rare grifter sometimes profits from gouging the price of provisions or swindling the fearful. Criminals who are caught by the Watch are sent south to [[Rosohna]] for punishment or simply executed, depending on the severity of their crimes.

The towering ruined temple sits against the rocky southern base of the [[Penumbra Range]], carved directly from the natural stone of the mountains. The ominous onyx doors that lead into the heart of the temple remain barred and under constant watch. Surrounding the temple are over a hundred abodes and structures, as well as a partially reconstructed town square. Construction equipment lies abandoned in the streets, and vacant homes sit untouched since their denizens were slain or forced to flee. Makeshift [[Aurora Watch]] barracks are continuously expanded to make room for the reinforcements sent to push back the fiends that assail the city from beneath.

Adventurers loyal to the [[Kryn Dynasty]] are welcome in [[Bazzoxan]] and will almost certainly be asked to aid with keeping Abyssal forces at bay or gathering spell components for the mages trying to seal the rift.

_**Heir Aberrant (Mid Level).**_ One of the dungeoneers who first discovered the gateway beneath [[Bazzoxan]], a lunatic who nonetheless lived out his final days in luxury, has just passed away. The inheritor of his estate is offering a modest reward to any investigators who can locate certain relics of abyssal origin rumored to be hidden in the deceased madman's trapped abode. But what are the intentions of the so-called inheritor, and what danger do these relics pose to the people of [[Xhorhas]]?

### Brokenveil Marsh

The sheer cliffs and ravines of the [[Brokenveil Bluffs]] were created when the [[Dunrock Mountains]] and the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] were sundered in [[the Calamity]]. Between these precipices, a dense morass of thick, stinking marshland claims the valley floor. Gnarled trees and tangle vines clutter the shaded canyons, while sucking mud pits and buzzing insects make travel a slow and arduous experience. All kinds of swamp beasts and sinking muck traps threaten to swallow those who trespass in the marsh, and filthy bluff harpies are eager to pluck away stragglers.

The marsh is a comfortable home for horizonback tortoises, so the challenge often lies in perceiving which dry mound in the Brokenveil is an actual hill and which is the shell of a territorial monster.

The marsh helps discourage the eastern expansion of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and deters the [[Kryn Dynasty]] from pushing farther west. However, nearly two decades of skirmishes between these nations have left many soldiers on both sides buried in the marsh, their bodies forever lost to the dark muck. The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]]'s recent victory at the [[Ashguard Garrison]] has given them control over the marsh and a foothold in the enemy territory beyond it.

### Charis

**Population:** 950 (53% [[dragonborn]], 41% [[halflings]], 6% other [[races]])

**Government:** Two elders preside over this village, one representing its [[dragonborn]] population and the other representing its [[Halflings|halfling]] population.

**Defense:** Numerous bands of experienced fighters, druids, and hunters patrol the area. Civilians know basic combat techniques to defend the village if necessary.

**Commerce:** Travelers can find basic supplies, most likely at a small inn. Visits from traveling merchants are infrequent, so rare goods are special finds.

**Organizations:** A mighty treetop temple to [[Melora]] shades the center of the village.

A wandering community of [[halflings]] survived in the fiend-twisted [[Lotusden Greenwood]] for generations through their cunning and the grace of their faith in [[Melora]]. When they found themselves ambushed by a group of starving [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] fleeing from the destruction of [[Draconia]], the [[halflings]] shunned conflict in favor of kindness. They offered to feed the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]], and a bond between peoples was born.

This burgeoning community of [[halflings]] and [[dragonborn]] was able to carve out a permanent home within a safer region of the Lotusden and, with the blessing of the Wild Mother, ward off the evils of the forest. They gave their woodland village the name [[Charis]], from the [[Draconic]] word for "hope." This hidden hamlet of hollowed trees, moss-covered grottoes, and mushroom fields harbors a nature-worshiping commune of vegetarian farmers, forest guardians, and druids who work to live in harmony with the surrounding forest. They hope to cleanse the Lotusden of the evils that have pervaded its shadows since before the [[Divergence]].

Despite the chaos and turmoil that rock the lands of [[Wildemount]] beyond the [[Lotusden Greenwood]], the people of [[Charis]] are happy in their isolation. Lacking any real interest in outside affairs, they focus entirely on protecting the surrounding forest and their fellow villagers. Outsiders occasionally visit [[Charis]], and while the villagers are welcoming to those who offer no sign of aggression, they usually find a way to quickly usher them along, preferring to be left to their simple lives and pursuits. The people of this village would never consider leaving their tranquil home, unless so commanded by the Wild Mother herself.

The community is small enough that most intricacies of formal government are unnecessary. Volunteers take up responsibilities in shifts, from keeping watch to gathering food. Leaderships is shared between two elders, one for each of the [[Halflings|halfling]] and [[dragonborn]] populations, and their authority is mostly required for giving spiritual guidance and resolving minor disputes.

The society within the village operates without money, gold, or emphasis on precious stones. Everything is provided by the community and shared equally, in theory. In practice, however, disputes do occasionally arise, and [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] who remember their times in the [[Dreemoth Ravine]] sometimes feel compelled to secretly hoard things once considered valuable. While there are no formal laws, if enough citizens feel wronged by an action, they bring the issue before the elders, who will judge the situation and choose a fitting punishment.

Nestled within a sunken meadow surrounded by dense trees and hills, this hidden sanctuary is a beautiful pocket of protected nature within the haunted shadows of the Lotusden. Colorful flowers and fungi line the pathways between stacking treehollow homes and hillside domiciles, and vine-wrapped bridges hang between treetops. Sunbeams pierce the canopy of the forest, bringing vibrant warmth during the day, while moonlight calls faint whispers of mischievous fey into the village to mingle with its denizens.

Finding [[Charis]] is an adventure the characters might undertake to locate a person with a specific item or piece of information that could aid them in another quest.

_**Overlord of the Overgrowth (Mid Level).**_ A demon has made the forest bordering [[Charis]] its lair. Every day, the [hezrou](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hezrou) Garlagrag attempts to summon more and more demons into the forest, and the woods are now flush with hezrous and [dretches](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dretch). The people of [[Charis]] seek aid to fight off the demons or to end Garlagrag's plot once and for all.

### Deepriver Mine and Icozrin Steelworks

Established around a plentiful source of iron and copper within a dry, subterranean riverbed, the [[Deepriver Mine]] is one of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s most productive mining operations. Workers toil away within the mines beneath the red canopy of the Vermaloc, or work the smelters that litter the courtyard, preparing to send their goods to [[Rosohna]] or farther into the west of [[Xhorhas]].

Since the conflict with the [[Dwendalian Empire]] has escalated in recent decades, [[Den]] Icozrin established an impressive steelworks alongside the [[Deepriver Mine]] to expedite the forging of armaments. The Icozrin Steelworks has since grown to become a construction yard for war machines and siege weaponry to be sent to the front lines in the west.

### Dreemoth Ravine

Along the southeastern range of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], an impressively deep gorge cuts into the mountains for nearly eighty miles. Winding and widening, the enormous ravine reveals a beautiful, rocky valley of sparse trees, natural caverns, and incredible waterfalls tumbling from the Ashkeeper runoff. Strong winds blow through the gorge, and the numerous natural cliffside outcroppings provide shelter for wild griffons, wyverns, and other flying beasts. The central bend of the [[Dreemoth Ravine]] still contains the [[ruins of Draconia]], as well as the countless abandoned caves and quarries that once held the enslaved [[Dragonborn|ravenites]], now freed.

Characters might come to [[Dreemoth Ravine]] to capture and train a flying mount, or to explore the [[ruins of Draconia]].

_**Bones of Frigid Doom (Epic Level).**_ A [death knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-knight) named Pentrakath lurks in a cave in the [[Dreemoth Ravine]], and he has uncovered the bones of Vorugal, the [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-[[dragon]]) that destroyed [[Draconia]] twenty years ago. He gathered a host of profane relics and stole the souls of hundreds of dead [[dragonborn]] in an attempt to stitch together a soul powerful enough to resurrect Vorugal as an ancient white dracolich (see [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")).

### Dumaran

The [[hobgoblin]] fortress of [[Dumaran]] is built into the western base of the [[Penumbra Range]], hidden within the south end of the web-infested [[Vermaloc Wildwood]]. Dozens of defensible portholes and arrow slits look down over the walkways that wind across the face of the impressive fortress, while curling paths lead up into the mountains. Within, countless halls, chambers, and tunnels are carved through the rock.

Following [[the Calamity]], the [[hobgoblin]] survivors were scattered, fighting the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]] for scarce resources. They drew the attention of [[Lolth]], the Spider Queen, who seduced and empowered the hobgoblins of [[Dumaran]]. Although they were not [[Dark Elves|drow]], the hobgoblins joined the ranks of the [[Children of Malice]], giving them dominion over the spiders throughout the Vermaloc and honing them into a ferocious army to topple the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] as punishment for their insolence.

Twisted by the dark gifts of their murderous goddess, the hobgoblins of [[Dumaran]] have onyx black fur, pale yellow eyes, and a hunger for slaughter. Their nocturnal hordes strike out in the dark of night, commanding the massive, venomous arachnids of the Vermaloc to aid their raiding parties. Their rituals emphasize their loathing of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] [[Dark Elves|drow]], the same who abandoned their Spider Queen, and they work to slowly build paths through the [[Penumbra Range]] toward [[Rosohna]] to eventually corrupt the city from the shadows.

Like an equally dark mirror of the [[Lolth]]-worshiping [[Dark Elves|drow]] in distant regions of [[Exandria]], the warrior matrons of the [[Children of Malice]] hold power within [[Dumaran]], leading their family houses while serving under Head Matron [[Vivurk Tonn]]. Though many [[Dark Elves|drow]] societies are filled with political scheming and infighting to win [[Lolth]]'s favor, their queen's seething hatred of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] focuses these [[Dark Elves|drow]] against a common enemy, making the forces of [[Dumaran]] a ruthlessly efficient engine of vengeance.

While crimes occur from time to time, the threat of swift and brutal punishment is enough to keep the inhabitants of the fortress in line, unless they are absolutely certain they can get away with a misdeed or prove that their actions further [[Lolth]]'s goals.

Those who serve the Spider Queen in [[Xhorhas]] often pass through [[Dumaran]], and heroes who seek to end her poisonous influence might attempt to destroy the stronghold.

_**Matron of Malice (Mid Level).**_ The [[Kryn Dynasty]] aims to create upheaval within [[Dumaran]] by hiring the characters to infiltrate the fortress and assassinate Head Matron [[Vivurk Tonn]]. To get to her, the characters are given potions that can polymorph them into [[dark elves]] for 24 hours.

_**A Looming Visit (High Level).**_ Intercepted messages between the [[Children of Malice]] speak of a ritual that is being prepared in the heart of [[Dumaran]] in the coming weeks. Victims have been captured for a mass sacrifice, and the messages mention a "great arrival." The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to uncover more information about this ritual, attempt to release any prisoners, and, should the opportunity present itself, stop this ritual or destroy whatever arrives at its completion.

### Fevergulf Lake

[[Fevergulf Lake]] is a massive body of brackish water known for its warm temperature and sulfurous smell. Depending on the season, the waters can become almost scalding in places, causing many of the fish and other creatures that live beneath the surface to migrate from one end of the lake to the other. The banks of the lake collect layers of strange minerals and stones of all colors, creating a rainbow of odd pastel hues among the pebbles, sands, and muck on the lake shore. The immensity of the lake gives plenty of room for all manner of strange terrors to thrive beneath the waters, making it extremely dangerous to cross via boat.

The characters could attempt to cross [[Fevergulf Lake]] without waking its monsters, or they could hunt the denizens beneath.

_**Eyes of the Lake (Any Level).**_ The two islands near the center of the Fevergulf, known as the Eyes of the Lake, are home to rocky shores and twin forests of brown, moss-covered, dead trees. Tall, twisted, and leafless, these woods are ominous enough from a distance, but the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]] still tell fables of a strange, isolated [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] from long ago that lives there to this day, mourning the loss of some long-forgotten god.

### Iothia Moorland

The [[Iothia Moorland]] fills much of the central valley of [[Xhorhas]], a landscape of hilly grasslands and muddy fields that stretches from horizon to horizon, framed by soggy swamps and massive lakes. The Moorland is surprisingly fertile, supporting a robust ecosystem of game and beasts that call the valley home. The roving Dolorav and Koshtask clans claim the Moorlands as their hunting grounds, fighting back the deadly predators that stalk the marshes while also fighting intruders and each other.

The Dolorav clan is a fierce and disciplined warrior tribe, as well as one of the largest [[Humans|human]] societies in [[Eastern Wynandir]]. The Dolorav are descended from the surviving members of the Vukan, who were defeated by the Ki'Nau and their patron Uk'otoa in centuries past. They've now grown into a matriarchal society ruled by a champion called the Skyspear, who is chosen through feats of strength and mental acuity. Tribal warriors gain glory by surviving dangerous trials and rituals, and the majority of the Dolorav hunters and fighters are women.

All who belong to the clan take a blood oath called the Marking as a teenager (or on being accepted into the clan, if they joined later in life). This vow demands celibacy until an appointed mate is chosen by the Skyspear. The clan is a tight-knit community that understands the perilous nature of the land, and is ever vigilant to protect its own and rebuff the attempts of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] to indoctrinate members into [[the Luxon]]'s worship. On rare occasions, the Dolorav clan has been known to ally with the Koshtask clan against a common foe, and recently there have been talks of renewing such a truce to fight the Many Hosts of [[Igrathad]].

At present, the Dolorav clan is recovering from the massacre of their previous leadership by one of their own only a year ago.

The Koshtask clan is a powerful union of ornery [[Orcs|orc]] marauders and abandoned [[wastefolk]] who were left behind when they chose not to follow the clans that joined the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and established [[Igrathad]]. As worshipers of [[Gruumsh]], the Koshtask value efficiency in the kill and take what they want. They prefer fearmongering to diplomacy, and most interactions with the Koshtask end in violence, unless a greater enemy is present against whom they must ally. The current chosen of [[Gruumsh]], a fire-scarred [[Orcs|orc]] called Arakki, leads with cunning and foresight, seeking convenient alliances to ensure his clan's survival, fight off the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] missionaries that seek to convert his people, and eventually betray and destroy those foolish enough to trust them.

#### Iothia Moorland Adventures

These muck-laden fields of swamp and grass hide many lost secrets that have sunk beneath the mud—and deadly denizens intent on keeping those secrets hidden.

_**Lost Resting Place (Mid Level).**_ A disorganized clan of [cyclopes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cyclops) wander the moorland, searching for the grave of their founding champion who died hundreds of years ago. They might parlay with the characters and are willing to trade fine, rare items for aid in seeking out their champion's resting place. When the grave is discovered, the cyclopes immediately begin a ceremony that raises the bones of their founder from the muck into a new existence as a giant. The characters can decide to halt the ritual, angering the cyclopes, or learn later that the clan is terrorizing the tribes of the moorland.

### Jigow

**Population:** 13,210 (56% [[goblinkin]], 31% [[orcs]], 13% other [[races]])

**Government:** The assigned taskhand, Durth Mirimm, has a strained partnership with the two elder leaders of the [[Goblinkin|goblin]] and [[Orcs|orc]] clans.

**Defense:** Taskhand Mirimm's small platoon of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers bolsters the sizable ranks of the local warriors.

**Commerce:** Most basic goods and services can be found here, though their quality reflects their rough and rural origins. Hostels and lodges offer rooms and provisions for travelers.

**Organizations:** A central temple to [[the Luxon]] presides over a district called the Jumble (see "Geography" later in this section). Each clan maintains their own network of artisans and merchants.

A tenuous alliance of [[Goblinkin|goblin]] clans and territorial [[Orcs|orc]] clans once scavenged along the northern shores of [[Xhorhas]], warring and competing for survival. Over the past century, the [[Kryn Dynasty]] has worked to bring the two roving factions together. The negotiations were long and arduous, but the [[Kryn Dynasty]]'s introduction of the faith of [[the Luxon]] ultimately helped the clans to form a unified society.

From these talks, the coastal city of [[Jigow]] rose to become an important source of seafood within the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. A booming fishing society that spreads over both the banks of the Emerald Gulch Sea and the northern Ifolon River, this community of powerful hunters, cunning fishers, and tireless crafters has become a valuable symbol of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s growth and influence.

Despite the peace between the peoples of [[Jigow]], their long-standing rivalries require other outlets wherein they can express their need to conquer and gloat, which is why [[Jigow]] celebrates competition in any form. Whether the rivalry of the day is a contest between hunting parties, a cooking competition, or just children playing sporting games, the people of [[Jigow]] love turning amicable rivalries into a loud and colorful spectacle—especially when they can make bets or help their chosen side cheat to achieve victory.

The beliefs and superstitions of the original Gakthash, Uvuroh, and Zetek [[Goblinkin|goblin]] clans permeate [[Jigow]]'s [[Goblinkin|goblin]] society. Similarly, the honorable traditions of the Norgab and Shoomat [[orcs]] continue to guide their people. While some have adopted the beliefs of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], many resist the teachings of the [[Dark Elves|drow]], as they feel that the presence of [[Dark Elves|drow]] is suffocating their own culture. The mounting tensions between the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] and the people of [[Jigow]] are only further exacerbated by the worry that the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s war will spill into [[Jigow]] territory.

Taskhand Durth Mirimm represents the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s interests first and foremost, putting the needs of [[Jigow]]'s residents a distant second. His controversial judgments are often challenged by the most vocal of the clan elders: Elder Cubu-Ka, an elderly [[Goblinkin|goblin]] who enjoys frustrating the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] representatives, and Elder Ushru, an aging [[Orcs|orc]] hunter eager to maintain the cultural heritage of his people. To the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], maintaining order resembles a handful of adults failing to keep unruly children under control. The native people of [[Jigow]], however, see their willfulness as a way to establish boundaries against a clueless enforcer.

While members of the [[Aurora Watch]] do their best to keep things under control, a constant hum of small-scale thefts can't be quelled. Between watching their own pockets, the occasional violent confrontation from a contest gone sour, and illegal attempts to undermine a competitor's business, the Watch is perpetually overworked, which only invites more shenanigans from the people of [[Jigow]].

[[Jigow]] is more of a collection of coastal villages than a singular, central city. The settlement is comprised of a chain of settlements clustered among the trees of the shoreline. The main docks, known as the Meatwaters, lie on the westernmost shore, where the fishing industry thrives due to the healthy marine ecosystem. The central villages, called the Jumble, sit slightly farther from the coast, built among the massive mangrove trees and nomadic horizonback tortoises that serve as roving homesteads. The eastern edges, known as the Wetwalks, are filled with huts and shacks built on stilts over the low wetland patches where grains are cultivated in the paddies amid the reeds.

Characters in [[Jigow]] might get pulled into local competitions, or they might be keeping an eye on the populace for the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], who are trying to avoid a revolt.

_**Battle of the Braggarts (Low Level).**_ At a tavern, the adventurers witness two braggarts engage in a boast-off. The two boasters, a battle-scarred old [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc) named Temgor and a young [goblin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/goblin) named Gerb, are both prideful and refuse to back down. It seems like the conflict is going to come to blows, and both Temgor and Gerb's friends separately ask the adventurers to defuse the tensions before the [[Aurora Watch]] gets involved.

### Lotusden Greenwood

The dark, verdant forest of the [[Lotusden Greenwood]] envelops the southern end of [[Eastern Wynandir]] in eerie mists, murderous trolls, and hungry trees. Incredibly lush and filled with life compared to the barren and desolate wastes to the north, this unchecked forest is home to many creatures and beasts, some of whom have grown to a nightmarish size because of the residual power of the long-buried druidic fane that empowers and protects the Greenwood.

Giant predators and dire monstrosities stalk the undergrowth, while vicious, carnivorous plants patiently await their next meal. Cold nights bring icy mists to the wood, drawing the spirits of those claimed by the Lotusden out into the moonlight to siphon the warmth from the living. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] considers exploiting the mysterious and deadly forest to be an unnecessary risk, so the [[Lotusden Greenwood]] remains one of the few places on this side of the [[Penumbra Range]] untouched by [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] interests.

No one knows the source of the wild curses that plague the Lotusden, but there are a number of stories that speak of whole portions of the forest suddenly coming to life. The trees uproot themselves and march as one, going berserk and assaulting any they perceive as outsiders—until mysteriously, and without warning, they take root again and return to their docile, unmoving state. While academics maintain that there is no definitive proof of this behavior, some explorers have noticed the shape of the forest's edges changing dramatically, sometimes overnight.

The characters might enter the forest to retrieve someone who is lost or to escape [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] forces in pursuit. Any plant in [[Lotusden Greenwood]] could be a carnivorous monster waiting to attack.

_**Mother's Milk (Mid Level).**_ Someone or something has been kidnapping the infants and children of [[Charis]]. A terrible evil lurks at the heart of the matter: an unholy coven of hags, led by a [night hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/night-hag) of prodigious influence and power. The hag preside over a dark corner of the Greenwood, where they lair beneath the roots of a gargantuan tree. Here, the nightmarish coven and its minions manufacture the slow doom of the Greenwood itself as they siphon the lifeblood of the [[Charis]] children into a loathsome artifact known as the Gloom Lathe.

### Many Hosts of Igrathad

**Population:** 6,750 (41% [[goblinkin]], 19% [[orcs]], 15% humanoids, 25% other [[races]])

**Government:** A local leader governs independently alongside a [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] representative in each of the seven villages. The village leaders occasionally convene as a council.

**Defense:** A small force of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers weave through the villages, and each village maintains its own army of warriors.

**Commerce:** Most goods or services can be found within the villages, though it might take some searching, and strange or rare commodities are occasionally available from merchants or scavengers. Inns and taverns are scattered throughout the villages.

**Organizations:** Small shrines and temples can be found in each village, and they each maintain their own marketplace and merchant unions. The [[Children of Malice]] have begun to infiltrate many of the villages.

South of the [[Sorrowseep Waters]], where the fields are more fertile, lies a scattered network of seven villages with robust communities of [[goblinkin]], [[orcs]], and giants, known as the Many Hosts of [[Igrathad]]. The seven villages are Kranad, Broonbobah, Aruuth, Oshinik-Ka, Wrathfall, Unyeethi, and Dodafir.

All seven villages were built on a central battleground where the factions of this region feuded and warred over resources and glory. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] reached out to the village leaders nearly a century ago and managed to broker a peace to halt the bloodshed. This disparate community is a uniquely powerful, if quarrelsome, ally to the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]].

Over the generations of fighting each other as well as the roving clans of nomads that wander the [[Iothia Moorland]], the many people of [[Igrathad]] have come to prize displays of combat prowess and hunting skills. Children are trained with arms from an early age, and the Many Hosts are respected as the finest warriors in the region, making them feared soldiers within the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s military forces.

While the villages of [[Igrathad]] have enjoyed the fruits of a somewhat collaborative society under the guidance of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], the centuries of turmoil have not been forgotten. Neighbors argue over territory, and youths challenge each other for social dominance. The people take pride in the unique history of their own village, and that pride can win out over the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s message of unity. Interactions between the villages often grow tense when the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] aren't around to keep the peace. This isn't helped by the fact that a record number of able-bodied villagers from [[Igrathad]] have been sent north to fight on the front lines of the war. The center of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]]'s government is far away from [[Igrathad]], and many of the Dens are concerned that the tenuous union between the Many Hosts is crumbling.

Each of the seven villages has its own leader, who is usually chosen for their lineage or with a contest of strength. Each leader is assigned a representative from [[Rosohna]] to help enforce the will of the Bright Queen, though the leaders often disagree with various facets of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s decrees, making total unity challenging. The various leaders meet in a public space to make most major decisions and judgments: they debate and sometimes duel to resolve the matters before them. While this unconventional court is not consistent with the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s intended order, few of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] representatives find the will to argue.

Some [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers keep the peace and manage the day-to-day quarrels within [[Igrathad]]. However, the majority of the Hosts' people are expertly trained warriors, so they both handle their own problems and make it difficult to enforce any laws on them. The idea of attempting to punish or incapacitate a criminal ogre or angered giant keeps all but the strongest from taking a post in [[Igrathad]].

The seven villages are connected by muddy paths that cut through the rocky grassland. Each village has its own culture, complete with distinct customs and religious practices:

**Kranad** began as a [[bugbear]] clan of the same name and is made up of wooden shanties built around stands of trees.

**Broonbobah** is a village of goblins, where clusters of huts and rickety wood structures climb high to oversee the surrounding plains.

**Aruuth** is home to the enduring [[Orcs|orc]] people of the Aruuth-Uk clan, once the dominant clan of the area. The stone village is built around a prominent, deep-set vein of iron that provides ore to the villages.

**Oshinik-Ka** is a village of the [[hobgoblin]] folk, who reside in stone bunkers behind barricades that markedly push the militant air of life within.

**Wrathfall** is the village of humanoid outlanders who never joined with the Odarami or the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]]. It is little more than a few scattered clusters of yurts.

**Unyeethi** is home to the [[Gnolls|gnoll]] clan of the same name. It is the least social of the villages. The [[gnolls]] live in primitive huts made from bark, furs, and bones.

**Dodafir** is the fortress village of hill giants that marks the southernmost borough of [[Igrathad]]. The fortress is made of great logs crudely fitted together, with roofs made of bark tiles and thatch.

Characters could come to [[Igrathad]] seeking help from a powerful giant, or to help keep the villages united, or, conversely, to try to drive them apart.

_**Necromancer's Army (Mid Level).**_ An exiled Dolorav necromancer has allied himself with a clan of bloodthirsty [minotaurs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/minotaur) to manufacture an army of undead, whose slow expansion poses a threat to [[Igrathad]]. Each of [[Igrathad]]'s seven villages appoints a champion to march with Dolorav and Koshtask warriors against this cruel usurper and his legion of unholy monstrosities. The characters must join the fight if they want the villages to help them with some other matter.

### Penumbra Range

Dividing the marshes and badlands of [[Xhorhas]] from the ghastly boneyards of the [[Blightshore]], the [[Penumbra Range]] is an unusually steep series of black rock mountains that rise against the horizon like a huge jaw of pointed teeth. Hiking across the sharp, glassy rock is an extremely dangerous feat that would challenge even the most experienced travelers.

### Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)

**Population:** 113,190 (66% [[dark elves]], 9% goblins, 7% [[duergar]], 18% other [[races]])

**Government:** The twelve ruling [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] Dens oversee the city, all at the command of [[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] and the Bright Queen herself.

**Defense:** A mighty army of [[Aurora Watch]] protects the city, while mounted weapons and ballistae stand at the ready. Each [[Den]] employs personal guards, as well as highly trained bodyguards for their nobles.

**Commerce:** Most any goods or services can be found within the city, with distant imports available on the black market.

**Organizations:** The majority of temples here are dedicated to [[the Luxon]], but smaller shrines to the rest of the pantheon are scattered throughout in the outer districts. The merchant guilds are organized by the Dens and closely tied to the faith of [[the Luxon]]. Agents of the [[Children of Malice]] are sown like seeds of chaos throughout the city.

The realm of [[Xhorhas]] was home to the strongholds of the Betrayer Gods as they walked the realm of mortals, but the beating heart of their mercurial alliance was the dark city of [[Ghor Dranas]] (meaning "gathering of shadows" in [[Draconic]]). A monument to the union of tyranny and chaos, the shaded skies framed the dozens of crooked towers and war barracks that surrounded the central citadel of Virkwzual, or "Dark Bastion" in the [[Infernal]] language. The final battles of [[the Calamity]] were waged around [[Ghor Dranas]], and much of the city was reduced to ash and dust. Towers crumbled, the ground opened to swallow the legions of the Betrayers, and the citadel was left sundered and abandoned. It wasn't until the surviving [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] [[Dark Elves|drow]] emerged from the [[Underdark]] that the city rose from its ashes.

The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] slowly cleared the ruins of the corrupt creatures that had claimed it for so long. They built new structures on the foundations of the ancient city while expanding the underground levels beneath, bringing new life to the city of [[Ghor Dranas]], which they named [[Rosohna]], or "Rebirth," in their tongue.

[[Rosohna]] is the center of the powerful [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] society, a symbol of dark history reclaimed. Its tall, dusky spires and beautiful buildings rise from the broken shards of [[the Calamity]]. Breaks in the constant cloud cover offer glimpses of sunlight, which is seen as a holy gift shining on the many monuments to [[the Luxon]]. Crystalline halls of glass and quartz glow with interior light in the traditional [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] hues of green and purple.

The streets are lively with city-dwelling [[wastefolk]], [[the Luxon]]-worshiping [[Dark Elves|drow]] who live beneath the open sky to spite [[Lolth]]'s design, and even a few [[duergar]] and other beings from the [[Underdark]]. Local businesses thrive as the [[Xhorhas|Xhorhasian]] community grows, and goblinoid merchants have found profit and comfort within this [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] civilization. Even so, most people beyond the borders of [[Xhorhas]] only see [[Rosohna]] as an unbroken link in the legacy of [[Ghor Dranas]], a city born of malevolent gods and their murderous spawn.

As the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] discovered their cycle of reincarnation, many began to find beings outside the [[Dark Elves|drow]] lineage undergoing anamnesis, the process in which a creature reincarnated by a [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) begins to recall memories from its past lives. Unexpectedly, the spirits of heroic [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] were reborn in various intelligent creatures outside the [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] society. With this knowledge, the ruling dens of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] began to reevaluate their treatment of non-[[Dark Elves|drow]], instead seeking to bring the light of [[the Luxon]] to the [[wastefolk]] of [[Xhorhas]]. While many beings across [[Xhorhas]] and beyond still cultivate mutual animosity toward the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], there is a growing number of goblins, ogres, [[gnolls]], [[orcs]], and many other beings who have found a new home and purpose under the rule of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. Thanks to the miracle of anamnesis, [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] society has become a diverse and thriving community that spreads across [[Xhorhas]].

The [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] and [[duergar]] bloodlines are averse to sunlight, which presents a challenge to a culture that journeyed to the surface out of love for their light-bearing god. Periods of worship involve occasional prayer and meditation in the warmth of daylight, but twelve hours of daylight each day can become painful and physically detrimental to those beings adapted to subterranean life. To mitigate this problem, powerful [[Dunamancy|dunamancers]] have woven arcane shields to temporarily block out the sun above [[Rosohna]]. Periods of days, sometimes weeks, will transpire in a state of perpetual evening, enabling the darkness-bound denizens to go about their work. Such periods briefly come to an end to usher in periods of scheduled, mass worship under the sunlight.

#### Above and Below

[[Rosohna]] is built on the remains of [[Ghor Dranas]], and an entire, unseen level of the city lurks beneath the surface. These caves and tunnels were used as torture dungeons by worshipers of [[Torog]], and the Dens of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] have spent centuries reclaiming the space for their own people. Much of the dungeon remains abandoned, but a great many layers have been cleared and transformed into underground neighborhoods, hubs for subterranean travel across [[Wildemount]], and farming caverns for crops of edible fungi. However, the [[Kryn Dynasty]] has secretly allowed some hidden chambers to fulfill their original grim purpose as cells for vile criminals and political prisoners.

The ruling class of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] is seated in [[Rosohna]], spread across twelve noble Dens—all of whom seek to one day rule the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. They play an intricate political game by expanding their families of timeless souls and covertly undermining the authority of other Dens.

Each [[Den]] traditionally oversees a portion of local industry, but the more distinguished Dens also vie for control over aspects of spiritual or military leadership. [[Den]] Masters keep a careful eye out for weakness among other Dens, seeking ways to sully the reputations of their rivals while displaying their own worthiness to the Bright Queen. Such social sabotage is reminiscent of the old ways of the [[Dark Elves|drow]], but assassinations and acts of outright violence are rare. The three ruling Dens—[[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], [[Den]] Thelyss, and [[Den]] Mirimm—are each helmed by an [[Umavi]]. Of those families, [[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] holds supreme power, for its head is Bright Queen [[Leylas Kryn]] herself.

Conflict and struggle are as common in [[Rosohna]] as in any other metropolis, and though the unifying faith of [[the Luxon]] helps maintain the peace between disparate and sometimes violent residents, old habits are hard to break. [[Den]] Mirimm has enacted a tough, sometimes brutal approach to law enforcement that helps discourage violent behavior.

Blackmail is common between political figures, and those that indulge in this vice believe that they can absolve any sins through pious prayer, reasoning that their actions are only illegal if they're caught.

Those who have been found guilty of major crimes against the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] are locked away in the [[Dungeon of Penance]] (see "Geography" below), or taken out beyond the reach of the beacons and executed, with no hope of rebirth.

Nestled protectively within a deep valley alongside the [[Penumbra Range]], the majestic, ominous, and beautiful city long known as [[Ghor Dranas]] stands as a symbol of renewal and change. A vast medley of bright and wondrous structures, grandiose towers, and crystalline cathedrals soar into the sky, thriving among the broken remnants of a ruined metropolis that was once nothing but ash and haunted memories. Districts are laid out in the husk of the ancient capital like a series of layers, each ward growing more refined and enlightened the closer one gets to the center of the city. These layers are [[the Ghostlands]], the [[Coronas]], the [[Gallimaufry]], the [[Firmaments]], the [[Shadowshire]], the [[Lucid Bastion]], and the [[Dungeon of Penance]].

_**The Ghostlands.**_ Large sections of the foreboding obsidian walls that once surrounded the city have fallen, but they are in the process of being rebuilt as the war with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] grows more violent. Within these walls, the outlying Ghostlands remain empty, haunted by ghosts and shadows, the razed structures and barracks of the larger, ancient city left to crumble to dust. Two functional roads known as the Hallowed Paths allow caravans, travelers, and military forces to reach the city.

_**Coronas.**_ Most of the city's poorer citizens are scattered throughout this sprawling, foggy district of salvaged structures and newer homesteads. Patches of magically maintained farmland are tilled and tended by nearby denizens, while industrial factories and bellows release stacks of black smoke and faintly colored steam. [[Aurora Watch]] captains coordinate law enforcement from three fortresses, while mercenaries, volunteers, and desperate folk often strike out into [[the Ghostlands]] with hopes of exorcising new neighborhoods to shelter the continuously growing population of [[Rosohna]].

_**Gallimaufry.**_ Deeper into the heart of [[Rosohna]] is the massive region called the [[Gallimaufry]]. The rowdiest and most vibrant ward of the city, the [[Gallimaufry]] marks the intersection of culture and commerce where citizens come to share ideas, peddle wares and services, find employment, or celebrate personal victories large and small in the company of other folk from the wastes. The area is lit with ever-burning lanterns of green light strung across street corners and roadways, and the percussive music of the [[wastefolk]] mingles with the haunting melodies of [[Dark Elves|drow]] musicians to produce an ever-shifting atmosphere that many find at once both welcoming and claustrophobic.

_**Firmaments.**_ Near the center of [[Rosohna]], travelers will find the [[Firmaments]], where the haunted memory of [[Ghor Dranas]] has been erased with a beautiful district of glowing [[Dark Elves|drow]] gardens, luxurious chapels to [[the Luxon]], and the spacious halls of Marble Tomes Conservatory, the city's center of higher learning. Wealthy estates house [[Den]] members and figures of import to the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], and the impressive towers of the Nimbus Keep loom over the region. The Nimbus Keep is the center of the [[Aurora Watch]] and the first of two paths to the [[Dungeon of Penance]] beneath the city.

_**Lucid Bastion.**_ Located at the very center of [[Rosohna]] is the awe-inspiring and towering citadel of the [[Lucid Bastion]]. This impressive cathedral is built from the ruins of Virkwzual and now stands as the symbol of [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] rebirth and their faith in the light of [[the Luxon]]. The [[Lucid Bastion]]'s spires of gray quartz pierce the sky, and the soft interior glow that suffuses the interior chambers never darkens, shining over the city day and night. Major religious events are centered around the Bastion, for it houses the "heart of [[consecution]]," the first [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) to have been discovered. Within these halls, the Bright Queen, her trusted [[Umavi]], and their Dens work to govern and protect all citizens of the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

_**Shadowshire.**_ Several well-guarded stairways curl beneath the [[Firmaments]], descending under the surface of [[Xhorhas]] into the [[Shadowshire]], a vast subterranean district built throughout the reclaimed prisons of [[Torog]]. Less affluent [[dark elves]] live among the stone and glass abodes built into the rock and sediment. Caverns amass bioluminescent fungi to be harvested for food and medicine, while enchanted lanterns light the various levels with a soft and many-colored luminescence. A magical underground farmland has been established here, where sunless crops are grown to feed the city. The second entrance of the [[Dungeon of Penance]] is located within the [[Shadowshire]].

_**Dungeon of Penance.**_ The many levels of the [[Dungeon of Penance]] delve under the city. This terrifying oubliette bears the marks of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]'s renovations on its upper levels, but become less explored and less changed from the days of [[Ghor Dranas]] the deeper one delves.

As the largest prison within the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], a microcosm of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] itself can be found in the complex bureaucracy of jailors, supervisors, and elite [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers who guard the frigid halls of the dungeon.

To outsiders, [[Rosohna]] is a city of bizarre wonders, but to its residents, it is simply home—a place of business, crime, worship, and more. All kinds of adventures await in this diverse city.

_**An Early Dawn (Any Level).**_ While the characters are visiting [[Rosohna]], the shadows above the city suddenly disappear, letting in harsh light that hinders the [drow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow) and [duergar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/duergar) residents. Is this phenomenon part of an imminent attack, or did the [[Kryn Dynasty]] anger [[the Luxon]] and must figure out a way to regain their god's favor?

_**A Bloody Dawn (Mid Level).**_ During a particularly clear day, the [priests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest) of [[the Luxon]] dispel the darkness above the city for a moment of prayer. While the denizens bask in the light, agents of the [[Children of Malice]] strike, attacking and trying to kidnap influential members of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s clergy. The characters must stop the assault, root out the hidden traitors behind this plan, and save any surviving prisoners.

_**Ghor Dranas Returns (Epic Level).**_ The [[Cerberus Assembly]] sends several disguised [archmages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage) to reopen the sealed rifts in [[Rosohna]], hoping to destroy the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] by filling the city with otherworldly threats. The characters might be part of the plot, or they might work to stop it.

### Ruins of Draconia

At the bottom of the deep [[Dreemoth Ravine]] lie the crumbled ruins of the once-proud nation of [[Draconia]]. The floating islands of the city-state were the original home of [[dragonborn]] society within [[Wildemount]], though the ruling class installed a strict caste system and forced the tailless [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] [[dragonborn]] to labor in the ravine below their magically elevated island city. When the city was assaulted by [[the Chroma Conclave]] two decades before, the islands were sundered and fell into the ravine, killing many of the inhabitants. However, this disaster gave the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] a chance to rebel against their cruel masters.

The plundered ruins of the former city are now abandoned heaps of rock and rubble, a dismal memorial to the ignominious end of a glorious, cruel civilization.

The [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] did have allies among the ruling houses. Many Draconian citizens disagreed with the oppression of their brethren and fought for generations to overturn the laws that kept them enslaved. Others aided the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] in their emancipation after the fall of [[Draconia]]; those folk came out on top in the end, for they're considered honored members of the emerging [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] society.

Those champions who were lost in the struggle are immortalized in statues left among the ruins, the most famous of whom is the hero Tiberius Stormwind of [[Draconia]]. Tiberius was one of the legendary heroes of Vox Machina, and he gave his life to defend [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] from the ire of Vorugal, the white [[dragon]] of [[the Chroma Conclave]]. His statue and surrounding shrine are a place of pilgrimage for [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] historians.

Those brave enough to delve into the [[ruins of Draconia]] can find treasures and a few ghosts of the destroyed city.

_**Former Glory (Low Level).**_ A cabal of disaffected [[Dragonborn|draconblood]] [[dragonborn]] have been secretly assembling in the ruins of their former metropolis. They are guided by the whispers of a [death knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-knight) who promises them the power to reassert control over the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]]. They have begun learning necromancy and even making minor sacrifices in his name. The death knight, Pentrakath, is currently gathering artifacts elsewhere in [[Wildemount]], but will soon use his cultists and [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] fanatics to carry out his twisted plans, if no one intervenes (see "[Dreemoth Ravine Adventures](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-wastes-of-xhorhas#DreemothRavineAdventures "[[Dreemoth Ravine]] Adventures")" earlier in this chapter).

### Sorrowseep Waters

The [[Sorrowseep Waters]] are one of the twin lakes that dominate the central wastes of [[Xhorhas]]. These dark waters are home to a curious ecosystem of swamp beasts, amphibious behemoths, [[moorbounders]], and apocryphal creatures said to live within the lake itself. Fishers, hunters, and trappers often brave the surrounding knotted boughs and stinking mud of Sorrowseep Marsh in search of unique prey, while healers or their hirelings also risk the journey to collect the waters of the lake, which are believed to have restorative qualities. The crisp waters of the lake branch out across the wastelands of [[Xhorhas]], feeding rivers and sustaining life throughout the scarred plains.

The true depth of the Sorrowseep has yet to be discovered due to the density of vegetation near the bottom, called the Tanglebed. Scholars believe that something ancient and powerful sleeps at the bottom of the lake, and that such a creature could be the source of the lake's unique plant growth, unnaturally clean waters, and possible healing properties.

Characters exploring the [[Sorrowseep Waters]] encounter all manner of strange creatures and eccentric denizens.

_**Something Borrowed (Low Level).**_ One of the characters is contacted by a close childhood friend or family member to announce their sudden betrothal to a passionate love interest. This union is taboo, however, for the love interest is actually a [green hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/green-hag). The character is invited to be a member of the wedding party—but something about this marriage seems fishy.

_**Entangled (High Level).**_ A [[Gnomes|gnome]] inventor claims to have created a submersible vessel that can survive the lightless journey through the Tanglebed, past the known depths of the Sorrowseep. He hires the characters to help him helm the machine. Together, they discover a mysterious location beneath the lake, where a [marid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/marid) is gathering a [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] to purge the nearby rivers of civilization.

### Urzin

**Population:** 5,930 (62% goblinoids, 21% [[gnolls]], 10% [[orcs]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government:** The reigning champion of [[Urzin]], [[Sunbreaker Olomon]], guides the townsfolk, who follow with zeal and dedication.

**Defense:** A legion of [[Aurora Watch]] defends the town, while the hordes of [[Urzin]] hunters scout the marsh. The horizonback tortoises that bear the town on their backs are more than capable of defending themselves.

**Commerce:** Trade in [[Urzin]] is fairly basic and geared toward survival and warfare. Many common goods can be bought or traded for, but rarer items are coveted and appear infrequently. Inns are very rare.

**Organizations:** Some small Luxon temples travel on tortoise-back alongside shrines to older [[goblinkin]] patrons.

A uniquely mobile settlement with its permanent dwellings built on the backs of dozens of horizonback tortoises, [[Urzin]] is home to swamp hunters, scouts, and trappers that know the [[Brokenveil Marsh]] like no one else. The most recent society to come under the wing of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], [[Urzin]] acts as a powerful, mobile fortress for the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] military throughout the [[Brokenveil Marsh]]. The settlement rarely stays in one location for more than a month, and its people are skilled at the art of camouflage and ambush. [[Urzin]] has become a major boon to the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] as the conflict with the [[Dwendalian Empire]] escalates.

The [[swampfolk]] of [[Urzin]] have always prized strength and guile: their leader is simply the reigning champion of one-on-one combat. The previous champion, Ogre Lord Buhfal, ruled the settlement for decades, assaulting the encroaching [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and fighting off the dangers of the marsh. Roughly forty years ago, Buhfal was challenged by the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] paragon [[Sunbreaker Olomon]]. In what is still retold as legend, a mighty bout between the two ended with Buhfal defeated and Olomon elevated to rule the settlement.

With his guidance, Olomon brought the teachings of [[the Luxon]], in the name of the Bright Queen, and promised that with the hearts of the [[Urzin]] people behind him and his [[Dark Elves|drow]], the terrible soldiers of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] would no longer terrorize the marshfolk. Renewed by this promise, [[Urzin]] follows the lead of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] with an impressive fervor, working like clockwork to achieve any goal dictated by Olomon. In his absence, Ogre Lord Buhfal II proudly fills the role of leader and protector.

A large number of the denizens of [[Urzin]] make their homes atop the shells of the horizonbacks, but many also carry temporary tents and makeshift abodes that allow a home to be made wherever they find themselves. Whole packs of tortoises reconfigure daily, and often the settlement breaks up and scatters across the marsh for periods of time, leaving satellite outposts all over the region before reforming elsewhere among the muck. Because of this, the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] military finds the movements of [[Urzin]] hard to track and even harder to predict.

While there is a comparatively thin presence of authoritarian [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers among the ever-shifting boundaries of [[Urzin]], [[Sunbreaker Olomon]] and his appointed council are treated with reverence and their orders are followed with impressive zeal. The culture of [[Urzin]] prizes unity and adherence to the wishes of their champion, so [[Urzin]]'s governance at times seems strangely smooth compared to other locations in the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. While Olomon is away on other business, the Urzinians can become restless or slower to follow instruction, but this insubordination lasts only until his return.

Criminal activity within the settlement is rare, given the zealous nature of the marshfolk. Dissent within the ranks is often punished with exile, so the few that do disobey find themselves ostracized and left to survive alone among the foggy dangers of the marsh.

The town of [[Urzin]] consists of around forty horizonback tortoises and many hundreds of mobile tents and huts that shift with every relocation. The backs of these tortoises are covered front to back in rickety shacks and barracks, sometimes stacked in wild towers, with long ropes and vines anchoring them in place. The horizonback shells are reinforced at the edges with jagged pikes and sharpened bones to help defend those who live atop, while bolt throwers and short-range catapults can be found throughout the neighborhoods. Every tortoise contains its own microcosm of a village, and denizens all take up skills to make the miniature community nearly self-sufficient, complete with moss farmers, blacksmiths, and physicians.

Note that any specific indicator of [[Urzin]]'s location on a map is an approximation of its location, due to the roving nature of the community.

[[Urzin]] moving through the marsh

Just finding the settlement and winning the trust of the people of [[Urzin]] is an adventure. Characters on the run could also try to hide in [[Urzin]], since the settlement does the running for them.

_**Horizonback Horror (Mid Level).**_ A [horizonback tortoise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/horizonback-tortoise) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#HorizonbackTortoise "[[chapter 7]]")) has broken away from [[Urzin]]'s fleet and is rampaging through [[Jigow]]. The [[orcs]] and [[goblinkin]] fought to contain it, but every wound they inflict on the beast seems to stitch together before their eyes! An [oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oni) that once led a clan of trolls the [[orcs]] defeated several months ago is out for revenge and devised an alchemical infusion created from troll blood. The oni administered the toxin to the tortoise, granting it the Regeneration feature of a troll and causing it to go berserk, terrifying not only the denizens of [[Jigow]], but also the people clinging to their homes atop the frenzied tortoise.

### Vermaloc Wildwood

The [[Vermaloc Wildwood]] is an enormous timberland of vibrant trees with deep purple and maroon trunks and a bright canopy of red-orange leaves. This curious and beautiful burst of color stands in stark contrast to the often dreary landscape of [[Xhorhas]]. Many denizens of [[Xhorhas]] have camps or small settlements along the treeline, as the forest is one of the major sources of wood and logging throughout the wastes. Those who live here, however, remain alert for the many deadly beasts and creatures that call this colorful expanse home. Monstrous predators twisted long ago by the Betrayer Gods hunt from the trees and brush, while the deeper woods are overrun with the webs of the malicious giant spiders that claim those shaded regions. Only the most experienced and well-armed hunters dare wander the depths of the Vermaloc.

[[Vermaloc Wildwood]]

The characters might hunt in the [[Vermaloc Wildwood]] to prove their mettle or be forced to survive a journey through the wood.

_**Ettercap's Web (Low Level).**_ Aramue, a [dryad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dryad) of the [[Vermaloc Wildwood]] and devout follower of the Wild Mother, possesses a unique gift: she can send dreams to other worshipers of [[Melora]]. Using this power, she reaches out to such individuals. Aramue needs help ridding her forest of an [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ettercap) that has taken control of many of the forest's [giant spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider). The spiders attack the forest's outlying settlements and bring prisoners to the ettercap, which it sacrifices to gain [[Lolth]]'s favor. The dryad is kept awake at night by the ettercap's screaming victims.

### Verstglade

A small valley of crooked, leafless trees is hidden in the tallest peaks of the southern [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], though few know of its existence. During the [[Age of Arcanum]], this dark and menacing wood once was an experimental playground for the terrible lich [[Vecna]], where he would manipulate and twist all manner of life, arcana, and undead to his sick whims. The countless years of misuse left the withered forest corrupt and overrun with nightmarish abominations and cursed, undying minions who were abandoned to their madness. Mercifully, [[Vecna]] was banished before he could unleash his creations on [[Wildemount]], and his aspirations for godhood left his intended plots with [[Verstglade]] forgotten.

[[Verstglade]] is filled with forgotten experiments that characters might be asked to retrieve or destroy.

_**The Whispered Study (High Level).**_ Cloaked by illusion and filled with deadly traps, one of the primary laboratories of [[Vecna]] remains hidden within the [[Verstglade]]. It is home to many powerful artifacts and arcane secrets, and the promise of such mighty rewards draws a bold few to attempt to locate it. Of the few mortal minds that even know of [[Verstglade]] and what lies hidden within it, only brave adventurers or the minions of evil are foolish enough to enter the corrupted woods.

### Xarzith Kitril

**Population:** 9,110 (93% [[dragonborn]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government:** A council of six oversees the city, with the Wardens of the Ravine keeping order under their guidance.

**Defense:** An army of Wardens of the Ravine are ever at the ready to defend the city. Many self-trained citizens can form a militia if need be.

**Commerce:** Trade is mostly limited to the city, making rare goods hard to find. Most basic equipment, arms, and services can be found here, as well as taverns and lodging.

**Organizations:** Small, rough sanctums of worship can be found within the city. Unions of artisans and merchants work together on a small scale.

Shortly after the fall of [[Draconia]], when the lords of the ruined city-state were deposed and scattered, the remaining [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] [[dragonborn]] took the reins of their new freedom and began to develop a new [[dragonborn]] society in [[Wildemount]]. The [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] have spent nearly two decades building a new city of hope for the [[dragonborn]] survivors within the cliffs of the [[Dreemoth Ravine]]. The fortified stone city of [[Xarzith Kitril]] continues to grow, and its borders are constantly being rebuilt to accommodate its exploding centers of residence and industry amid the ore-bearing mines and tall smoke pillars from ever-burning forges. The leaders of the city, members of the newly formed [[Scars of Scale and Tooth]], work to bring unity to the fractured, feuding [[Dragonborn|ravenites]].

When the city of [[Draconia]] fell, the surviving [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] enjoyed a brief moment of freedom before the terrifying, ancient white [[dragon]] Vorugal the Frigid Doom claimed the ruins and the surrounding ravine as his new lair. The [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] were freshly bound by fear under their new overlord, whose presence plunged the ravine into an endless winter. It wasn't until Vorugal was slain by the heroes of Vox Machina that the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]]' chains were truly shattered. As the heavy ice melted away, the new city's construction began, and the city took the name [[Xarzith Kitril]], [[Draconic]] for "ice born."

[[Xarzith Kitril]] represents a new dawn for the [[dragonborn]] people, and many of the citizens place personal pride in what their city stands for and what they believe it will eventually become. However, the council of new leadership, known as the [[Scars of Scale and Tooth]], continues to debate over the direction and development of the city, unable to agree on a clear vision of the future. Some wish to see the city rise in prominence and respect. Others wish to keep the city isolated. The populace grows restless and frustrated without united leadership.

With the support of the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]] behind them, a council of six agreed to form the Scars and govern the city. Ruling by committee, however, sometimes leads to disagreements and slow progress. In particular, Vermosi Runek and [[Druvis Koothalok]] differ greatly on the perceived priorities of the city. Vermosi rules with religious passion and wants to remain in isolation to spite the worldly ways of the previous rulers of [[Draconia]], while Druvis seeks the benefits from forging alliances with neighboring powers. As this and similar arguments continue to escalate, governing the growing city is becoming challenging.

Local law enforcement is comprised entirely of a force of volunteer soldiers called the Wardens of the Ravine. The Wardens truly believe in the future of the city and the [[Scars of Scale and Tooth]], and they vigilantly maintain the peace and prevent criminal activity. Unfortunately, resources are relatively scarce, and the recent introduction of trade with the [[Menagerie Coast]] has brought an influx of coin into the previously barter-based society. As such, theft and racketeering are on the rise.

Constructed within the thinner, southern end of the [[Dreemoth Ravine]], this city of sturdy stone structures has expanded into the walls of the ravine on either side. Abodes are stacked along the cliffs and entwined with winding stairways and gondola platforms that glide across the open crevasse, elevated with recovered chunks of [[brumestone]] that once held the floating islands of [[Draconia]] aloft.

The central, base region of the city is referred to as the Roots, where the majority of commerce and industry meets the political core of the [[Scars of Scale and Tooth]]. The West Wall region is a tall, nearly vertical neighborhood of homes built into the rocky western cliff face of the ravine above the Dreemoth Quarry. The East Wall region looks similar to its western counterpart, though at a slightly less extreme grade, and houses three separate major mine shafts that are peppered with residential caves and abodes. Dozens of cords and chains stretch from ravine wall to ravine wall, allowing people and goods to move between them on the floating [[brumestone]] platforms.

All manner of adventures and challenges await within this recovering [[dragonborn]] society.

_**Best Left Alone (Mid Level).**_ One of the prominent mining companies within the city has recently uncovered a mysterious purple stone of unknown origin, about fifteen feet in diameter. Dozens of superstitious miners have fled this site, so the company hires the characters to investigate the stone and uncover its nature. When any of the stone's smooth, reflective surface takes damages, this buried relic of the Shadowfell begins to summon [shadowghasts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/shadowghast) and [gloomstalkers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gloomstalker) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#Gloomstalker "[[chapter 7]]")) at an increasingly fast rate. The characters must discover a way to repair and reseal the stone, destroy it, or banish it from [[Exandria]] before the city is overwhelmed.
