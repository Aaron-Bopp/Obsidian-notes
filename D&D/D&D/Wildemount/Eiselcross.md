Far north of the rest of Wildemount is a collection of imposing islands of ice, danger, and powerful, forgotten relics. Eiselcross and the Greying Wildlands are collectively known as the Biting North. For centuries, most of the world dismissed Eiselcross as an uninhabitable glacial land of blizzards and yetis. Only fishing vessels ever got close to the frozen shores â€” until one of those ships found an Aeorian item.

The flying city-state of Aeor, a place of inventors, magic, and progress, was hurled into Eiselcross by gods both good and evil during the Calamity. The Prime and Betrayer deities agreed on a momentary armistice to achieve this mammoth task, for Aeor's people crafted weapons made to kill the gods and had to be stopped. The gods tried to wholly destroy Aeor, but its protections against divine entities were carefully tuned and unexpectedly strong. It took the most of the pantheon to crash the city.

Aeor was long believed to have been obliterated, and the gods' silence on the matter only furthered this conviction, so the books of lore left nothing more to be studied or discussed on the once-powerful nation. However, recent discoveries of Aeorian artifacts revealed the truth of Aeor's resting place and spurred rumors of arcane secrets frozen beneath the ice of Eiselcross. Now Dwendalian, Uthodurnian, Xhorhasian, and mercenary expeditions search the hazardous terrain for materials that could change the tide of the war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty.

Map 3.7: Eiselcross

## Encounters in Eiselcross

Eiselcross is a land of strange magic, bizarre creatures, and fascinating people. Each day that the characters travel the land, roll a d20. On a result of 15 or higher, an encounter chosen or rolled on the Eiselcross Encounters table of the appropriate level occurs. Not all of these encounters are meant to result in combat, and the ideas on the tables can inspire encounters of your own creation.

d6

Encounter

1

The characters encounter 1d4 wildfolk [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout) hunting a [saber-toothed tiger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/saber-toothed-tiger). The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition.

2

The characters encounter a lost Cerberus Assembly [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage) trying to return to Balenpost. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of Aeor, and there is a 50 percent chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item.

3

The characters find a [griffon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/griffon) with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next 1d10 days.

An [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-dragon) ambushes the characters.

## Islands of Eiselcross

Eiselcross is a collection of eight icy islands, some of which have small, snow-covered mountain ranges:

**Beissel.** Eiselcross's third largest island is so far north that even prepared explorers have trouble surviving the cold. Most don't dare brave an expedition, and those who do turn back once they see the white dragons that rule Beissel.

**Dampfkan.** This island is an active volcano that steams into the sky. Dampfkan's few explorers have seen a large structure in the lava, but nobody knows what this mysterious monolith is.

**Foren.** The largest island of Eiselcross is also its most desirable destination for treasure-seekers, since Aeor's main crash site is on Foren.

**Frostbogen.** Given its proximity to Foren, one might think that this island is also a popular destination for explorers. But ever since a Cerberus Assembly delegation of over one hundred people, their ship, and all their belongings vanished during an expedition to Frostbogen, no one has dared to explore the island.

**Gelier.** Eiselcross's second-largest island holds the body of Quajath, the Undermaw, and its wormkin (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#TomboftheWorm "Tomb of the Worm")" later in this chapter).

**Kaltsel.** The smallest of Eiselcross's islands floats off the southeast coast of Foren and is said to be the home of Mynarc Furdahl, an undead warlock of Asmodeus willing to make deals in exchange for souls.

**Schneescel.** A permanent magical blizzard rages across Schneescel, a small island to the west of Foren, making it nigh impossible to explore. Many believe that a fallen Aeorian relic causes this storm.

**Taergoss.** Eiselcross's second smallest island is a favorite spot for fishing vessels to anchor overnight. The crews tend to stay on their boats and never set foot on shore, since faint wails can be heard at all times of day coming from Taergoss's center.

## Wildfolk of Eiselcross

While most of the world did not know about Eiselcross's secrets for centuries, the islands are home to nomadic clans of humans and halflings. These people move in small groups, following herds of elk and mammoths. They have no gods but instead revere the animals and natural phenomena such as the wind, snow, and waves. The wildfolk avoid Aeor's ruins and the terrible dangers that lurk there.

Eiselcross's wildfolk live simple, harsh lives. They hunt, gather, and support each other, taking shelter in tents made of furs. If they have disputes with one another, they reconcile or simply go separate ways. Taking the life of another Eiselcross native for any reason is an even greater transgression than murder normally is in the other areas of Wildemount. The penalty for such a crime is a facial branding in the shape of a knife and permanent exile from any wildfolk clan.

For all their peace with each other, the wildfolk of Eiselcross are fierce warriors. Their cold environment shapes them, and they must defend against saber-toothed tigers, yetis, and even more dangerous predators such as white dragons. The wildfolk tend to be distrustful of outsiders, especially after seeing explorers from across the sea going into locations the native people dare not enter and using arcane magic to uncover the frozen secrets of their land.

Aeor Crash Site

### Aeor Crash Site

While pieces of Aeor were thrown all over Eiselcross and the Frigid Depths, the city's main crash initially created a three-mile-diameter crater in the center of Foren. In the centuries since, ice covered the crater. Ruins poke through the frosty surface, creating tunnels, pits, and chasms. The buried ruins are filled with dangerous, wonderful creations and pockets of people frozen in time.

Most of Aeor's streets, buildings, and people were smashed to pieces when the city collided with Foren. Amid the ruins are magic fields of translucent blue force surrounding moments frozen in time. Many of these bubbles hold diverse crowds of humanoids huddled in the street, their bodies, clothes, belongings, and the ground itself unharmed by the crash. Others contain families holding hands as they brace for impact around dining tables, mages waving wands in the air around laboratory benches, soldiers with glowing swords raised to the sky, siege crews climbing atop weapons meant to fire massive projectiles, and more. Each magic field is a 10-foot-radius sphere, and nothing within appears damaged or moved by the crash.

While these preserved scenes are sometimes useful for gathering information, the items and people within are the real prize. Totally intact Aeorian technology is a rare find, but having even one of Aeor's inventors or mages to demonstrate, repair, and rebuild their creations is a reward beyond any of the other treasures the ruins hold. However, all attempts to dispel, break, or otherwise remove the impenetrable magic barriers have failed. The people within appear frozen in time, but no evidence suggests this stasis would change if the barriers dropped, or that the change would be for the better. Some say the barriers dropping could cause the creatures within to age rapidly, turn to dust, or go mad. Despite these warnings, explorers search Aeor's ruins for an item or spell that can break these bubbles.

_**Breaking the Bubbles.**_ If and how the stasis bubbles of Aeor can be broken is up to you, but here are a few suggestions for solutions:

-   An encoded ritual hidden in the bowels of Aeor's crash site can break the bubbles. It requires one powdered unicorn horn and one dried flumph tentacle per bubble.
-   The crystal in Allowak's Sanctuary powers the stasis bubbles. If it is destroyed, the stasis bubbles break.
-   In their exalted state, the Arms of the Betrayers (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-treasures#ArmsoftheBetrayers "chapter 6")) are powerful enough to break the bubbles with an attack.

#### Arms and Armor

Aeorian technology was created to battle the gods and their servants. Explorers seek weapons and armor, most of which is crafted to pierce divine defenses and guard against deific assaults. Weapons as small as daggers and as large as cannons were crafted in Aeor. Although much was destroyed in the crash, there are still items in the rubble (see [chapter 6](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-treasures "chapter 6")). The pieces are valuable, and the blueprints for creating such powerful items would be priceless, though none have been found so far.

A large facility in the city developed diseases meant to weaken and kill the gods and their servants. Aeor's mages tested the diseases on beasts and prisoners, creating horrific monsters, some of which still stalk the ruins.

_**Frigid Woe.**_ Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor's mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross's ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.

The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor's mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature's body. The infected creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature's speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.

A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.

Aeor's people didn't just develop weapons that could kill the gods; they created soldiers. Strange experiments turned captive beasts, prisoners, and volunteers into hulking dreadnoughts called Aeorian hunters (described inÂ [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#AeorianHunters "chapter 7")). Those that survived the crash still stalk the ruins, driven mad by isolation and unsated bloodlust.

A mile west of the crater that defines the crash site is a rocky hill that thaws any snow or ice that rests atop it. The mouth of a cavern can be found on the hill's northern side, which leads to a 60-foot-wide, domed chamber. In the center of this cave stands a fifteen-foot-tall obelisk made of dark, reflective metal that resembles smoothed obsidian. The stone quietly hums with an aura of abjuration from some mysterious enchantment. Travelers that complete a long rest within proximity of the stone are visited with terrible dreams of strange, alien places and visions difficult to understand.

The main reason for characters to explore Aeor's crash site is to uncover Aeorian magic items and other treasures, but any time spent in the region is sure to bring excitement and danger.

_**Wild Child (Mid Level).**_ An eight-year-old wildfolk child named Essora was playing with others near the crash site when a friend dared her to stand on the ice over the ruins. Essora fell through the ice and has not come out of the city's remains. None of the wildfolk are willing to risk themselves in the ruins to save Essora. The child's grandmother, Leriea, begs the characters to bring Essora home. While looking for a way out of the ruins, Essora found the enhancement workshop and drank a potion that gave her frigid woe. There is a vial of antidote deeper in the ruin.

_**Weapons of War (High Level).**_ The characters are hired by a representative of the Dwendalian Empire, the Kryn Dynasty, the Myriad, or some other faction to travel to the Aeor Crash Site and search for gold vials containing frigid woe, a milky liquid. A previous expedition found one such vial, and the characters' benefactors want more of it. The party's benefactor wants to keep the vials from falling into the wrong hands or wants to sell them to the highest bidder. To reach a hidden cache of vials in the depths of the crash site, the characters must content with Aeorian hunters (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#AeorianHunters "chapter 7")) and a rival search party of high-level adventurers.

### Allowak's Sanctuary

**Population:** 532 (100% yetis)

**Government:** Brightheart, the settlement's smartest and strongest abominable yeti, rules Allowak's Sanctuary as a dictator.

**Defense:** Every resident of Allowak's Sanctuary is capable of defending the settlement.

**Commerce:** Aside from trading for simple goods and services, there is no major commerce.

**Organizations:** The yetis have no organizational ties.

When Aeor fell into Foren, the impact threw a monolithic, purple crystal miles away from the crash site. The stone pierced the body of an abominable yeti named Allowak, but the crystal's magic preserved the yeti's corpse and absorbed Allowak's soul. When other yetis touched the crystal, their intellect increased and their innate desire to slaughter faded away. A society of the monstrosities living in huts and keeping mammoths for food sprung up around the crystal. These peaceful yetis abhor their more savage kin.

The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary keep their home a secret, for they worry that outsiders might try to steal the crystal. Although the crystal's effects seem permanent, the yetis fear that if it were removed from Allowak's remains, they would lose their newfound intelligence. If outsiders get close to the village, the yetis patrolling the village's borders approach and act like the more common and savage members of their species. The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary do not kill unless forced to, but they will cause injury to guard their secret.

In recent years, the yetis have acquired books and journals from explorers who died close to their camp. The tomes gave the yetis an understanding of the world beyond Eiselcross.

The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary are led by an abominable yeti named Brightheart. She organizes adventuring parties of her people to search Foren for more of their kin to awaken with the crystal. Brightheart claims this recruitment is to increase the size and security of the community, but some whisper that she is building an army to take over Eiselcross, and possibly even more places beyond the Frigid Depths.

The [yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti-allowak-variant) are [yetis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti) and [abominable yetis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti), with these changes:

-   Their alignments are neutral.
-   Each has an Intelligence score of 16 (+3) and a Charisma score of 10 (+0).
-   They can speak, read, and write Common and Yeti.

The characters could stumble across Allowak's Sanctuary or fight their way through the perimeter guards to uncover the village.

_**A Matter of Trust (Mid Level).**_ As the characters travel Foren, they find Dawnmind, a female Allowak [yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti-allowak-variant) (see "Allowak's Sanctuary Yeti Statistics") holding the tatters of a net as she lies in the snow, covered in claw wounds from others of her kind, with 1 hit point remaining. Three other yeti corpses, Dawnmind's companions, lie in the bloody snow nearby. Dawnmind begs the characters to escort her back to Allowak's Sanctuary along with the corpses. Her group failed to capture six wild yetis, but those yetis are nearby and stalk the characters if they help Dawnmind.

If the characters travel to Allowak's Sanctuary with Dawnmind, Brightheart welcomes them as heroes and thanks them with a place to stay, provided that they swear to keep Allowak's Sanctuary a secret â€” or the [abominable yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti) could order the characters to prove their loyalty by capturing a group of wild yetis or [mammoths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth) for her.

### Balenpost

**Population:** 205 (69% humans, 11% halflings, 7% gnomes, 7% dragonborn, 6% other races)

**Government:** Mages of the Cerberus Assembly, led by Wardlow Akron, run Balenpost.

**Defense:** A 10-foot-high wooden wall surrounds Balenpost. All the inhabitants are mages or adventurers capable of defending the outpost.

**Commerce:** The residents here are outfitted with all they need to survive by the Cerberus Assembly. Visitors can trade goods or services for lodging, rations, and other survival supplies.

**Organizations:** The Cerberus Assembly runs everything in the camp, but a few of King Bertrand Dwendal's spies are among the explorers' ranks.

A fort of frozen logs stands on the southwestern edge of Foren, housing intrepid explorers overseen by the Cerberus Assembly. Every waking moment of life in Balenpost is dedicated to planning and executing expeditions to uncover Aeorian items on the island. Lady Vess de Rogna (see "[Cerberus Assembly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#CerberusAssembly "Cerberus Assembly")" in chapter 2) appointed Wardlow Akron (lawful evil, male, human [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) to oversee day-to-day operations of the fort. The explorers say that Wardlow is harsher than the winds when it comes to rationing supplies and driving expeditions to go farther and faster in the hazardous tundra.

The expeditions that leave Balenpost are run by mages that work for the Cerberus Assembly. These mages and their crews are given honors, accolades, and special privileges, such as more rations, when they uncover Aeorian items. Teams that return to Balenpost to resupply have their wages docked until they return with a find.

Dwendalians with nothing to lose come to Balenpost to earn good pay, but many of the other explorers are prisoners quietly approached by the Cerberus Assembly and offered freedom in exchange for service. Prisoners that don't contribute to the expeditions are sent back to the mainland in chains, so many are willing to cheat, steal from, or kill other crews.

Balenpost is not just a place of discovery but also one of arcane experimentation. Wardlow Akron placed Korberta Horswell (chaotic neutral, female, rock gnome [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) in charge of the team that studies and tries to duplicate Aeorian items retrieved from the wilds of Eiselcross. The reckless mage and her team perform all manner of experiments to recreate items brought back from the wastes. These tests often go dangerously awry. Death and magical destruction are not uncommon results, and a few items have warped or twisted subjects into horrible monstrosities that are locked away somewhere secret in the lab.

While the Cerberus Assembly is in charge of exploring Eiselcross, the Crown wants to make sure its interests are protected. The assembly reports enough discoveries to King Bertrand to make it seem like the sovereign is informed, but he knows better. King Bertrand planted spies among the explorers because he doesn't want the assembly keeping the most powerful Aeorian items secret, lest they be used to overthrow him. The leader of this spy ring is Karta Meck, a neutral human spy who also happens to be one of the camp's most accomplished treasure hunters.

Wardlow suspects that the king planted spies in Balenpost and regularly tries to read the minds of explorers and look at communications sent out of the camp to find the king's agents. His attempts thus far have proven fruitless.

New supplies, letters, and people come to Balenpost from Icehaven by boat every month. These ships then take people and missives from Eiselcross back to the mainland of Wildemount. The journey through the Frigid Depths is perilous and can delay or destroy a resupply boat, an event which forces the outpost to restrict rations.

The main reason for many characters to come to Balenpost is to seek out Aeorian items for themselves or the Cerberus Assembly.

_**Conviction (Low Level).**_ Nathrow Arple (neutral evil, male, stout halfling [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)), a former enforcer for the Myriad, came to Balenpost with his old crew of four [thugs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thug). The group was captured fifteen years ago during the raid on the Myriad's central facility in Yrrosa. Nathrow got his imprisoned crew on the same exploration team, then they murdered their Cerberus Assembly leader and made off into the wilds of Eiselcross, looking to steal a fishing vessel. Wardlow Akron offers the characters 100 gp to hunt down the criminals and throws in a [gem of brightness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/gem-of-brightness) if the characters bring back Nathrow alive (so the assembly can make an example of him). If the characters brave the dangers of Eiselcross and catch up to the criminals, Nathrow offers them anything within his power to avoid arrest and turns to combat if all else fails.

_**Cold as Ice (High Level).**_ An entire team of explorers was torn apart in the wastes just outside Balenpost. The tracks nearby indicate that only humanoids were involved in the struggle. Agents of the Dwendalian royal family send the characters to investigate, suspecting that one of the other teams ambushed the victims. Wardlow Akron is loath to cooperate with the characters since they are sent by the empire, and because he knows the responsibility for the attacks lies partly on his shoulders. The person behind the attacks is Mera Vacross, a female human transformed into a [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) by one of Korberta Horswell's experiments. The vampire escaped the lab and makes her home in a cave just outside Balenpost. If the characters take care of the vampire, Wardlow tries to bribe or threaten the characters to keep quiet about the monster's origins.

_**Spy Hunters (Any Level).**_ The Cerberus Assembly learns that King Dwendal's [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy) have infiltrated Balenpost. They hire the characters to find and report the spies to Wardlow Akron. The characters might uncover Karta Meck's network of four spies within the camp or find a lead-lined box among Karta's supplies which holds a [sending stone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stones) paired with another held by Oliver Schreiber (see "[Dwendalian Empire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DwendalianEmpire "Dwendalian Empire")" in chapter 2). If discovered, the spies attempt to win over the characters, promising an Aeorian item in exchange for helping to discover what secrets are hidden in Horswell's lab.

White dragons scour the islands of Eiselcross for food and treasure

### Fortress of the Dead Jarl

From the outside, the Fortress of the Dead Jarl is an enormous fairy-tale castle made entirely of ice. The horrors inside the place tell a different story. The frost giant leader, Jarl Conessa Berg, was obsessed with gathering objects from Aeor. Two centuries ago, one of those items turned Conessa and every giant within her castle into an undead zombie. These beings are trapped inside the castle along with a hoard of Aeorian items.

The Aeorian items within the fortress are enough to tempt most adventurers, but there are other reasons to go to the fortress.

_**They're Free (Mid Level).**_ When the characters arrive in Balenpost or Syrinlya, a [frost giant zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-giant-zombie) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#FrostGiantZombie "chapter 7")) attacks the camp. If the characters help defeat the giant, the leader of the camp tells the characters it is the third attack in as many days and asks them to find the source of the zombies. Characters can track the zombies back to the fortress. Each day the characters follow this path, roll any die. On an even result, the characters encounter 1d4 frost giant zombies. When they reach the fortress, they find that one of the walls is breached and must repair it to stop the zombies from leaving the castle. This breach could be natural or could be caused by a faction with a score to settle against the attacked outpost.

### Mutalos

In the northern part of Foren, a strange patch of wilderness exactly 30 miles in diameter is avoided by the wildfolk at all costs. They call this region Mutalos. Every morning at dawn, the area's environment suddenly changes. Mutalos shifts from desert to forest, from mountainous to swamp, or from any one habitat to another without any discernible pattern. The area can even be a seemingly normal icy tundra, so unsuspecting explorers traveling through Mutalos could suddenly find themselves in the middle of the sea when the sun rises.

The origins of these environmental changes are unknown, but scholars believe an Aeorian object fell from the city and created the region. All Wildemount's factions are interested in an item of such incredible transmutation power.

When the environment of Mutalos changes, so do its inhabitants. At dawn, a mountainous region filled with kobolds, goats, and ogres might become a swamp inhabited by lizardfolk, rats, and yuan-ti. It is unknown where exactly these creatures come from and where they go when the regions change. They could be transported from other places in Exandria, teleported from elsewhere in the multiverse, or created and destroyed by this strange magic. It is also unknown if the same creatures reappear with the same habitats or if the creatures are always new to Mutalos. The origin of the region's changes likely holds the answers to these questions.

Sometimes a creature that appears in Mutalos leaves the borders of the region. When this occurs, the creature becomes untethered from the magic that brought it to Foren and remains in Eiselcross even after Mutalos's environment changes. Many creatures from other habitats don't last for long in the arctic wastes, but a few are smart or strong enough to survive.

Each day at dawn, the habitat of Mutalos changes. You can choose or roll this new environment on the Mutalos Habitats table. If you roll the result of Mutalos's current environment, roll again until you get a new result.

Trying to find the origin of Mutalos's magic or simply traveling through the region is an adventure, but there are other reasons to explore the area.

_**Lost Staff (High Level).**_ Farrhan Yost (lawful evil, female, human [archmage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage)) was a part of the initial Cerberus Assembly team that explored Eiselcross. Now back on the mainland, she tells the characters she lost her [staff of power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-power) in Mutalos when the region was an ocean habitat, hoping it tempts them into exploring the region to find her old staff. As the characters search, she uses the [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying) spell to keep tabs on them. Should the characters discover her staff or any other interesting treasures, Farrhan teleports to their location with her shield guardian and offers a meager payment for the find. If the characters refuse, she attacks. Farrhan intends to get her staff back no matter what and wants to claim the characters' discoveries as her own.

### River Inferno

This odd, mile-wide river of lava flows south-to-north across the length of Foren. The River Inferno disappears at both its ends into the sea, springing up seemingly from nowhere. Most scholars believe that the river was created by the crash of Aeor, though this theory has yet to be confirmed. It is clear that the river has ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire, for fire elementals, magma mephits, and salamanders can be occasionally found along its banks.

The River Inferno's lava has the destructive power one expects, though there is an exception: ice and snow that fall into the lava remain intact. Bold explorers traveling north sometimes ride the river's floating icebergs to get to their destinations more quickly. The river flows at an impressive rate of seven miles per hour.

The river itself is best avoided, but characters can have interesting encounters if they follow it.

_**Haughty Efreet (High Level).**_ A pair of [efreet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/efreeti) recently emerged from the River Inferno, and the characters are the first intelligent creatures they find. Using [tongues](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/tongues) spells, the efreet demand that the characters tell them everything they know about this strange land, then demand that the characters point them in the direction of the nearest settlement. The efreet plan to enslave the settlement's inhabitants and put them to work building an obsidian tower on the shore of the River Inferno, where the efreet can stay whenever they deign to visit this dismally cold corner of the multiverse.

### Syrinlya

**Population:** 182 (72% dwarves, 24% elves, 4% other races)

**Government:** Professor Gulrim Shalebrow is in charge of Syrinlya, appointed to run the outpost by Queen Fruunast of Uthodurn.

**Defense:** Syrinlya's inhabitants are explorers capable of defending the settlement.

**Commerce:** Syrinlya's explorers are willing to trade for meager belongings. Aoerian items can be sold to the Buyer (see "The Buyer's Hut" below).

**Organizations:** Elves, dwarves, and a few others from Uthodurn are the only residents of Syrinlya. Most have no organizational ties.

Syrinlya is a collection of yurts filled with mercenary explorers from Uthodurn looking to get rich. Professor Gulrim Shalebrow (see "[Diarchy of Uthodurn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DiarchyofUthodurn "Diarchy of Uthodurn")" in chapter 2) runs this outpost with few rules: just an unspoken agreement that all explorers have each other's backs against the harsh environment, just as they would back in their mountain home.

#### A Lawless, Moral Land

Syrinlya has few laws, but its explorers look out for each other. This is a courtesy they learned at home in Uthodurn, where the dwarves and elves are interdependent. Most folks in Syrinlya share food when their hunts are good so that others return the favor when their luck runs out.

Syrinlya doesn't suffer bullies. The honor system is enforced by the toughest explorers, who don't hesitate to take justice into their own hands. One such individual is the dwarf Morgo Delwur (neutral good, male [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werebear)), a staunch friend and an even more staunch holder of grudges. Gulgrim is content to allow the explorers to keep order, as it saves him from having to govern and allows him to go off on expeditions of his own.

The largest yurt in the outpost is occupied by an elf called the Buyer (lawful neutral, nonbinary, high elf [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)). The Buyer was brought to Eiselcross by Professor Gulgrim Shalebrow to run the day-to-day operations of the camp while the dwarf explores. The Buyer keeps to themselves and refuses to share their real name, which is Elloway Tenvidas. When the Buyer acquires an object, they place the item into a large stone chest, which transports the object back to Uthodurn or Palebank Village. Some of the explorers think the chest could also be used to transport people, but none are brave enough to ask the mysterious Buyer or risk experimenting with the chest themselves.

The main reason for many characters to come to Syrinlya is to seek out Aoerian items for Uthodurn, but there are plenty of other adventures to be had in the outpost.

_**The Arcane Tree (Mid Level).**_ While the characters are in Syrinlya, Morgo Delwur returns from an expedition with a bag of five green seeds from one of Eiselcross's Aeorian ruins. The [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werebear) lost a seed in the snow when showing them off, and a 15-foot-tall, green tree springs up overnight in the middle of the camp. Whenever a creature casts a spell that restores hit points or deals radiant damage to another creature within 90 feet of the tree, the tree uproots itself from the ground and attacks the creature. After killing the spellcasting creature and other threats, the tree replants its roots. Every 1d10 days the tree remains rooted, a new tree of the same type grows up from the ground within 30 feet. If the trees become a problem, Professor Gulgrim Shalebrow asks the characters to deal with them.

The [animated tree](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/animated-tree) uses the [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) stat block, with these changes:

-   It is unaligned.
-   It has resistance against necrotic damage and radiant damage.
-   It understands Common, Druidic, Elvish, and Sylvan but cannot speak.

### Tomb of the Worm

**Population:** 345 (83% humans, 17% halflings)

**Government:** Quajath commands the settlement's inhabitants telepathically, though a cult fanatic named Galgonos serves as the Tomb of the Worm's leader for day-to-day operations.

**Defense:** All adult inhabitants in the Tomb of the Worm are capable combatants.

**Commerce:** The Tomb of the Worm has no commerce, though Quajath's meat is offered freely to travelers.

**Organizations:** The wildfolk that live here serve only Quajath, but they are friendly toward explorers from the Kryn Dynasty.

Three decades ago, a clan of wildfolk on Gelier found the exposed body of Quajath the Undermaw poking through the wall of an icy cave (see "[Lesser Idols](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-wildemount#LesserIdols "Lesser Idols")" in chapter 1). These accessible sections of the worm peek through the cave's ceiling and walls, and are still attached to the worm. The wildfolk who discovered this place consumed the Undermaw's exposed meat and found that it regrew. They now live in the cave, enjoying the easy, renewable source of food, and are now fully under the sway of the Undermaw. They invite others to join them, calling themselves wormkin.

The people living in the Tomb of the Worm work together in harmony. Galgonos (chaotic neutral, male, human [cult fanatic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cult-fanatic) with the wormkin template described below) is the leader of the settlement, and he organizes parties of wormkin that search Gelier and the rest of Eiselcross for more wildfolk to join their ranks. Outsiders often find the settlement charming because of how well the villagers get along, though a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check can tell that the wormkin are more dangerous than they appear. The villagers offer the Undermaw's meat to visitors and force-feed it to those who refuse but would make worthy additions to the Undermaw's army.

The wormkin have two goals: grow their numbers and free Quajath from the ice. What Quajath plans to have its followers do once it leaves the ice is known only to the Undermaw.

Tomb of the Worm

Humanoids that consume the Undermaw's flesh ten or fewer days after it has been removed from Quajath must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become wormkin 1d6 hours later. Wormkin can be identified by the black veins that cover their appendages and neck. Characters who become wormkin might become NPCs at the DM's discretion. A [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration) spell or similar magic removes all the wormkin features from a creature, restoring it to its original state. Wormkin gain the following features:

**Alignment.** The creature's alignment becomes chaotic neutral.

**Connected to Quajath.** No matter where the creature is, Quajath can read the creature's every thought and memory and speak with the creature telepathically. Quajath can also access the creature's senses and perceive what the creature perceives. As a bonus action, Quajath can take direct control of the creature, choosing the actions, bonus action, reactions, and movement the creature takes until Quajath ends this control as a bonus action.

**Magic Resistance.** The creature has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** If the creature has at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn.

The characters might find adventure, allies, and adversaries in the Tomb of the Worm.

_**Meat Thieves (Low Level).**_ As the characters explore Gelier, they cross paths with a group of four wildfolk commoners led by Jarinmine (chaotic good, female, lightfoot halfling [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout)). The halfling begs them to take a 300-pound package of meat to the sea and dump it in the icy water. She warns the characters not to eat it and offers them her ivory necklace (worth 100 gp) if they agree to the task. If pressed, she says the meat is tainted and that it turns people into slaves for Galgonos. Jarinmine stole the meat from the wormkin because she believes the diet poisons their minds. She needs to get back to the Tomb of the Worm before Galgonos realizes what she's done.

Before the characters reach the sea, six wormkin catch up to them. Their leader is Redjaw (chaotic neutral, female, human [cult fanatic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cult-fanatic)), and the others are cultists, all with the wormkin template applied. Redjaw demands that the characters give back the food that was stolen and forces a fight if the characters refuse. If the characters return the meat, Redjaw invites them back to the Tomb of the Worm. If the characters go to the village, they find that Jarinmine and her friends have been captured by the wormkin and are about to be executed for their crimes.

### Vurmas

**Population:** 193 (51% dark elves, 23% orcs, 14% gnolls, 12% other races)

**Government:** Captain Hallwas Denalor has authority over this floating outpost, but Norca Brighttusk leads the expeditions.

**Defense:** Every inhabitant is an experienced explorer capable of defending the outpost.

**Commerce:** The outpost has no official economy, but people might be willing to trade for goods or services.

**Organizations:** The people of Vurmas are not associated with any organizations beyond the Kryn Dynasty.

Vurmas is a floating outpost for the Kryn Dynasty near the north shore of Gelier, and the dynasty keeps Vurmas secret from other factions. The Kryn established this base near Eiselcross's second-largest island not to find Aeorian items but to make allies of Eiselcross's wildfolk.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-20.png)

Vurmas

Vurmas is not a true settlement: it's actually three sailing ships tied together and anchored near the north shore of Gelier. These boats are the _New Radiance_, the _Candlefire_, and the _Soulsailor_. At any given moment, one of the ships could be traveling to Xhorhas with a hold full of new Luxon-worshiping wildfolk converts or on the way back to Eiselcross with more supplies.

The Kryn's explorers stay on the boats when they can, bringing supplies to shore when they go out in search of allies. These ships are maintained and run by Captain Hallwas Denalor (lawful neutral, female, dark elf [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran)), while Norca Brighttusk (neutral, female, orc [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest)) leads the expedition teams.

The Kryn Dynasty believes that the wildfolk of Eiselcross are a better find and more reliable than most Aeorian objects, especially since the items tend to interfere with the Kryn's divine magic. With the Cerberus Assembly and the Uthodurnians busy in Foren, the Kryn stay clear of the largest island and search for allies in the rest of Eiselcross's lands. Many wildfolk are easy converts of the Luxon since they respect divine magic but do not worship any deity.

The Kryn approach each wildfolk clan with caution and kindness, healing the sick and injured while preaching the faith of the Luxon. They take only willing wildfolk away from the clan, knowing many others will follow because they miss their friends and family.

Choosing the waters near Gelier as a base of operations was no accident. This island is home to the wormkin, wildfolk that devour the frozen form of Quajath (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#TomboftheWorm "Tomb of the Worm")" earlier in this chapter). These wildfolk have strange minds, but they display regenerative abilities because of their diet. Norca Brighttusk regularly preaches to the wormkin, telling them that the beast they feed on is a creation of the Luxon. The wormkin have agreed to convert and join the Kryn once Quajath is freed from the ice â€” an effort that is already underway. If the Undermaw and its people can be turned toward the light of the Luxon, the Kryn Dynasty will have gained a considerable advantage in its war against the Dwendalian Empire. None of the Kryn, not even Norca Brighttusk, knows that Quajath has no intention of serving anyone and that the wormkin are completely under its sway.

The main reason for characters allied with the Kryn Dynasty to come to Vurmas is to join Norca Brighttusk's recruitment efforts, but there are plenty of other adventures to be had in the area.

_**Keep Us Secret (Low Level).**_ Kryn spies report that the _Bold Adventurer_, a scouting ship from the Dwendalian Empire, is planning to visit the island of Gelier, near Vurmas. Captain Hallwas Denalor and Norca Brighttusk don't want the _Bold Adventurer_'s crew to see Vurmas or reach Gelier, ensuring that the Kryn's operation in Eiselcross and the settlement of the wormkin remain secret. The pair offer the characters 500 gp to stop the _Bold Adventurer_'s approach. The _Bold Adventurer_ is a keelboat (see the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table in [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#AirborneandWaterborneVehicles "chapter 5") of the [Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide")) that carries six [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout). The captain of the Bold Adventurer, Sally Brizzberm, has a [sending stone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stone) that she uses to communicate with the captain of a Dwendalian warship called the _Bright Queenâ€™s Doom_. If her ship is attacked, Sally uses the stone to send a warning to the warship, which might threaten Vurmas in the future.

_**Save Our Ships (Mid Level).**_ While the characters are aboard one of Vurmas's boats, three wildfolk [druids](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid), each riding on the back of a [killer whale](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/killer-whale), attack the boats. The druids are angry that wildfolk are leaving Eiselcross in droves to go to Xhorhas. They believe that the Kryn are using enchantment magic against these wildfolk, tricking them into leaving their friends and family. The druids use hit-and-run tactics, dealing as much damage as possible before fleeing. Captain Hallwas Denalor asks the characters to deal with the attackers. The druids could be open to negotiation, or they might fight with their dying breath for their beliefs.
