### Palebank Village

**Population:** 690 (61% [[dwarves]], 32% [[elves]], 3% [[gnomes]], 4% other races)

**Government:** The [[Elves|elf]] ranger Elro Aldataur is the appointed leader of the village. He delegates tasks to proven friends and trustworthy allies.

**Defense:** Elro commands a small force of errant Glassblades. Some civilians are willing to take up arms to defend the city in moments of crisis.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies can be purchased or traded at the small inns or supply shacks.

**Organizations:** There are two humble temples to [[Moradin]] and [[Corellon]], respectively. [[Uthodurn]] governs from afar, while the Tribes of Shadycreek send agents to seek more information about [[Eiselcross]].

Along the cold shore of the Frigid Depths, Palebank Village marks the first surviving [[Uthodurn]] outpost beyond the mountains. The settlement is situated against the low cliff boundary of the [[Crystalsands Tundra]], just north of the [[Flotket Alps]]. The denizens of Palebank often take to ice fishing, trapping, or hunting, returning in small caravans to Uthodurn to sell their wares and restock their supplies. Territorial monsters wander close to the village, so rotating squads of Glassblades are assigned to protect the people. The small docks have been recently expanded to accommodate the increased interest in heading northwest toward [[Eiselcross]]. Palebank has become a launching point for northern expeditions, leading to growing trade and a pressing need for more inns.

The village is guided by Elro Aldataur, a weathered [[Elves|elf]] ranger who helped found Palebank roughly sixty years ago. Stoic and humorless, Elro showed a knack for leadership when the fledgling outpost was beset with danger on a near-constant basis. Elro earned the trust and respect of the residents, and they asked him to govern Palebank. He begrudgingly accepted, and has since overseen the expansion and protection of the village. Elro generally has sixty to ninety Glassblades at his command.

The people of Palebank must work together to survive in this frigid land, and there is little room in the small community to conduct any worthwhile larceny or immoral activity. What crimes do occur are born out of necessity and punished accordingly by Elro.

Surrounded by four watchtowers and a ten-foot-tall palisade of sharpened logs, Palebank is a ramshackle village locked in eternal winter. The village is made up of over a hundred cabins and shacks. It's too small to have distinct neighborhoods, so most businesses and residences were established wherever they could fit at the time, creating a meandering layout. Off the northern cliff, about fifteen feet down to the sand-and-snow beach, the docks hold around a dozen ships, ranging from fishing vessels to small cargo ships that carry expeditions to and from [[Eiselcross]].

Palebank Village would be a sleepy place without much excitement were it not for the presence of eager explorers and the settlement's importance as a waystation between [[Uthodurn]] and the [[islands of Eiselcross]].

_**Troll Night (Mid Level).**_ While the characters stay in Palebank Village, the only survivor of an unlucky Glassblades patrol staggers into the village. An organized band of [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) is coming down from the [[Flotket Alps]] toward the settlement, which needs every able-bodied warrior to keep the trolls at bay. How did these trolls get so organized, and what do they seek in the village?
