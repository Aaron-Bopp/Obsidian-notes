### Uraliss

The small town of Uraliss was [[Uthodurn]]'s first attempt to expand beyond its mountain halls. Uraliss was settled with the intent of becoming a farming village to aid in crop production. As the town began construction, arcane wards were developed and placed along a patch of snow-covered field at the base of the [[Flotket Alps]]. The wards were designed to slowly melt the snow and hopefully help develop the area into farmable land. However, the town was beset by orcs and other threats from the [[Rime Plains]], and the town's hopes were further crushed when the land beneath the snow was found to be rocky and untillable. The settlement was quickly abandoned and is now a crumbling ghost town left to be vandalized and repurposed by the [[Boroftkrah]] orcs of the Rime Plains.

Characters might go to Uraliss to retrieve something left behind, study its arcane wards, or hunt a beast that lurks in the ghost town.

_**Haunted Temple of the All-Hammer (Low Level).**_ The [[Boroftkrah]] orcs avoid Uraliss's temple of [[Moradin]] at all costs. The temple is filled with specters of dwarves and elves captured by a high priest who went mad and locked her congregation in the temple during the final orc raid. All her victims starved to death, as did the priest herself, who became a [wraith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/wraith). The characters could come to this building to find a lost treasure of Moradin, or to escape other threats as they pass through the ruined town.
