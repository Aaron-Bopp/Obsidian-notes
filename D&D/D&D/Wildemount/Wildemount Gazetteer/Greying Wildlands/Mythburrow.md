**Location**:: [[Greying Wildlands]]
In the farthest reaches of the northeast [[Greying Wildlands]], tucked low near the base of the [[Flotket Alps]], the ominous, icicle-wreathed mouth of a deep mountain cavern plunges into the heart of the rocky range. The locals who call this place Mythburrow tell stories of a monstrous, ancient being that claims dominion over the surrounding lands. Tales of a bellowing roar that shakes the valley have been told for centuries, and some even claim to have seen the frightful wingspan of the immense white-scaled [[dragon]] that calls Mythburrow home. While many joke about the siren call of a [[dragon]]'s hoard, few have the mettle to venture into this cavern in search of wealth and glory â€” and those who did enter the cave never returned.

Deep within the Mythburrow, something old and terrible shifts in seclusion, plotting its next hunt in the lands above.
