### Kravaraad

Black, burning, and defiant against the frost and cold of the north, the volcano of Kravaraad looms in the heart of the Flotket Alps. Perpetual streaks of dark smoke rise up to blend with heavy steam from the trails of molten rock that cool against the surrounding ice. The mountain is known for a continuous, gradual flow of glowing lava from multiple vents, but massive eruptions are extremely rare. The heat of the lava allows a pair of adjacent freshwater lakes, known as the Mistpools, to provide liquid water year-round. Its dramatic presence among the pale, snow-powdered trails of the Flotkets makes Kravaraad an important landmark for travelers in the snowy region. Hardier creatures live in the surrounding snowmelt, often competing for territory against the fire giants who claim the northern side and interior of the volcano. Many such battles echo through the mountains like distant thunder, calling other denizens to come witness the struggle, or to wait and finish off the survivors.

The volcano attracts creatures dangerous enough to make traveling near Kravaraad an adventure of its own.

_**Vault of the Fire Giants (High Level).**_ Kravaraad's [fire giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-giant) have greedily amassed treasure since the time before the Calamity. To reach their subterranean vault, the characters must sneak by or carve through the latest creatures who have challenged the fire giants (often [frost giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-giant) or other creatures that can endure the cold). But making it to the fire giants is only half the battle. The fire giants have hewn a vast dungeon under the mountain, and characters must navigate its perils while maintaining their balance whenever Kravaraad causes the entire complex to tremble. The vault itself is guarded by an enslaved [adult red dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-red-dragon) that longs to be free.
