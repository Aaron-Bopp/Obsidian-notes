**Location**:: [[Greying Wildlands]]

Dominating the central region between the [[Crystalsands Tundra]] and the [[Rime Plains]], the range of mountains known as the Flotket Alps is a majestic, snow-covered land of scattered pine trees and rough slopes that rise to dizzyingly sharp peaks. Nomadic trolls and roving wyverns claim the caves and alcoves of the mountainsides, hunting other inhabitants who've also adapted to the arctic weather. This alpine expanse is often battered by harsh blizzards, pushing some denizens underground into the maze of ice caverns that wind throughout the range, abandoned by some long-forgotten society and turned into the home of several warring frost giant clans. Among the natural chaos of the alps, the subterranean city of [[Uthodurn]] and its people seek to tame the wild crags around them and spread beyond the boundaries of this frozen highland.

Icy spires and snowy paths wind though these mountains, leading travelers who survive the Alps to new challenges and rewards.
