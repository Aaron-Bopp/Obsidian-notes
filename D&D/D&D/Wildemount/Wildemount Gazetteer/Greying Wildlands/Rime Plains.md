### Rime Plains

These fields of rolling tundra and bursts of boreal forest stretch on and on, covering the southeastern [[Greying Wildlands]]. Wild muskox and snow foxes wander across the rocky grassland, as wolves, saber-toothed tigers, and other beasts hunt to survive the freezing nights. [[Humans]] have not yet encroached on this region, and the people of [[Uthodurn]] abandoned their expansion into the plains, so wayfaring [[orcs]] and goblinoid bands have claimed areas of the region unchallenged. The Rime Plains are a mostly open, untamed wilderness where survival depends on one's ability to endure the elements and navigate the wilds skillfully.

While the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] managed to temper their fury through their worship of the Storm Lord, a number of their kin embraced their violent past and abandoned the rest to seek greater conquests. Now known as the Jez-Araz, or "Breakers of Spirits," these violent [[orcs]] live in scattered, nomadic groups that hunt around the plains and the lower [[Flotket Alps]]. Praising [[Gruumsh]] through acts of brutality, the Jez-Araz hunting parties are a fearsome sight for any wanderer to behold.
