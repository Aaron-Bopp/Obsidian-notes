After the orc's creator god [[Gruumsh]] was banished in the [[Divergence]], many of the war clans of his bloody army fled and went into hiding. Splintered from the same throng of Odakar [[orcs]] that held the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], the leaderless droves migrated northward to the [[Rime Plains]]. Although they were severed from the direct influence of the Ruiner, the directionless [[orcs]] began to succumb to the Ruiner's "gift" of bloodlust. A schism tore the clans asunder, and from the bloodshed emerged a new clan of orcish marauders known as the Jez-Araz.

The remaining champions of the Odakar clan, determined to survive, found inspiration in [[Kord]] they had once fought against. They formed an organized clan of warrior [[orcs]] who seek to overcome the Ruiner's murderous influence and find strength within themselves. From this new path, the Boroftkrah orc clan and the settlement of Boroftkrah was born, creating a strong community that values deeds done in service to the clan. The [[orcs]] of Boroftkrah wander the surrounding plains in heavy furs and leathers, seeking ways to commune with [[Kord]] through challenges of survival and contests of hunting and tracking skill. While the clan is overwhelmingly of orcish descent, on rare occasions they welcome outsiders who prove themselves strong in the eyes of [[Kord]].

Like many of their southern brethren, the [[orcs]] of Boroftkrah continue to eschew the hunger for violence that [[Gruumsh]] supposedly instilled in the orcish people when he created them. They take pride in victory and the success of the hunt, making great offerings of powerful prey to the Storm Lord. They channel their desire for war into battling the harsh lands that surround them to ensure the survival of their community. While most Boroftkrah [[orcs]] choose to shed their shackles of murderous rage, they remain territorial, often fighting their ferocious Jez-Araz cousins or coming into conflict with hunting parties from [[Uthodurn]].

The settlement is guided by a circle of elder warriors who have proven themselves the strongest and most dedicated to the survival of the clan. If the circle has a vacancy, volunteers prove their worthiness in a series of contests before the central idol of [[Kord]], ending with a rune-casting ceremony that invokes [[Kord]]'s will toward who will become an elder warrior. Under these elder warriors, all others are equal and trained to take up arms if the settlement is in danger.

Crime is not common within Boroftkrah. A strong sense of honor often prevents the urge for criminal activity. It is rare for anyone within the clan to steal or take from others, unless both parties agree to a challenge to see who is worthy. Those that do steal are shamed as unworthy and exiled from the clan to wander the [[Greying Wildlands]] alone.

The settlement of Boroftkrah is a loose collection of tents and shelters surrounded by a tall fence of wooden pikes. The town is created to be mobile if serious danger threatens its current location. Neighborhoods are formed in large circles of homesteads called lods. Giant boars and powerful worgs of the plains are trained as mounts and kept in scattered holding pens.

Navigating Boroftkrah is its own adventure. To gain the trust of the [[orcs]], the characters must prove themselves in contests of strength.
