**Defense**:: The vast majority of the occupants are frontline soldiers and deadly combatants. Mobile siege engines stand at the ready.

**Organizations**:: The outpost is currently held by the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. Temporary shrines to [[the Luxon]] have been installed.

The Ashguard Garrison is the partner fortress to the newer [[Rockguard Garrison]], and the two strongholds flank the city of [[Bladegarden]]. On the south side of the [[Brokenveil Bluffs]], Ashguard sits atop a steep mountain pass that slides into the [[Brokenveil Marsh]] of [[Xhorhas]], making it near impossible to assault from the front. Although the garrison successfully repelled the dangers beyond for many years, it fell to a series of clever assaults from the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] â€” they used magic to darken the sky and cause confusion while their forces burrowed beneath the battlements. Over a thousand Dwendalian soldiers were slain, and the army was pushed back to [[Bladegarden]].

Now occupied by the forces of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], this garrison has been refitted to defend against the very people who built it, its walls darkened by the shadows of perpetual twilight.

If the characters are at Ashguard Garrison, they're likely either reclaiming the garrison for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] or working for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] on the front lines of the war.
