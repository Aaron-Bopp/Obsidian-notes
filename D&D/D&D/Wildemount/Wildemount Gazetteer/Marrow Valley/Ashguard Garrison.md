### Ashguard Garrison

**Population:** 5,720 (74% [[Dark Elves]], 26% other races)

**Government:** The garrison is currently helmed by the acting general of the Kryn forces holding the stronghold.

**Defense:** The vast majority of the occupants are frontline soldiers and deadly combatants. Mobile siege engines stand at the ready.

**Commerce:** Beyond the rations needed to survive and small-scale trade between the soldiers, little commerce is available.

**Organizations:** The outpost is currently held by the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. Temporary shrines to [[the Luxon]] have been installed.

The Ashguard Garrison is the partner fortress to the newer [[Rockguard Garrison]], and the two strongholds flank the city of [[Bladegarden]]. On the south side of the [[Brokenveil Bluffs]], Ashguard sits atop a steep mountain pass that slides into the [[Brokenveil Marsh]] of [[Xhorhas]], making it near impossible to assault from the front. Although the garrison successfully repelled the dangers beyond for many years, it fell to a series of clever assaults from the Kryn â€” they used magic to darken the sky and cause confusion while their forces burrowed beneath the battlements. Over a thousand Dwendalian soldiers were slain, and the army was pushed back to [[Bladegarden]].

Now occupied by the forces of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], this garrison has been refitted to defend against the very people who built it, its walls darkened by the shadows of perpetual twilight.

If the characters are at Ashguard Garrison, they're likely either reclaiming the garrison for the empire or working for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] on the front lines of the war.

_**Take Back Ashguard Garrison (Mid Level).**_ The characters are tasked with taking back the stronghold for the empire. Since a direct assault on the stronghold would likely end in the characters' demise, they are encouraged to use magical disguises, infiltrate the outpost, and form a strategy over a period of months while they gather intelligence. During this time, the characters might learn that the [[Kryn Dynasty]] isn't the evil threat it was made out to be, prompting them to question their loyalties.
