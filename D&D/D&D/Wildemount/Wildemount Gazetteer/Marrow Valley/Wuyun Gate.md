### Wuyun Gate
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley
**Location**:: [[Marrow Valley]]

The southernmost boundary of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the Wuyun Gate rests within the [[Wuyun Gorge]] where the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] meet the [[Cyrios Mountains]]. This imposing gate stands roughly twenty feet tall and fifteen feet wide, opening when passage is given to travelers seeking to enter or exit the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. A wall of stone twenty-five feet tall continues from each side of the gate, stretching to meet the nearby mountains. These walls are topped by patrolling [[Crownsguard]] whose weapons are always at the ready. Originally built as a military fortification to prevent the [[Clovis Concord]] from assaulting the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], it now acts as a waypoint on the trade route, and occasionally as a Righteous Brand outpost when dangerous creatures begin to wander too far from the nearby mountain ranges.

The characters could help defend the Wuyun Gate outpost when monsters attack and hold the gate until reinforcements arrive, or they could reclaim the gate for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] after it falls.
