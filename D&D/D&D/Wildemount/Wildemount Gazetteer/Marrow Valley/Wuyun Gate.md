### Wuyun Gate

The southernmost boundary of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the Wuyun Gate rests within the [[Wuyun Gorge]] where the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] meet the [[Cyrios Mountains]]. This imposing gate stands roughly twenty feet tall and fifteen feet wide, opening when passage is given to travelers seeking to enter or exit the empire. A wall of stone twenty-five feet tall continues from each side of the gate, stretching to meet the nearby mountains. These walls are topped by patrolling Crownsguard whose weapons are always at the ready. Originally built as a military fortification to prevent the [[Clovis Concord]] from assaulting the empire, it now acts as a waypoint on the trade route, and occasionally as a Righteous Brand outpost when dangerous creatures begin to wander too far from the nearby mountain ranges.

The characters could help defend the Wuyun Gate outpost when monsters attack and hold the gate until reinforcements arrive, or they could reclaim the gate for the empire after it falls.

_**Take Back the Gate (Mid Level).**_ As the characters travel through the region, they need to pass through the gate. When they get to the outpost, they learn that monsters from the mountains ([gnolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gnoll), [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin), [orcs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc), or [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll)) murdered the Crownsguard and have claimed the gate as their own. From this secure position, they launch more raids into the [[Marrow Valley]]. Someone has to stop them and take back the gate.
