### Talonstadt
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley
**Location**:: [[Marrow Valley]]

**Population**:: 1,810 (82% [[dragonborn]], 11% [[humans]], 4% [[halflings]], 3% other [[races]])

**Government**:: Talonstadt's refugees are organized by community leaders who manage to work together, despite their bickering.

**Defense**:: A small but functional band of volunteer fighters keeps watch alongside a minimal [[Crownsguard]] presence.

**Commerce**:: General goods and arms are available, if somewhat scarce beyond what the populace requires. Trade is minimal, and lodging is hard to find.

**Organizations**:: There are makeshift shrines to [[Bahamut]] in public gathering places. The [[Scars of Scale and Tooth]] have representatives present to help protect the interests of [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] refugees.

The fall of [[Draconia]] at the hands of the deadly chromatic [[dragon]] sect known as [[The Chroma Conclave]] sent the region into chaos. The [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] resistance rose up against the surviving [[Dragonborn|draconbloods]] in a bloody rebellion, while the dangerous creatures that stalked the [[Dreemoth Ravine]] closed in when the arcane defenses of [[Draconia]] fell. While many remained to rebuild from the ruins of the fallen city, dozens of [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] refugees and survivors fled across the dangerous lands of [[Xhorhas]], climbing over the mountains into the [[Marrow Valley]]. [[Bertrand Dwendal|The Crown]] wasn't eager to offer clemency to a number of foreign revolutionaries who overthrew an allied nation, but the [[Cerberus Assembly]] managed the development of a ramshackle shantytown for the [[dragonborn]] at the base of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]].

Although it is part of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], Talonstadt receives very little support from [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. Instead, the [[Cerberus Assembly]] pays meager wages to the refugees while promising that their hard work will one day allow them to earn imperial citizenship and a better quality of life for their families. With tensions between the refugees and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] escalating, and a [[Crownsguard]] that consistently turns a blind eye to crimes within the community, very few residents believe these empty promises.

Amid the chaos, a handful of Draconian sympathizers within the refugees actively undermine the [[Dragonborn|ravenites]]' community leaders.

The people of Talonstadt have great need of adventurers to protect them from crime, monsters, and each other. The community can't offer much in the way of monetary rewards, but they can provide forgotten stories and describe (relatively) safe routes through [[Xhorhas]] to the characters.
