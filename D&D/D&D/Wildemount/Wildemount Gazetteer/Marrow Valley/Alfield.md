**Government**:: [[Starosta]] Kosh Clearbarker cravenly delegates the responsibilities of governance to the local watchmaster and lawmaster.

Alfield is a rural town nestled into a scattered patch of trees near the Amber Road. The old mines winding beneath the nearby hills yield a fair amount of tin, copper, and quartz that supplement the town's economy. Small in size compared to the surrounding townships, Alfield is regarded by most travelers as a stop on the route to more important business elsewhere. This frustrates some proud residents and local entrepreneurs, but most prefer the small-town lifestyle and are happy to see the passing traders and travelers move on. Alfield is currently recovering from a recent assault by a roving band of violent [[gnolls]], so a number of buildings are still being repaired or rebuilt.

The [[starosta]], a middle-aged [[Gnomes|gnome]] named Kosh Clearbarker, leans heavily on his dutiful watchmaster, the [[Half Elves|half-elf]] Bryce Feelid. Bryce personally shoulders the town's burdens while the [[starosta]] continues to oversee the town from within his quarters, excusing himself from any hands-on governance.

Since Alfield is both overlooked and under-protected by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], charlatans and thieves often sweep through town in an attempt to relieve the townsfolk of any loose coin. The relatively small [[Crownsguard]] presence is perpetually frustrated with the lack of support from the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]; they must split the attention of their small force between policing the borders and watching for hooligans who seek to abuse the civilians within the town.

The welcoming farming community and beautiful countryside surrounding Alfield often call to those who want a simpler life in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Flanked to the north and east by the Alfield Wood, the town is shaped like a small diamond in shape, only a couple of miles across on all sides. The Dustway and Harvest Path roads divide the town into four quarters, meandering lazily through the ramshackle wooden buildings until they meet at the recently rebuilt Candleglow Inn at the center of town.

Between the recent [[Gnolls|gnoll]] attack, overburdened town leaders, and numerous criminals, the people of Alfield need the aid of adventurers.
