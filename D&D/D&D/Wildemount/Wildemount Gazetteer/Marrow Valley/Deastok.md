Travelers in the [[Truscan Vale]] find the city of Deastok at the southwestern edge of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The sister city of [[Kamordah]] to the north, Deastok is a borough that appears unusually affluent for its size, largely because the [[Truscan family]] has called the city home for many generations. Fine cobblestone streets connect numerous modern buildings and charming country shops, while elegant entertainment venues and picturesque views make the city a quaint [[Holidays in Wildemount|holiday]] location for many wealthy travelers.

While [[Starosta]] McGinneas is [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]-appointed leader of the city, it is no secret that the [[Truscan family]] is the real guiding force in Deastok. The [[starosta]] and all titled subordinates within the city were assigned at the behest of Prime Arbiter [[Sydnock Truscan]], and it is widely assumed that anyone in power is somehow related to the Truscans by marriage or blood, or is deeply indebted to them.

The clean, well-maintained streets are surprisingly free of crime for a city so socially stratified. There's a good reason that precious few petty criminals exist in Deastok: they've all been recruited by [[The Myriad]]!

Under the guidance of local crime boss Corshad Dumon, this city has been a major [[The Myriad|Myriad]] hub for decades, with secret subterranean bases and pathways beneath the city that enable the organization to go about its business unimpeded. Those that attempt to blow the whistle on [[The Myriad|Myriad]] activities vanish or meet a terrible end, so most city folk turn a blind eye to organized crime.

Deastok is a tidy city bordering the [[Cyrengreen Forest]], with a beautiful collection of quaint homes, fine goods, and affluent citizens. The central metropolitan portion of the city is divided into three areas. Most of the residential homes are located in the Garden Grounds, framed by curling parks and greenery. The Bursar Plaza marks the industrial district where shops, markets, and busking spots are carefully arranged for both commerce and atmosphere. The perimeter of the city is known as the Jeweled Gates, where the [[Crownsguard]] barracks and small military reserve are located. The soldiers guard the city and take shifts atop the Cyrios Mountain watchtower.

Most of the city is built atop a large, leveled hill, surrounded by farms that continue for hundreds of acres on the western, northern, and eastern sides. At the southern end of the city, where the hills slope down toward the [[Cyrengreen Forest]], a number of lumber mills bustling with gnomish technology harvest timber from the forest with impressive efficiency.

Elements of intrigue, noble finery, and [[The Myriad]] define adventures in Deastok. Characters might have adventures centered around grand parties, social gatherings, and whispered rumors.
