The settlement of Trostenwald lies at the southern outskirts of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], on the banks of the [[Ustaloch]]. The seeds of civilization were planted here nearly two centuries ago when the fair weather and stretching grain fields gave rise to a booming brewing economy. Three major families of brewers and alewives earned fame throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] by producing some of the best and most unique ales Dwendalians had ever tasted.

Ordering a "trost" has become common terminology in many taverns that serve the unique, sweeter ales of the settlement's breweries. Many attribute the distinctive flavor to the waters of the nearby [[Ustaloch]], while others attribute the flavor to an enchantment on the nearby soils hearkening back to the [[Age of Arcanum]]. Regardless, the ale has become the flagship export for the settlement, causing tension between competing families. The reigning three breweries fight for dominance over farmland and promotion of their products, while occasionally allying to squash out any upstarts who wish to encroach on the already crowded market. The known family brands that produce Trostenwald ale are Husseldorf, Bambauch, and von Brandt.

The city is headed by [[Starosta]] Fryda Langer, daughter of the last [[starosta]] who fell to illness two years ago. Her family has strong ties to the Bambauch family, leading some to mutter of favoritism, though they have no power to challenge her. [[Starosta]] Langer enjoys her position, often making public shows of her power by holding small celebrations and contests in her honor. Those she did not favor before taking office are rumored to have disappeared or been driven into poverty.

Crime in Trostenwald usually involves petty thefts of shipments and burglaries rather than any major conflicts. The [[Crownsguard]] have their pockets padded by the three brewing families to pay special mind to their wares. [[The Myriad]] has agents in Trostenwald, but the settlement is too sleepy to become an effective center of criminal activity. [[The Myriad|Myriad]] operatives do their part to push contraband smuggled in from the [[Clovis Concord]] north toward [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]].

Trostenwald is a rural borough of simple homes, competing breweries, and fishing huts that form a kidney-shaped layout, wrapping around the western end of the [[Ustaloch]]. Travelers from the south consider Trostenwald a simple and folksy welcome to the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

The city is broken into three main sections. The Northward borders the wind-kissed grain fields, and houses the privately owned breweries and other local industries. The Lochward forms the eastern portion of the settlement, comprised of residential neighborhoods and lakeside fishing communities. The southwest region is the Hillward, where the affluent and noble-blooded live among the guild halls, easily protected by the nearby [[Crownsguard]] barracks.

Characters in Trostenwald could get caught up in adventures with the three brewing families or [[the Myriad]]. They might suddenly get called to action while deep in their cups.
