### Mount Mentiri
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley
**Location**:: [[Marrow Valley]]

Mount Mentiri is a sky-piercing crimson monolith and an ever-present visual landmark within the [[Truscan Vale]]. Thin wisps of steam rise from numerous vents scattered throughout the massive mountain. The nearby Bromkiln Hills and the northern lands around Pride's Call have been altered by the elemental power that radiates from the rock beneath Mentiri.

The source of this subterranean heat is a mystery to the people of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Scholars have proposed many theories, suggesting that Mentiri may be a young volcano â€” or that it sits atop a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

None of their theories are correct. The truth is that [[Desirat]] the Twilight Phoenix, prized steed of [[Asmodeus]], is imprisoned deep within the curling caverns beneath the mountain, and her prison is surrounded by the fire giant city of Vuthos. The presence of [[Desirat]] has affected the people of [[Kamordah]] since the city was founded, and her messages call to the weak-minded in dreams, urging them to delve beneath the mountains to worship her as a god.
