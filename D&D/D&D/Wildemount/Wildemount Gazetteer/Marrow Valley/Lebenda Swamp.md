### Lebenda Swamp

The sprawling marsh known as the Labenda Swamp encompasses the valley along the southern side of the [[Silberquel Ridge]] and is fed by frequent rainfall. Surrounding the [[Ounterloch]], this immense swampland is humid for much of the year, making travel uncomfortable. The incessant hum of buzzing insects mingles with the musky stench of decaying plants and stagnant water, and thick fog obscures much of the muck-laden region. The marsh is home to trolls, carnivorous plants, and a host of other deadly creatures. Only the most experienced travelers dare wander too deep into the soggy reaches of the inner swamp, where it is said that rare plants and ancient ruins hide behind the mists.
