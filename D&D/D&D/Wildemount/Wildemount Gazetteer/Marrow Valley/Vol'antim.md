### Vol'antim

**Population:** 3,890 (96% aarakocra, 4% other races)

**Government:** Vol'antim is ruled by a council of twelve elders known as the Horizon.

**Defense:** The settlement's perilous surroundings make it easily defensible, and trained aarakocra warriors vigilantly protect it from above and within.

**Commerce:** General arms, simple supplies, and natural goods can be purchased or traded here. Lodging for guests is sparse.

**Organizations:** Dual temples to both [[Melora]] and [[Erathis]] mark the cliff face and interior caverns. No major organizations make their home here.

The hidden cliffside settlement of Vol'antim is nestled deep within the heart of the [[Cyrios Mountains]]. Tucked beneath an unreachable mountain precipice that soars over a thousand feet in the air above jagged rocks and brush, the community is home to aarakocra who live in relative seclusion. Few ever see these aarakocra, as they keep to the Cyrios Mountains and watch intently for uninvited guests.

The denizens of Vol'antim are proud of their isolationism and their adherence to the ancient ways of [[Melora]] the Wild Mother. For generations, they have carved their homes into the mountain cliffs. There are over a hundred caves adorned with colorful banners that mark the entrances to tunnels. These tunnels twist into a vast cavern, which houses the town proper.

The skies above the [[Cyrios Mountains]] are a battleground between the aarakocra of Vol'antim and their ancient enemies, the gorefeather harpies. Despite the birdfolk's best efforts, the gorefeather clan has only grown larger over time. Some fear that their matron has forged a pact with an evil power that has granted her people a stronger brood with each passing generation.

While the more learned people of [[Wildemount]] know of and understand the nature of the winged citizens of Vol'antim, the common folk often only catch occasional glimpses of them in the sky, and few people can claim to have met one. A handful of rural communities in the Truscan Vale refer to the flying creatures as their protectors and leave them small offerings before making dangerous treks in the region. The rare arrival of an aarakocra in one of these communities is a major event for the locals, and they shower the winged herald with gifts, much to the aarakocra's embarrassment.

The community is led by a dozen elders called the Horizon. Each elder chooses their successor on their deathbed; if no successor is named before the elder expires, one is chosen by the remaining Horizon members. When there is disagreement within the Horizon, the eldest member makes the final decision and all others respectfully follow. The community's laws are structured around the tenets of [[Melora]] and the respect that she has for her lover, [[Erathis]] the Law Bearer. Their foremost creed is that natural life is sacred within the ways of nature and must be protected.

The culture of Vol'antim eschews criminal behavior and acting outside the interests of the community. However, there are tales of past aarakocra who fell from the grace of [[Melora]] and followed a selfish path, and these figures were often punished with exile. Visiting outsiders have also been known to bring criminal activity to the city, contributing to the mistrust of those who come to the cliffs unbidden.

Standing high above a rocky valley, the mountain spire curls at its peak, forming a protective lip over the cliff face where the numerous cave entrances to the city are visible. Only accessible via flight, each entrance bears a small shelf or lip for arrival, often bearing banners or thatched decor to signify what is found within. Beyond these caves lies a network of small tunnels that open into a shared interior cavern, in the middle of which a one-hundred-foot-tall stalagmite merges with a matching stalactite to form a great pillar riddled with caves that connect to homesteads in the cavern walls via bridges and ropes.

If the characters earn the respect of the aarakocra of Vol'antim, they could be asked to help keep the [[Cyrios Mountains]] free from evil. If the characters instead earn their ire, they would do well to steer clear of the mountains.

_**Break a Few Eggs (Low Level).**_ The characters are asked by the [aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aarakocra) of Vol'antim to help destroy a nest of gorefeather [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/harpy). During the quest, the characters uncover a clutch of harpy eggs, which the aarakocra believe should be destroyed, since legends say that each generation of harpies is stronger than the last. If the characters destroy the eggs, they will drive the harpies to greater acts of destruction. But they refuse, how might the aarakocra react?
