### Brokenveil Bluffs

Long ago, the Brokenveil Bluffs were once a section of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] that linked to the nearby [[Dunrock Mountains]]. The mountain ranges were sundered in the final battles of [[the Calamity]], creating two mountain passes â€” the only land route that connects Eastern and [[Western Wynandir]].

The bluffs are known for their sheer cliff faces and brisk winds that loudly whistle through the network of caves and channels between the cracked rock. This region is home to many winged monstrosities, sure-footed terrors, and swamp creatures who wait at the boundaries of the [[Marrow Valley]] to swoop in and snatch the wayward traveler or soldier. The stories of the Brokenveil Bluffs are nearly as ominous as those told about the Xhorhasian landscape beyond.
