### Kamordah

**Population:** 7,440 (58% [[humans]], 23% [[halflings]], 13% [[dwarves]], 6% other races)

**Government:** Starosta Brennan Keef oversees his network of appointees, but his true loyalty is to the [[Truscan family]].

**Defense:** [[Crownsguard]] and hired mercenaries protect independent business interests.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies are available, but imported goods are more difficult to obtain. Rare plants, herbs, and wines support a profitable and well-guarded local industry.

**Organizations:** A few small, family-run temples are open to travelers, but the local businesses are fearful of outsiders.

Kamordah was built within the Bromkiln Hills by a collection of zealous followers of [[Desirat]] the Twilight Phoenix (described in [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-[[wildemount]]#DesirattheTwilightPhoenix "chapter 1")). They were eventually driven out by the Julous Dominion, who claimed the city and attempted to harness the intense geothermal activity in the area. When the dominion was conquered by the [[Dwendalian Empire]], it was discovered that this phenomenon infused the local earth with minerals that support a number of rare plants, ones that normally would not survive in Wildemount. This has led to a very profitable, carefully guarded industry of farming exotic herbs and fauna, as well as local vineyards that produce exquisite wines with flavors not found elsewhere in [[Exandria]]. Unfortunately, the ground water here is undrinkable, forcing denizens of the city to survive off captured rainfall and fresh water imported from outside the city.

While the majority of [[Western Wynandir]] and the [[Marrow Valley]] is filled with rolling fields of green grasses and tall, vibrant trees, the Bromkiln Hills that surround the city of Kamordah are gray and rocky, unable to sustain the vegetation. Patches of gray, bubbling mud form between the hills, where natural vents perpetually release lazy plumes of sulfurous gases that give the region its unmistakable smell. Mineral shelves surrounding areas of intense seismic or thermal activity sometimes produce rings of vibrant colors, and many locals study these minerals for their medicinal and arcane properties. Others worry that the source of this activity is a portent of terrible things to come, whether it be an imminent eruption or some slumbering elemental power.

Starosta Brennan Keef is the Crown-appointed governor of Kamordah. Though his close ties to the [[Truscan family]] grant him good standing with the Crown and local traders in the [[Truscan Vale]], locals grouse that he puts Truscan interests before those of his own people.

Coinmaster Dela Folger has a long-standing feud with Exchequer [[Aethia Drooze]]. Folger, a staunch supporter of Kamordan wineries and their local businesses, resists Drooze's attempts to squeeze every last copper out of Kamordah and into the Crown's coffers.

The businesses in Kamordah carefully guard their rare goods. [[Crownsguard]] mingle with hired mercenaries to keep a watchful eye on business deals, making the few criminals within the city extremely cautious.

Kamordah is a strange settlement built from pale stone mined from nearby [[Mount Mentiri]] and petrified wood from the surrounding forest. Constructed over the prismatic mud of the Bromkiln Hills, it resembles a collection of pearls against a smear of colored paints. The settlement is loosely broken up into two regions based on industry. The Rainbow Vineyards wind along the northern end, twisting up the base of the mountain paths, while the massive central Mudfields harbor greenhouses and research facilities alongside the scattered homes that comprise the remainder of the city.

Adventurers in Kamordah might become embroiled in squabbles over local goods, politics, or speculation concerning the source of Kamordah's geothermal activity.

_**Broken Earth (Low Level).**_ While the characters are in Kamordah, an earthquake topples buildings and releases lava from beneath the earth. The broken earth also opens the way for [magma mephits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/magma-mephit) that cause mischief around the settlement. If the characters manage to save themselves from the chaos, there are plenty of other citizens in need of rescue.

_**Twilight Phoenix (Epic Level).**_ The truth of Kamordah's geothermal activity is far more sinister and fantastical than many know. The ancient and mad twilight phoenix [[Desirat]] (see [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-[[wildemount]]#DesirattheTwilightPhoenix "chapter 1")) is chained beneath [[Mount Mentiri]]. A cabal of [archmages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage) who worship [[Asmodeus]] seek to free the Lord of the Nine Hells' steed, secretly gathering components for a ritual to sunder the mountain and unleash the crazed entity to incinerate the countryside. If the characters cannot stop the ritual, they must combat the twisted, primal phoenix herself.
