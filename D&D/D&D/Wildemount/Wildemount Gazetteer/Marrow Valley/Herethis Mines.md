### Herethis Mines

Platinum is as rare as it is beautiful, so when a very bountiful vein of the precious metal was discovered east of [[Deastok]] within the bounds of the Julous Dominion, the greedy lust for such a financial wellspring finally pushed the empire to break their agreements and conquer the dominion. Within the Crown's control, a vast mine has since expanded to extract the extremely valuable metal. However, the mine's proximity to the tenacious ankheg population that infests the [[Cyrengreen Forest]] continues to be a challenge. In addition, [[the Myriad]] has slowly infiltrated the operations of the mines over the past fifty years, regularly skimming from the platinum haul to fund its endeavors.
