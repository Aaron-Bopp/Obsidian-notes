**Location**:: [[Wildemount Gazetteer]]

[[Wildemount]] is a vast and war-torn continent where many legends of Exandria are forged, but it is just one of many remarkable lands across this vibrant world. Many other regions have been referenced throughout this book, including the majestic realm of [[Marquet]] and the neighboring continent of [[Tal'Dorei]], while others still remain undiscovered. This section outlines known regions of Exandria beyond the continent of [[Wildemount]].

### [[Moons of Exandria]]

Exandria has two known moons that orbit the planet. Catha, the larger and closer of the moons, is the herald of night travel and shines a bright white when visible in the sky. Catha is considered to be intrinsically tied to [[Sehanine]], and is regarded by some as a creation of the Moon Weaver to watch over the just and hide those who require obfuscation. Ruidus, the second moon of Exandria, is much smaller and farther away. With a slower rotation around the world and dark red-brown coloring, Ruidus is often difficult to see among the stars of the night sky and nearly impossible to spot during the day. Little is known of Ruidis, though older cultures and texts speak of it as an omen of ill tidings, or even a remnant of a [[Betrayer God]] plot left abandoned and unrealized.
