### Balenpost
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Eiselcross
**Location**:: [[Eiselcross]]

**Population**:: 205 (69% [[humans]], 11% [[halflings]], 7% [[gnomes]], 7% [[dragonborn]], 6% other [[races]])

**Government**:: Mages of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], led by Wardlow Akron, run Balenpost.

**Defense**:: A 10-foot-high wooden wall surrounds Balenpost. All the inhabitants are mages or adventurers capable of defending the outpost.

**Commerce**:: The residents here are outfitted with all they need to survive by the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Visitors can trade goods or services for lodging, rations, and other survival supplies.

**Organizations**:: The [[Cerberus Assembly]] runs everything in the camp, but a few of King [[Bertrand Dwendal]]'s spies are among the explorers' ranks.

A fort of frozen logs stands on the southwestern edge of [[Foren]], housing intrepid explorers overseen by the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Every waking moment of life in Balenpost is dedicated to planning and executing expeditions to uncover [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items on the island. Lady [[Vess de Rogna]] (see "[Cerberus Assembly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#CerberusAssembly "[[Cerberus Assembly]]")" in [[chapter 2]]) appointed Wardlow Akron (lawful evil, male, [[Humans|human]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) to oversee day-to-day operations of the fort. The explorers say that Wardlow is harsher than the winds when it comes to rationing supplies and driving expeditions to go farther and faster in the hazardous tundra.

The expeditions that leave Balenpost are run by mages that work for the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. These mages and their crews are given honors, accolades, and special privileges, such as more rations, when they uncover [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items. Teams that return to Balenpost to resupply have their wages docked until they return with a find.

Dwendalians with nothing to lose come to Balenpost to earn good pay, but many of the other explorers are prisoners quietly approached by the [[Cerberus Assembly]] and offered freedom in exchange for service. Prisoners that don't contribute to the expeditions are sent back to the mainland in chains, so many are willing to cheat, steal from, or kill other crews.

Balenpost is not just a place of discovery but also one of arcane experimentation. Wardlow Akron placed Korberta Horswell (chaotic neutral, female, rock [[Gnomes|gnome]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) in charge of the team that studies and tries to duplicate [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items retrieved from the wilds of [[Eiselcross]]. The reckless mage and her team perform all manner of experiments to recreate items brought back from the wastes. These tests often go dangerously awry. Death and magical destruction are not uncommon results, and a few items have warped or twisted subjects into horrible monstrosities that are locked away somewhere secret in the lab.

While the [[Cerberus Assembly]] is in charge of exploring [[Eiselcross]], [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] wants to make sure its interests are protected. The [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] reports enough discoveries to King Bertrand to make it seem like the sovereign is informed, but he knows better. King Bertrand planted spies among the explorers because he doesn't want the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] keeping the most powerful [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items secret, lest they be used to overthrow him. The leader of this spy ring is Karta Meck, a neutral [[Humans|human]] spy who also happens to be one of the camp's most accomplished treasure hunters.

Wardlow suspects that [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] planted spies in Balenpost and regularly tries to read the minds of explorers and look at communications sent out of the camp to find [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]'s agents. His attempts thus far have proven fruitless.

New supplies, letters, and people come to Balenpost from [[Icehaven]] by boat every month. These ships then take people and missives from [[Eiselcross]] back to the mainland of [[Wildemount]]. The journey through the [[Frigid Depths]] is perilous and can delay or destroy a resupply boat, an event which forces the outpost to restrict rations.

The main reason for many characters to come to Balenpost is to seek out [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items for themselves or the [[Cerberus Assembly]].
