Vurmas is a floating outpost for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] near the north shore of [[Gelier]], and the dynasty keeps Vurmas secret from other factions. The Kryn established this base near [[Eiselcross]]'s second-largest island not to find [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items but to make allies of [[Eiselcross]]'s wildfolk.

Vurmas is not a true settlement: it's actually three sailing ships tied together and anchored near the north shore of [[Gelier]]. These boats are the _New Radiance_, the _Candlefire_, and the _Soulsailor_. At any given moment, one of the ships could be traveling to [[Xhorhas]] with a hold full of new Luxon-worshiping wildfolk converts or on the way back to [[Eiselcross]] with more supplies.

The Kryn's explorers stay on the boats when they can, bringing supplies to shore when they go out in search of allies. These ships are maintained and run by Captain Hallwas Denalor (lawful neutral, female, [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran)), while Norca Brighttusk (neutral, female, orc [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest)) leads the expedition teams.

The [[Kryn Dynasty]] believes that the [[Wildfolk]] are a better find and more reliable than most [[Aeor|Aeorian]] objects, especially since the items tend to interfere with the Kryn's divine magic. With the [[Cerberus Assembly]] and the Uthodurnians busy in Foren, the Kryn stay clear of the largest island and search for allies in the rest of [[Eiselcross]]'s lands. Many wildfolk are easy converts of [[the Luxon]] since they respect divine magic but do not worship any deity.

The Kryn approach each wildfolk clan with caution and kindness, healing the sick and injured while preaching the faith of [[the Luxon]]. They take only willing wildfolk away from the clan, knowing many others will follow because they miss their friends and family.

Choosing the waters near [[Gelier]] as a base of operations was no accident. This island is home to the wormkin, wildfolk that devour the frozen form of [[Quajath]] (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-gazetteer-[[eiselcross]]#TomboftheWorm "[[Tomb of the Worm]]")" earlier in this chapter). These wildfolk have strange minds, but they display regenerative abilities because of their diet. Norca Brighttusk regularly preaches to the wormkin, telling them that the beast they feed on is a creation of [[the Luxon]]. The wormkin have agreed to convert and join the Kryn once [[Quajath]] is freed from the ice â€” an effort that is already underway. If the Undermaw and its people can be turned toward the light of [[the Luxon]], the [[Kryn Dynasty]] will have gained a considerable advantage in its war against the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. None of the Kryn, not even Norca Brighttusk, knows that [[Quajath]] has no intention of serving anyone and that the wormkin are completely under its sway.

The main reason for characters allied with the [[Kryn Dynasty]] to come to Vurmas is to join Norca Brighttusk's recruitment efforts, but there are plenty of other adventures to be had in the area.
