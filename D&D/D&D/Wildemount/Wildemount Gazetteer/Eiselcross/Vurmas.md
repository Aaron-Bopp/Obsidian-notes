### Vurmas

**Population:** 193 (51% dark elves, 23% orcs, 14% gnolls, 12% other races)

**Government:** Captain Hallwas Denalor has authority over this floating outpost, but Norca Brighttusk leads the expeditions.

**Defense:** Every inhabitant is an experienced explorer capable of defending the outpost.

**Commerce:** The outpost has no official economy, but people might be willing to trade for goods or services.

**Organizations:** The people of Vurmas are not associated with any organizations beyond the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

Vurmas is a floating outpost for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] near the north shore of Gelier, and the dynasty keeps Vurmas secret from other factions. The Kryn established this base near [[Eiselcross]]'s second-largest island not to find Aeorian items but to make allies of Eiselcross's wildfolk.

Vurmas

Vurmas is not a true settlement: it's actually three sailing ships tied together and anchored near the north shore of Gelier. These boats are the _New Radiance_, the _Candlefire_, and the _Soulsailor_. At any given moment, one of the ships could be traveling to [[Xhorhas]] with a hold full of new Luxon-worshiping wildfolk converts or on the way back to [[Eiselcross]] with more supplies.

The Kryn's explorers stay on the boats when they can, bringing supplies to shore when they go out in search of allies. These ships are maintained and run by Captain Hallwas Denalor (lawful neutral, female, dark elf [veteran](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran)), while Norca Brighttusk (neutral, female, orc [priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/priest)) leads the expedition teams.

The [[Kryn Dynasty]] believes that the [[wildfolk of Eiselcross]] are a better find and more reliable than most Aeorian objects, especially since the items tend to interfere with the Kryn's divine magic. With the [[Cerberus Assembly]] and the Uthodurnians busy in Foren, the Kryn stay clear of the largest island and search for allies in the rest of [[Eiselcross]]'s lands. Many wildfolk are easy converts of [[the Luxon]] since they respect divine magic but do not worship any deity.

The Kryn approach each wildfolk clan with caution and kindness, healing the sick and injured while preaching the faith of [[the Luxon]]. They take only willing wildfolk away from the clan, knowing many others will follow because they miss their friends and family.

Choosing the waters near Gelier as a base of operations was no accident. This island is home to the wormkin, wildfolk that devour the frozen form of [[Quajath]] (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-gazetteer-[[eiselcross]]#TomboftheWorm "[[Tomb of the Worm]]")" earlier in this chapter). These wildfolk have strange minds, but they display regenerative abilities because of their diet. Norca Brighttusk regularly preaches to the wormkin, telling them that the beast they feed on is a creation of [[the Luxon]]. The wormkin have agreed to convert and join the Kryn once Quajath is freed from the ice — an effort that is already underway. If the Undermaw and its people can be turned toward the light of the Luxon, the [[Kryn Dynasty]] will have gained a considerable advantage in its war against the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. None of the Kryn, not even Norca Brighttusk, knows that Quajath has no intention of serving anyone and that the wormkin are completely under its sway.

The main reason for characters allied with the [[Kryn Dynasty]] to come to Vurmas is to join Norca Brighttusk's recruitment efforts, but there are plenty of other adventures to be had in the area.

_**Keep Us Secret (Low Level).**_ Kryn spies report that the _Bold Adventurer_, a scouting ship from the [[Dwendalian Empire]], is planning to visit the island of Gelier, near Vurmas. Captain Hallwas Denalor and Norca Brighttusk don't want the _Bold Adventurer_'s crew to see Vurmas or reach Gelier, ensuring that the Kryn's operation in [[Eiselcross]] and the settlement of the wormkin remain secret. The pair offer the characters 500 gp to stop the _Bold Adventurer_'s approach. The _Bold Adventurer_ is a keelboat (see the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table in [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#AirborneandWaterborneVehicles "chapter 5") of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")) that carries six [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout). The captain of the Bold Adventurer, Sally Brizzberm, has a [sending stone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stone) that she uses to communicate with the captain of a Dwendalian warship called the _Bright Queen’s Doom_. If her ship is attacked, Sally uses the stone to send a warning to the warship, which might threaten Vurmas in the future.

_**Save Our Ships (Mid Level).**_ While the characters are aboard one of Vurmas's boats, three wildfolk [druids](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid), each riding on the back of a [killer whale](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/killer-whale), attack the boats. The druids are angry that wildfolk are leaving [[Eiselcross]] in droves to go to [[Xhorhas]]. They believe that the Kryn are using enchantment magic against these wildfolk, tricking them into leaving their friends and family. The druids use hit-and-run tactics, dealing as much damage as possible before fleeing. Captain Hallwas Denalor asks the characters to deal with the attackers. The druids could be open to negotiation, or they might fight with their dying breath for their beliefs.
