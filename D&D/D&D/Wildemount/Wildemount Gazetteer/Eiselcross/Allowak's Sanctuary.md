When Aeor fell into Foren, the impact threw a monolithic, purple crystal miles away from the crash site. The stone pierced the body of an abominable yeti named Allowak, but the crystal's magic preserved the yeti's corpse and absorbed Allowak's soul. When other yetis touched the crystal, their intellect increased and their innate desire to slaughter faded away. A society of the monstrosities living in huts and keeping mammoths for food sprung up around the crystal. These peaceful yetis abhor their more savage kin.

The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary keep their home a secret, for they worry that outsiders might try to steal the crystal. Although the crystal's effects seem permanent, the yetis fear that if it were removed from Allowak's remains, they would lose their newfound intelligence. If outsiders get close to the village, the yetis patrolling the village's borders approach and act like the more common and savage members of their species. The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary do not kill unless forced to, but they will cause injury to guard their secret.

In recent years, the yetis have acquired books and journals from explorers who died close to their camp. The tomes gave the yetis an understanding of the world beyond Eiselcross.

The yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary are led by an abominable yeti named Brightheart. She organizes adventuring parties of her people to search Foren for more of their kin to awaken with the crystal. Brightheart claims this recruitment is to increase the size and security of the community, but some whisper that she is building an army to take over Eiselcross, and possibly even more places beyond the Frigid Depths.

The [yetis of Allowak's Sanctuary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti-allowak-variant) are [yetis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti) and [abominable yetis](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti), with these changes:

-   Their alignments are neutral.
-   Each has an Intelligence score of 16 (+3) and a Charisma score of 10 (+0).
-   They can speak, read, and write Common and Yeti.

The characters could stumble across Allowak's Sanctuary or fight their way through the perimeter guards to uncover the village.

_**A Matter of Trust (Mid Level).**_ As the characters travel Foren, they find Dawnmind, a female Allowak [yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti-allowak-variant) (see "Allowak's Sanctuary Yeti Statistics") holding the tatters of a net as she lies in the snow, covered in claw wounds from others of her kind, with 1 hit point remaining. Three other yeti corpses, Dawnmind's companions, lie in the bloody snow nearby. Dawnmind begs the characters to escort her back to Allowak's Sanctuary along with the corpses. Her group failed to capture six wild yetis, but those yetis are nearby and stalk the characters if they help Dawnmind.

If the characters travel to Allowak's Sanctuary with Dawnmind, Brightheart welcomes them as heroes and thanks them with a place to stay, provided that they swear to keep Allowak's Sanctuary a secret â€” or the [abominable yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti) could order the characters to prove their loyalty by capturing a group of wild yetis or [mammoths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth) for her.
