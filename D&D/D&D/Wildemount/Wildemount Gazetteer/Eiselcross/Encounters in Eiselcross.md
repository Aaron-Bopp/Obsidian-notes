## Encounters in [[Eiselcross]]

[[Eiselcross]] is a land of strange magic, bizarre creatures, and fascinating people. Each day that the characters travel the land, roll a d20. On a result of 15 or higher, an encounter chosen or rolled on the [[Eiselcross]] Encounters table of the appropriate level occurs. Not all of these encounters are meant to result in combat, and the ideas on the tables can inspire encounters of your own creation.

Encounter

1

The characters encounter 1d4 wildfolk [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout) hunting a [saber-toothed tiger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/saber-toothed-tiger). The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition.

2

The characters encounter a lost [[Cerberus Assembly]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage) trying to return to [[Balenpost]]. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of [[Aeor]], and there is a 50 percent chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item.

3

The characters find a [griffon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/griffon) with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling)) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next 1d10 days.

4

The characters encounter the [revenant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/revenant) of a dead explorer from [[Balenpost]] who was murdered by one of its team and is looking for vengeance.

A [young remorhaz](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/young-remorhaz) ambushes the characters.

These explorers want to keep their operation covert. If they aren't convinced the characters can keep their secret, the Xhorhasians attack.

4

A [roc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/roc) flies overhead and attempts to scoop up a character of your choice as its next meal.

5

The characters encounter a coven of three [night hags](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/night-hag) searching for Aeorian items.
