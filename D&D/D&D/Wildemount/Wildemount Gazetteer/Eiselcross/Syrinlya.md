### Syrinlya

**Population:** 182 (72% [[dwarves]], 24% [[elves]], 4% other races)

**Government:** Professor [[Gulrim Shalebrow]] is in charge of Syrinlya, appointed to run the outpost by Queen Fruunast of [[Uthodurn]].

**Defense:** Syrinlya's inhabitants are explorers capable of defending the settlement.

**Commerce:** Syrinlya's explorers are willing to trade for meager belongings. Aoerian items can be sold to the Buyer (see "The Buyer's Hut" below).

**Organizations:** [[Elves]], [[dwarves]], and a few others from [[Uthodurn]] are the only residents of Syrinlya. Most have no organizational ties.

Syrinlya is a collection of yurts filled with mercenary explorers from [[Uthodurn]] looking to get rich. Professor [[Gulrim Shalebrow]] (see "[Diarchy of Uthodurn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DiarchyofUthodurn "[[Diarchy of Uthodurn]]")" in chapter 2) runs this outpost with few rules: just an unspoken agreement that all explorers have each other's backs against the harsh environment, just as they would back in their mountain home.

#### A Lawless, Moral Land

Syrinlya has few laws, but its explorers look out for each other. This is a courtesy they learned at home in [[Uthodurn]], where the [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] are interdependent. Most folks in Syrinlya share food when their hunts are good so that others return the favor when their luck runs out.

Syrinlya doesn't suffer bullies. The honor system is enforced by the toughest explorers, who don't hesitate to take justice into their own hands. One such individual is the dwarf Morgo Delwur (neutral good, male [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werebear)), a staunch friend and an even more staunch holder of grudges. Gulgrim is content to allow the explorers to keep order, as it saves him from having to govern and allows him to go off on expeditions of his own.

The largest yurt in the outpost is occupied by an [[Elves|elf]] called the Buyer (lawful neutral, nonbinary, high [[Elves|elf]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)). The Buyer was brought to [[Eiselcross]] by Professor Gulgrim Shalebrow to run the day-to-day operations of the camp while the dwarf explores. The Buyer keeps to themselves and refuses to share their real name, which is Elloway Tenvidas. When the Buyer acquires an object, they place the item into a large stone chest, which transports the object back to [[Uthodurn]] or [[Palebank Village]]. Some of the explorers think the chest could also be used to transport people, but none are brave enough to ask the mysterious Buyer or risk experimenting with the chest themselves.

The main reason for many characters to come to Syrinlya is to seek out Aoerian items for [[Uthodurn]], but there are plenty of other adventures to be had in the outpost.

_**The Arcane Tree (Mid Level).**_ While the characters are in Syrinlya, Morgo Delwur returns from an expedition with a bag of five green seeds from one of [[Eiselcross]]'s [[Aeor|Aeorian]] ruins. The [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werebear) lost a seed in the snow when showing them off, and a 15-foot-tall, green tree springs up overnight in the middle of the camp. Whenever a creature casts a spell that restores hit points or deals radiant damage to another creature within 90 feet of the tree, the tree uproots itself from the ground and attacks the creature. After killing the spellcasting creature and other threats, the tree replants its roots. Every 1d10 days the tree remains rooted, a new tree of the same type grows up from the ground within 30 feet. If the trees become a problem, Professor Gulgrim Shalebrow asks the characters to deal with them.

The [animated tree](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/animated-tree) uses the [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) stat block, with these changes:

-   It is unaligned.
-   It has resistance against necrotic damage and radiant damage.
-   It understands Common, Druidic, Elvish, and Sylvan but cannot speak.
