### Tomb of the Worm
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Eiselcross
**Location**:: [[Eiselcross]]

**Population**:: 345 (83% [[humans]], 17% [[halflings]])

**Government**:: [[Quajath]] commands the settlement's inhabitants telepathically, though a cult fanatic named [[Galgonos]] serves as the Tomb of the Worm's leader for day-to-day operations.

**Defense**:: All adult inhabitants in the Tomb of the Worm are capable combatants.

**Commerce**:: The Tomb of the Worm has no commerce, though [[Quajath]]'s meat is offered freely to travelers.

**Organizations**:: The [[wildfolk]] that live here serve only [[Quajath]], but they are friendly toward explorers from the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

Three decades ago, a clan of [[wildfolk]] on [[Gelier]] found the exposed body of [[Quajath]] the Undermaw poking through the wall of an icy cave. These accessible sections of the worm peek through the cave's ceiling and walls, and are still attached to the worm. The [[wildfolk]] who discovered this place consumed the Undermaw's exposed meat and found that it regrew. They now live in the cave, enjoying the easy, renewable source of food, and are now fully under the sway of the Undermaw. They invite others to join them, calling themselves wormkin.

The people living in the Tomb of the Worm work together in harmony. [[Galgonos]]  with the wormkin template described below) is the leader of the settlement, and he organizes parties of wormkin that search [[Gelier]] and the rest of [[Eiselcross]] for more [[wildfolk]] to join their ranks. Outsiders often find the settlement charming because of how well the villagers get along, though a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Insight)) check can tell that the wormkin are more dangerous than they appear. The villagers offer the Undermaw's meat to visitors and force-feed it to those who refuse but would make worthy additions to the Undermaw's army.

The wormkin have two goals: grow their numbers and free [[Quajath]] from the ice. What [[Quajath]] plans to have its followers do once it leaves the ice is known only to the Undermaw.

Humanoids that consume the Undermaw's flesh ten or fewer days after it has been removed from [[Quajath]] must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become wormkin 1d6 hours later. Wormkin can be identified by the black veins that cover their appendages and neck. Characters who become wormkin might become NPCs at the DM's discretion. A [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration) spell or similar magic removes all the wormkin features from a creature, restoring it to its original state. Wormkin gain the following features:

**Alignment.** The creature's alignment becomes chaotic neutral.

**Connected to [[Quajath]].** No matter where the creature is, [[Quajath]] can read the creature's every thought and memory and speak with the creature telepathically. [[Quajath]] can also access the creature's senses and perceive what the creature perceives. As a bonus action, [[Quajath]] can take direct control of the creature, choosing the actions, bonus action, reactions, and movement the creature takes until [[Quajath]] ends this control as a bonus action.

**Magic Resistance.** The creature has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** If the creature has at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn.

The characters might find adventure, allies, and adversaries in the Tomb of the Worm.

Before the characters reach the sea, six wormkin catch up to them. Their leader is [[Redjaw]], and the others are cultists, all with the wormkin template applied. [[Redjaw]] demands that the characters give back the food that was stolen and forces a fight if the characters refuse. If the characters return the meat, [[Redjaw]] invites them back to the Tomb of the Worm. If the characters go to the village, they find that Jarinmine and her friends have been captured by the wormkin and are about to be executed for their crimes.
