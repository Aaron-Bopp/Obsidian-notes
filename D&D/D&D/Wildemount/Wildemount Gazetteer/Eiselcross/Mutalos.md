### Mutalos

In the northern part of Foren, a strange patch of wilderness exactly 30 miles in diameter is avoided by the wildfolk at all costs. They call this region Mutalos. Every morning at dawn, the area's environment suddenly changes. Mutalos shifts from desert to forest, from mountainous to swamp, or from any one habitat to another without any discernible pattern. The area can even be a seemingly normal icy tundra, so unsuspecting explorers traveling through Mutalos could suddenly find themselves in the middle of the sea when the sun rises.

The origins of these environmental changes are unknown, but scholars believe an [[Aeor|Aeorian]] object fell from the city and created the region. All [[Wildemount]]'s factions are interested in an item of such incredible transmutation power.

When the environment of Mutalos changes, so do its inhabitants. At dawn, a mountainous region filled with kobolds, goats, and ogres might become a swamp inhabited by lizardfolk, rats, and yuan-ti. It is unknown where exactly these creatures come from and where they go when the regions change. They could be transported from other places in [[Exandria]], teleported from elsewhere in the multiverse, or created and destroyed by this strange magic. It is also unknown if the same creatures reappear with the same habitats or if the creatures are always new to Mutalos. The origin of the region's changes likely holds the answers to these questions.

Sometimes a creature that appears in Mutalos leaves the borders of the region. When this occurs, the creature becomes untethered from the magic that brought it to Foren and remains in [[Eiselcross]] even after Mutalos's environment changes. Many creatures from other habitats don't last for long in the arctic wastes, but a few are smart or strong enough to survive.

Each day at dawn, the habitat of Mutalos changes. You can choose or roll this new environment on the Mutalos Habitats table. If you roll the result of Mutalos's current environment, roll again until you get a new result.

Trying to find the origin of Mutalos's magic or simply traveling through the region is an adventure, but there are other reasons to explore the area.

_**Lost Staff (High Level).**_ Farrhan Yost (lawful evil, female, human [archmage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage)) was a part of the initial [[Cerberus Assembly]] team that explored [[Eiselcross]]. Now back on the mainland, she tells the characters she lost her [staff of power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-power) in Mutalos when the region was an ocean habitat, hoping it tempts them into exploring the region to find her old staff. As the characters search, she uses the [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying) spell to keep tabs on them. Should the characters discover her staff or any other interesting treasures, Farrhan teleports to their location with her shield guardian and offers a meager payment for the find. If the characters refuse, she attacks. Farrhan intends to get her staff back no matter what and wants to claim the characters' discoveries as her own.
