## Islands of [[Eiselcross]]

**Location**:: [[Eiselcross]]

[[Eiselcross]] is a collection of eight icy islands, some of which have small, snow-covered mountain ranges:

**Beissel.** [[Eiselcross]]'s third largest island is so far north that even prepared explorers have trouble surviving the cold. Most don't dare brave an expedition, and those who do turn back once they see the white dragons that rule Beissel.

**Dampfkan.** This island is an active volcano that steams into the sky. Dampfkan's few explorers have seen a large structure in the lava, but nobody knows what this mysterious monolith is.

**Foren.** The largest island of [[Eiselcross]] is also its most desirable destination for treasure-seekers, since [[Aeor]]'s main crash site is on Foren.

**Frostbogen.** Given its proximity to Foren, one might think that this island is also a popular destination for explorers. But ever since a [[Cerberus Assembly]] delegation of over one hundred people, their ship, and all their belongings vanished during an expedition to Frostbogen, no one has dared to explore the island.

**[[Gelier]].** [[Eiselcross]]'s second-largest island holds the body of [[Quajath]], and its wormkin (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-gazetteer-[[eiselcross]]#TomboftheWorm "[[Tomb of the Worm]]")" later in this chapter).

**Kaltsel.** The smallest of [[Eiselcross]]'s islands floats off the southeast coast of Foren and is said to be the home of Mynarc Furdahl, an undead warlock of [[Asmodeus]] willing to make deals in exchange for souls.

**Schneescel.** A permanent magical blizzard rages across Schneescel, a small island to the west of Foren, making it nigh impossible to explore. Many believe that a fallen [[Aeor|Aeorian]] relic causes this storm.

**Taergoss.** [[Eiselcross]]'s second smallest island is a favorite spot for fishing vessels to anchor overnight. The crews tend to stay on their boats and never set foot on shore, since faint wails can be heard at all times of day coming from Taergoss's center.
