## Wildfolk of Eiselcross

While most of the world did not know about Eiselcross's secrets for centuries, the islands are home to nomadic clans of humans and halflings. These people move in small groups, following herds of elk and mammoths. They have no gods but instead revere the animals and natural phenomena such as the wind, snow, and waves. The wildfolk avoid Aeor's ruins and the terrible dangers that lurk there.

Eiselcross's wildfolk live simple, harsh lives. They hunt, gather, and support each other, taking shelter in tents made of furs. If they have disputes with one another, they reconcile or simply go separate ways. Taking the life of another Eiselcross native for any reason is an even greater transgression than murder normally is in the other areas of Wildemount. The penalty for such a crime is a facial branding in the shape of a knife and permanent exile from any wildfolk clan.

For all their peace with each other, the wildfolk of Eiselcross are fierce warriors. Their cold environment shapes them, and they must defend against saber-toothed tigers, yetis, and even more dangerous predators such as white dragons. The wildfolk tend to be distrustful of outsiders, especially after seeing explorers from across the sea going into locations the native people dare not enter and using arcane magic to uncover the frozen secrets of their land.
