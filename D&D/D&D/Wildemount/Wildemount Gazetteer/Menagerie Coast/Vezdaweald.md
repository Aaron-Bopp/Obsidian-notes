### Vezdaweald

The Vezdaweald is a bright and sunny tropical forest composed of softwood trees that loggers from [[Port Damali]] commonly harvest for smaller crafts and goods. The beautiful woods are full of vibrant tropical flowers and birds that fill the air with a symphony of mingling music and calls—but it's at night that the forest truly comes to life. Millions of glowing insects emerge and transform the canopy into a dancing starscape.

Weddings and religious ceremonies of all faiths take place amid the stars of the forest—but the lights are not always a friendly omen. The glowing insects also summon forth the nocturnal dinosaurs, amphibious [Swavain basilisks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swavain-basilisk) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#SwavainBasilisk "chapter 7")), and other night beasts that call the forest home.

The softwood trees and beautiful scenery of the Vezdaweald attract loggers in need of the characters' protection from the forest's denizens.

_**Dinosaur Ivory (Mid Level).**_ A wealthy artist in [[Port Damali]] wants to use dinosaur bones for her next sculpture, so she sponsors a contest. The adventurers that bring her the most dinosaur bones by weight will be gifted 5,000 gp and immortalized in the sculpture.
