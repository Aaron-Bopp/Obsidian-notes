### Gilded Roadway
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast
**Location**:: [[Menagerie Coast]]

Running nearly the entire length of the [[Menagerie Coast]], the Gilded Roadway is a ribbon of civilization that links every major city in the [[Clovis Concord]]. This well-traveled highway is too long to be constantly patrolled, but small bands of [[Zhelezo]] do move from city to city, giving travelers at least the illusion of security. The Gilded Roadway is a symbol of unity between the coastal cities of the [[Clovis Concord]] and is even represented on the concord's official seal.
