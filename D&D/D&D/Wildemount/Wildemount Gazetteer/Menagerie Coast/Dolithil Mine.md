### Dolithil Mine
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast
**Location**:: [[Menagerie Coast]]

Northeast of the elven city of [[Gwardan]] lies the Dolithil Mine, owned and operated by the Dolithil Orekeepers Guild from within the city. The entrance to the mine remains hidden from view thanks to simple illusions put in place to deter thieves. While the mine yields a respectable amount of gold and platinum, it is notably rich in iron, tin, copper, zinc, and other more common metals that are used in the secret trade of steamcasting (see "[Gwardan](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-gazetteer-menagerie-coast#[[Gwardan]] "[[Gwardan]]")" later in this chapter).

Dolithil Mine is such a critical location for the [[Clovis Concord]] that adventurers could be hired to find the mine for the organization's enemies, or they might be paid to protect the place from threats outside and within.
