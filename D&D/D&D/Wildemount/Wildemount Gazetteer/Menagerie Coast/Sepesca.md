### Ruins of Sepesca

In the centuries that followed [[the Calamity]], the Ki'Nau people established Sepesca, meaning "Nature's End," as their holiest of burial temples, built over a lush grove where the blood of the Wild Mother is said to have spilled before the [[Divergence]]. Every Ki'Nau priest and king that passed was interred within Sepesca's massive stone structure.

An ancient feud between the [[goblinkin]] of the [[Lushgut Forest]] and the Ki'Nau came to a head a few centuries ago, when the goblins stormed the region and desecrated the Wild Mother's temple. The Ki'Nau protectors fled from the worshipers of [[Gruumsh]], and the abandoned holy site fell into ruin. Vengeful spirits and gnarled monstrosities are said to stalk its sunken halls, guarding the seeds of darkness left by the Ruiner's faithful.

A few descendants of the Ki'Nau across the [[Menagerie Coast]] still seek the means to cleanse this holy location and finally bring peace to the forgotten line of kings.
