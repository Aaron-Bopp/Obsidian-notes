### Wuyun Gorge

The dry, rocky valley that divides the southern pass between the [[Cyrios Mountains]] and the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] is known as the Wuyun Gorge, home to the [[Wuyun Gate]] that acts as the transition point between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Menagerie Coast]]. The road through the gorge is well-traveled, seeing carts and caravans throughout the year. Wandering creatures, violent giantkin, and hungry monsters occasionally descend from the mountains to prey on travelers. As such, it's common practice for people of means to hire mercenaries in [[Nicodranas]] or [[Trostenwald]]â€”the closest settlements on either side of the Wuyun Gorge.
