### Feolinn

**Population:** 12,700 (73% [[humans]], 10% [[elves]], 5% [[gnomes]], 12% other races)

**Government:** Marquis Hector Soliva runs the city, with wealthy, non-competitive businesses operating as an unofficial council.

**Defense:** Local [[Zhelezo]] keep the peace and protect the city perimeter. Affluent members of society also keep a hired guard.

**Commerce:** Most basic supplies are readily available in taverns, inns, and the marketplace.

**Organizations:** Shrines and temples to the Prime Deities are present, if downplayed in prominence. Local merchant families vie for financial and political dominance, leaving room for growing [[The Myriad|Myriad]] corruption.

Smaller than its nearest coastal neighbors, Feolinn is widely referred to as the Garden City for its rural aesthetic, proximity to the [[Plumgroves]], and well-kept parks and gardens. Feolinn acts as a harbor for the plentiful fishing around the Mother's Sigh Reef, as well as a destination for travelers looking to escape the chaos of [[Exandria]]'s woes. Feolinn is a popular destination for wealthy socialites, and it is filled with businesses that specialize in indulgence and self-pampering.

#### Tree and Vine

The abundance of fruit and sweet roots harvested from the [[Plumgroves]] has given rise to a competitive wine and spirits industry. Feolinn wines and ciders are renowned throughout [[Exandria]]. The vintners of Feolinn are known for their intense prideâ€”and for the disdain they have for other vineyards, such as those in the Dwendalian city of [[Kamordah]]. Classic vintages auction well in [[Port Damali]], while high-end liquor is presented as a fine gift in noble circles. Competition between the local wineries and distilleries is cutthroat, with major organizations such as the Soliva Winery, the Laffath & Legrand Vineyards, the Leoleoa Cellars, and the Purple Breast Company all vying for local and international renown.

Feolinn's reputation for vanity is well-deserved; even its leaders believe in their city's superiority. Marquis Hector Soliva of the Soliva Winery family is the third marquis of his bloodline to maintain the city's luxurious image, while also doing his best to elevate the prestige of his family's business. Local [[Zhelezo]] are often tipped by businesses to pay particular attention to their safety, or to pry into the affairs of competitors. This culture of bribery has caused Feolinn's [[Zhelezo]] to neglect the concerns of their city's underclass in favor of lining their pockets with "tips" from merchants.

Visible, violent, and unbecoming criminal activity is swiftly quelled to avoid tarnishing the reputation of the fair city. However, quiet lawbreaking occurs within back rooms of wineries and the mansions of the upper class. A number of powerful local businesses have even fallen in with [[the Myriad]] to unseat their competitors, and though few are aware of it, Feolinn is now nearly as corrupt as [[Port Damali]].

Buttressed against the southern tree line of the [[Plumgroves]] and surrounded by a number of small family farms, Feolinn is replete with rural charm. The city itself is comprised of four main roads that form a large rectangle, with each corner ending in a promenade filled with shops and pubs, while the city center is mostly made up of residential homes and affluent estates. Suamalie Way specializes in food and fine dining, while Alt'afi Avenue sports theaters, bathhouses, gambling halls, and other venues for private entertainment. Minceli Road contains administration buildings and [[Zhelezo]] barracks, and Soyer Street is home to many of the local harvesters and working class folk.

Feolinn is a good place for adventurers to get caught up in shady business deals and cutthroat competition.

_**Loose Lips (Low Level).**_ The characters are invited to a citywide alcohol fair, where Feolinn's wineries and distilleries enter their products to compete for prizes. The fair is secretly sponsored by [[the Myriad]], which plans to get the city's most influential people drunk and learn their secrets to use as blackmail. The characters get wind of this plan and must decide whether to stop [[the Myriad]] or get in on the plan.

_**Celebrity Endorsement (Any Level).**_ After the characters gain recognition for their deeds, the competing wineries and distilleries in Feolinn attempt to convince them to become official spokespeople of their brands, offering money and free booze. If the characters accept an offer, the rejected companies turn on them, trying to embarrass the characters at every turn and hiring rival adventurers to take credit for their accomplishments.
