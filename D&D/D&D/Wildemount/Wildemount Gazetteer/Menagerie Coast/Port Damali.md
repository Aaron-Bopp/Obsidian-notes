### Port Damali
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast
**Location**:: [[Menagerie Coast]]

**Population**:: 82,110 (51% [[humans]], 16% [[halflings]], 15% [[elves]], 18% other races)

**Government**:: The city is helmed by Marquis [[Olesya Lapidus]], who works with local guildmasters and nobles, bolstered by the distant support of the other [[Clovis Concord]] members.

**Defense**:: Port Damali maintains a sizable army alongside the many [[Zhelezo]] who guard the city. Nobles and wealthy merchants keep bodyguards.

**Commerce**:: Nearly any sort of goods or services can be found here, legal and otherwise. The high volume of travelers means that there are plentiful inns, taverns, underground markets, and rare auctions.

**Organizations**:: Temples to the Prime Deities are common, and some notable shrines to the Betrayer Gods are secreted away within this large city. The numerous merchant guilds run most businesses, but [[the Myriad]] is the real power behind the guilds themselves.

The jewel of the [[Menagerie Coast]], the original Marquesian colony, and the unofficial capital of free trade outside the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], Port Damali is a bustling city filled with music, color, and commerce. The massive port hosts ships from all around the world, creating a mishmash of cultures and trades that mingle to form the society of Port Damali. Trade routes splinter from all other sides of the city to ensure rapid transport of goods to destinations throughout [[Wildemount]] and beyond.

The city's architecture is varied and inconsistent; the inner wards display their own historical roots or lavish opulence, while the outer wards attempt to combat the slum-like atmosphere with cheap, colorful banners and street buskers. The city has a roiling underbelly of crime, murder, and corruption that many say is regrettable but necessary for the city to function.

The waters along the [[Menagerie Coast]] are rampant with piracy and roving ocean creatures, threatening trade and travel routes throughout the region. The [[Clovis Concord|concord]] has established a formal navy of nearly four hundred warships to maintain the sanctity of the surrounding ocean. These ships are scattered along the coast, with many stationed in [[Port Zoon]] or situated in the waters south of [[Nicodranas]] to prevent the current war from bleeding into [[Clovis Concord|concord]] territory, but a quarter of the entire navy is maintained within and around Port Damali.

A popular destination within Port Damali for wealthy merchants, nobles, and collectors from all across [[Exandria]] is the Exalted Collection Auction House within [[the Gilded Esplanade]]. Run by the esteemed Lord Gabriel Rymmer of the influential Rymmer family, this grandiose, if gaudy, establishment has all manner of rare items, collectibles, and historical artifacts brought from around [[Exandria]] to be sold to whomever offers the most gold, with a small portion of the sale filling the family's coffers. Socialites, nobility, celebrities, and the fabulously wealthy of [[Exandria]] travel here from all over the world, forging bonds of rivalry with each purchase. When particularly powerful relics find their way to the auction house, it's rumored that beings from the [[Outer Planes]] will masquerade as merchants to snatch up such prizes.

Until recently, many of the businesses in Port Damali were heated and powered by a system of steam-powered engines, which were installed beneath the city's streets. Unknown to most citizens, a marid had been shackled within the sewers to power the steam engines for decades. Recently, another marid in [[Nicodranas]] was freed from a similar situation, inspiring an anonymous adventurer to free the marid in Port Damali from its shackles, leaving the engines inert and many businesses without power. A large group of hired druids and mages are maintaining what functionality they can, but Marquis [[Olesya Lapidus]] is desperately looking for an alternative energy source or a replacement for the steam engines.

#### Port of Sky and Sea

Port Damali is the central city for most seafaring business and shipping throughout the Lucidian Ocean and a popular destination for those with gold, but it is also the only city in [[Wildemount]] with a skyport. While the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] refuses to establish a skyport within [[Rexxentrum]], in what many believe to be a symbol of their dedication to their isolation, Port Damali occasionally receives skyships from [[Tal'Dorei]] or [[Marquet]], drawing crowds that rush to see the majestic display.

The laws of the [[Clovis Concord]] are enforced with varying stringency within each city. Nowhere is this more true than in Port Damali, where the law can be bought like any other commodity. Anything can be purchased here, even the ear of Marquis [[Olesya Lapidus]], the celebrated leader of Port Damali.

The Lapidus family rose to prominence over a century ago, when they shifted from employing merchants to deploying mercenaries. In time, anyone who sought safety on the waves turned to Lapidus family privateers. As the fifth in her family to lead Port Damali, Marquis Olesya steadfastly collaborates with the other leaders of the [[Menagerie Coast]] to keep the [[Clovis Concord|concord]] an independent nation, free from imperial control.

However, Marquis Lapidus faces threats on all sides. When she was distracted by the rise of [[the Revelry]], the long-dormant [[The Myriad|Myriad]] swooped in and conscripted many of the guilds she was supposed to oversee. Now she struggles to excise [[the Myriad]] claws embedded within the belly of her city.

Port Damali has been a pivotal nexus of [[The Myriad|Myriad]] activity for some time, and nearly all elements of major commerce within the city are tied to the crime syndicate in some way. Many of the powerful merchants and company owners are either part of [[the Myriad]] or are indentured to it. As such, the city is the beating heart of [[Exandria]]'s slave trade, with slavers passing through often to discreetly move their bounty.

Those who fail [[the Myriad]] are shackled and shipped off as living contraband. [[The Myriad|Myriad]] operatives are plentiful within the law enforcement of Port Damali, so most illegal activity is covered up or allowed to slide, unless such crime interferes with [[The Myriad|Myriad]] interests.

The largest city on the western coast of [[Wildemount]], the resplendent seaside metropolis of Port Damali is nestled against the Tyodan River where it meets the Lucidian Ocean. The city is built atop a cluster of leveled hills, and slight changes of elevation physically mark the variation between wards. Past the farmsteads, beyond the tents and ramshackle homes that mark the boundaries of the city, lies the Prism Path, a series of connecting main roads made of smooth, multicolored stones reclaimed from the ocean shores. These roads carve through the interior wards: [[the Tumbledowns]], [[the Beaded Alley]], [[the Crescents]], [[the Gilded Esplanade]], and [[the Larboard Light]].

Between the [[Clovis Concord]], [[the Myriad]], [[the Revelry]], skyships, auctions, and more, adventure abounds within the colorful city of Port Damali.
