### Gravid Archipelago

These three islands are comprised of steep, volcanic peaks with sheer cliff faces, pock-marked with numerous caves housing [blood hawks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blood-hawk), [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/harpy), and (rumor has it) an impossibly big [roc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/roc). There are only small pockets of trees and jungle, so resources are scarce and few ships have a legitimate reason to stop here. However, this does not stop the Revelry from using the region for storage, ambushes, and meetings outside Darktow.
