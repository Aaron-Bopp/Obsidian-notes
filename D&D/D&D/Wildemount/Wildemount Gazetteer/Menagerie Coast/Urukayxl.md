### Urukayxl

The island of Urukayxl was once the site of the temple of the leviathan Uk'otoa. Many centuries ago, the spiteful followers of Zehir murdered Uk'otoa's Ki'Nau adherents and used the temple as the seal preventing Uk'otoa from returning to the Material Plane.

Forgotten in the years since, the fallen temple is surrounded by jungles that now harbor feuding clans of lizardfolk and yuan-ti. These yuan-ti are servants of the Cloaked Serpent and still maintain the crooked temple in the image of their banished god. Between the disease-carrying insects, the deadly jungle, and the treacherous Inkclaw Reef, many consider the region cursed and avoid it at all costs.
