### Gwardan

**Population:** 18,900 (63% elves, 16% humans, 11% gnomes, 10% other races)

**Government:** The city is governed by the four Noldar, one of whom must act as marquis.

**Defense:** Gwardan has a respectable force of Zhelezo, mercenaries, and trained citizen militia. Elders and prominent figures keep a small personal guard.

**Commerce:** Most basic goods and facilities can be found within the city, while rarer commodities are scarce. Inns and taverns are limited compared to other coastal cities.

**Organizations:** The Houses of Sagacity (see "Geography" below) are the center of worship, though small shrines dot the city. The [[Clovis Concord]] is involved in the city's affairs, though kept peripheral by the Noldar. Myriad interests are slowly invading.

After the sea guardian of the Ki'Nau was banished, the [[Menagerie Coast]] received an influx of travelers from [[Marquet]]. Many Ki'Nau of elven heritage joined the desert elves of Marquet to seek a new home. They traveled inland toward the protection of the [[Cyrios Mountains]], where precious metals and stones lay unclaimed, and paid their respects to the fey folk of the Doralle, taking only what lumber they felt was needed. Together, they built a new center for elven culture among the fields outside the forest.

When the [[Clovis Concord]] was established, Gwardan was the force that mandated autonomy between each city-state. The elegantly carved wooden arches of Gwardan rise out of the fields like the waving grass writ large, with neighborhoods of domed yurts rising into tall spires of brass and silver. The Houses of Sagacity allow a limited number of students annually to join their halls to seek higher knowledge.

The elves of Gwardan built sprawling mines throughout the nearby mountains, becoming the most renowned metallurgists and smiths across the [[Menagerie Coast]]. The mingling of elven cultures has occasioned the guarded development of a unique style of metalworking. Blending organic designs with super-heated caustic mists, the "steamcasting" process imbues metal with a prismatic shimmer and enables cheap, brittle materials to become as workable and as strong as steel. Gwardan is known across Exandria for its unique steamcast goods, and no one else has managed to get the style quite right, making Gwardan's decor, jewelry, and weapons coveted throughout the world.

General city affairs are overseen by the Noldar, a council of four figures who represent the larger facets of Gwardan society. Though the Noldar were established in the interest of fairness, they were forced to select one of their number as their marquis when Gwardan entered into the [[Clovis Concord]]. Currently, Marquis Vasan Atrith has led the Gwardan people for just under a century, and is seen as both just and forthright.

While Marquis Atrith has been willing to allow outsiders to visit and live within the city, rising crime and rumors of [[the Myriad]]'s return to the [[Menagerie Coast]] have set her on edge. Thieves have tried numerous times to uncover the secret process of steamcasting, causing her to increase the number of Zhelezo patrolling the city streets. These Zhelezo were drawn from [[Port Damali]], and their presence has given Port Damali's leaders the power to interfere in local affairs, to the Noldar's consternation.

Gwardan is a beautifully rustic yet elegantly refined city of stained wood and gold that rises from the windswept tallgrass fields, cultivated farm land, and clustered trees of the chilly northern plains. The outer ring of the city, called the Anorans Ring, is comprised of numerous domed abodes of bowed lumber and carved bark where families make their homes. The Houses of Sagacity form a prestigious region where three temples built for worship also provide a variety of advanced studies to a limited student body. These are the House of Enlightenment under [[Ioun]], the House of Invention under [[Moradin]], and the House of Enchantment under [[Corellon]].

The Korrwa Ring is the inner ring of Gwardan, where business is conducted between peddlers, merchants, and craftsmen. Within that ring stands the Ornatora, a massive tower of latticed wood spiraling upward like a crafted, leafless tree. Disc-like homes and chambers protrude from the tower at varying intervals, granting the wealthy folk of the city a magnificent view. The peaks of the tower house the Noldar, as well as the central meeting chambers where local political discussion takes place.

Characters could come to Gwardan seeking steamcast goods or any of the city's strange crafting secrets.

_**Bring 'em Back (Low Level).**_ Talamin Raanan (chaotic neutral, female, high elf [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)) once worked for the [[tribes of Shadycreek Run]] as an assassin. The elf disappeared five years ago, but spies report that she resides in Gwardan under the name Valemis Tirdra. One of the Shadycreek Tribes, or a faction that wants to see Talamin pay for her crimes, hires the characters to capture the elf. When the characters find Talamin, they learn that all she desires is to leave her violent past behind and live out her days with her new family, including her two young children.
