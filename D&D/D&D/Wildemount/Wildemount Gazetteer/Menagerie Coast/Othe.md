### Othe

**Population:** 8,320 (64% humans, 16% halflings, 11% half-orcs, 9% other races)

**Government:** Matters of state are managed by Othe's marquis, while local industrial and religious leaders govern on a smaller scale.

**Defense:** Zhelezo guards and volunteer citizen warriors maintain the law and protect the city.

**Commerce:** Basic needs can be readily tended to through a trading post or inn. Some traveling merchants bring outside goods, but rarer commodities are sparse. Othe exports herbs with natural medicinal properties at high cost.

**Organizations:** A collection of small temples resides in the Apa-feids. Merchant guilds are small but work in conjunction with one another. Myriad agents are embedded in numerous elements of the city.

Established around 410 PD by the Ki'Nau as a shamanistic site for meditation and medicinal ritual, the location expanded into the village of Othe when Marquesian explorers discovered the unique properties of the [[Othemoor]] and the flora it sustains. Othe is the smallest of the coastal [[Clovis Concord]] domains, and the local leaders are generally left to their own devices. This makes the social environment of Othe extremely insular and less hospitable to outsiders who don't go out of their way to engage with the locals.

While the bogs surrounding Othe aren't the most picturesque of settings, the city is a regional center for spiritual guidance. Within the Apa-feids of Othe lie many humble temples, where numerous holy guides welcome travelers who seek a comforting word or a moment of clarity. The spiritual traditions of the native Ki'Nau people are alive and well here, and have melded with worship of the gods to create a unique religious practice. Here, connections are forged between the modern tenets of the gods and the animistic faiths of the Ki'Nau people in search of universal truth.

The Marquis Mata Laau-afu is a respected spiritual shaman who has followed in his family's tradition for generations. While he acts the part of the wise and mysterious guide to the people of the marsh, Mata is also a shrewd negotiator and clever bureaucrat when dealing with the other marquises and the politics of the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Bolstering his Zhelezo with a handful of faithful druidic guardians of the [[Othemoor]], Mata remains vigilant in the protection of his people and their interests.

As watchful as the marquis intends to be, the growing demand for Othe's unique medicinal herbs has drawn the attention of opportunists and swindlers. Myriad agents masquerading as potential investors and partners in small family businesses have tried to abscond with herbal cuttings, but haven't yet been able to break into the highly secretive society that cultivates them. Those that are caught trying to steal or counterfeit Othenian herbs are usually thrown into the Bogpit prison, and weightier crimes come with severe penalties, such as being left tethered and submerged in the most putrid swamps of the [[Othemoor]].

Shaped like a large crescent, this settlement is built across a series of five small land masses that rise above the waterline of the [[Othemoor]]. These landmasses are all connected by bridges, and each of the city's districts is built atop one or more of these islands. First, the Rudwashes are a residential district whose houses have been built using bricks made of red clay from the marsh. The port, known as the Stark Docks, is where small boats and storage buildings are used by the laborers of the city to gather resources. The Apa-feids form the central bulk of the city, with more modern buildings and the elevated hall where the marquis resides. Here, a circle of small temples represents the prime pantheon.

While the winds are often earthy and mingled with marsh air, the simpler, pastoral lifestyle of Othe is more relaxed and spiritual than other locales along the coast.

The characters may come to Othe to seek guidance from one of the city's many temples.

_**Seeking Misguidance (Any Level).**_ A ranking official of the [[Clovis Concord]] is in Othe seeking guidance on handling [[the Myriad]]. The criminal organization hires the characters to pose as holy guides and convince the official to work with [[the Myriad]] instead of against them.
