### Palma Flora

**Population:** 1,780 (68% humans, 13% halflings, 11% dwarves, 8% other races)

**Government:** An elder manages settlement-wide issues, but most people tend to their own affairs.

**Defense:** An untrained militia composed mostly of shark hunters defends the settlement from pirates and sahuagin.

**Commerce:** The settlement exports some fish, fruits, and alcohol, but makes most of its money through tourism.

**Organizations:** Local farmers and brewers established the Palma Flora Traders to collectively barter with larger, more powerful ports.

The community of Palma Flora occupies the southern tip of the Vezdali Peninsula, and is a favorite vacation destination for merchants and Zhelezo from nearby [[Port Damali]]. While this settlement is small, it's famous for its annual shark hunting tournament and a popular cocktail that bears the settlement's name.

Most tourists are familiar with Flora Isle, which is home to the port and a shimmering beach. Most vacationers stay in the Riptide Inn and Tavern, sipping on fruity drinks while watching the shark hunters practice on the southern shore. The island is separated from the rest of the peninsula by a wide channel spanned by a wooden bridge. Most residents of Palma Flora live and work in the northern half of the settlement and retire to the southern island after a hard day's work.

Though Palma Flora is the perfect place for a vacation, it's not without trouble.

_**Tide of Retribution (Low Level).**_ Palma Flora's shark-hunting tradition has earned its people the ire of a [sahuagin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sahuagin) clan living in the Sharkfeather Abyss, a nearby undersea trench. The sahuagin tend to their flock of sharks peacefully and view the shark-hunters as cruel poachers. One sahuagin has made a pact with the leviathan Uk'otoa and sworn vengeance on the people of Palma Flora.
