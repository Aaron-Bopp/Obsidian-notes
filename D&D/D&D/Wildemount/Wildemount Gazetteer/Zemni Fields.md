Along the frost-dappled fields of the northern plains, the heart of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] is formed by a sprawl of dirt-packed roads, dense forests, and austere townships that fight back the dangerous creatures of the wilderness. Divided from the southern [[Marrow Valley]] by the mountains of the [[Silberquel Ridge]], this region is known for its gray skies, fits of cold rain, and occasional snowfall, keeping the feet of the denizens muddy and their crops healthy. The [[Dunrock Mountains]] shield the people from the threats that loom beyond the boundaries of the king's rule, with the [[Rockguard Garrison]] to the east holding firm against the deadly armies of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the dangers that brew beyond the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]]. Home to the mighty imperial capital of [[Rexxentrum]], these fields are the seat of power and commerce for the empire. Diplomats often find themselves traveling to and from the Zemni Fields, while traders and merchants from around the world traverse the long roads in hopes of making their fortunes in the capital city. Even so, the growing ferocity from beasts and creatures that share this region mingle with the whispers of a recovering criminal element and the escalating war with the Kryn to create a perpetual air of tension and anxiety.
