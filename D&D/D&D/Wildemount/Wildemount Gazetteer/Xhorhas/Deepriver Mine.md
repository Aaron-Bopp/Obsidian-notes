Established around a plentiful source of iron and copper within a dry, subterranean riverbed, the Deepriver Mine is one of the dynasty's most productive mining operations. Workers toil away within the mines beneath the red canopy of the Vermaloc, or work the smelters that litter the courtyard, preparing to send their goods to [[Rosohna]] or farther into the west of [[Xhorhas]].

Since the conflict with the [[Dwendalian Empire]] has escalated in recent decades, Den Icozrin established an impressive steelworks alongside the Deepriver Mine to expedite the forging of armaments. The Icozrin Steelworks has since grown to become a construction yard for war machines and siege weaponry to be sent to the front lines in the west.
