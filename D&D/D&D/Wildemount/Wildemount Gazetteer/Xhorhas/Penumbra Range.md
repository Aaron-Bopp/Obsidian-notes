### Penumbra Range
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

Dividing the marshes and badlands of [[Xhorhas]] from the ghastly boneyards of the [[Blightshore]], the Penumbra Range is an unusually steep series of black rock mountains that rise against the horizon like a huge jaw of pointed teeth. Hiking across the sharp, glassy rock is an extremely dangerous feat that would challenge even the most experienced travelers.
