### Dumaran
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

The hobgoblin fortress of Dumaran is built into the western base of the [[Penumbra Range]], hidden within the south end of the web-infested [[Vermaloc Wildwood]]. Dozens of defensible portholes and arrow slits look down over the walkways that wind across the face of the impressive fortress, while curling paths lead up into the mountains. Within, countless halls, chambers, and tunnels are carved through the rock.

Following [[the Calamity]], the hobgoblin survivors were scattered, fighting the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]] for scarce resources. They drew the attention of [[Lolth]], who seduced and empowered the hobgoblins of Dumaran. Although they were not drow, the hobgoblins joined the ranks of the [[Children of Malice]], giving them dominion over the spiders throughout the Vermaloc and honing them into a ferocious army to topple the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] as punishment for their insolence.

Twisted by the dark gifts of their murderous goddess, the hobgoblins of Dumaran have onyx black fur, pale yellow eyes, and a hunger for slaughter. Their nocturnal hordes strike out in the dark of night, commanding the massive, venomous arachnids of the Vermaloc to aid their raiding parties. Their rituals emphasize their loathing of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] drow, the same who abandoned their Spider Queen, and they work to slowly build paths through the [[Penumbra Range]] toward [[Rosohna]] to eventually corrupt the city from the shadows.

Like an equally dark mirror of the [[Lolth]]-worshiping drow in distant regions of [[Exandria]], the warrior matrons of the [[Children of Malice]] hold power within Dumaran, leading their family houses while serving under Head Matron [[Vivurk Tonn]]. Though many drow societies are filled with political scheming and infighting to win [[Lolth]]'s favor, their queen's seething hatred of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] focuses these drow against a common enemy, making the forces of Dumaran a ruthlessly efficient engine of vengeance.

While crimes occur from time to time, the threat of swift and brutal punishment is enough to keep the inhabitants of the fortress in line, unless they are absolutely certain they can get away with a misdeed or prove that their actions further [[Lolth]]'s goals.

Those who serve the Spider Queen in [[Xhorhas]] often pass through Dumaran, and heroes who seek to end her poisonous influence might attempt to destroy the stronghold.
