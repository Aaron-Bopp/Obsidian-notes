Bazzoxan was once a dark temple instrumental in the machinations of the Betrayer Gods during [[the Calamity]], but the remaining ruin was left to gather dust like many relics of those terrible times. After [[Ghor Dranas]] was claimed by the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], settlers roamed north through the [[Barbed Fields]] to discover this site with hopes of renovating it as well. A community began to flourish within the ruins of Bazzoxan over a few generations, building the foundations of a new city around the looming stone structures of the abandoned sanctum—until demonic forces from within the old temple threw the burgeoning society into chaos. Bazzoxan is now perpetually locked in a stalemate between the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]'s forces and the abyssal incursion from within the temple. This unholy site is the subject of constant research and of growing worry for the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]].

About forty years ago, a group of curious local dungeoneers uncovered a long-dormant gateway to the Abyss. Its demonic influence drove them mad, and they accidentally reactivated the gateway of Bazzoxan—an immense rift between the Abyss and [[Exandria]]. This enabled demonic forces to pour out into the ruins and surrounding city. The incursion was eventually stifled, though at a great loss of life. The civilians that remain in Bazzoxan support the warriors who keep the forces of the Abyss at bay, as well as the arcanists who work to reseal the rift and reclaim the city.

The town is under martial law, with [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers keeping the peace under the current governance of Taskhand [[Verin Thelyss]]. The taskhand's lieutenants serve as minor officials and bureaucrats, and even the civilians who continue to stay are trained to defend themselves and fall into rank if malevolent forces rise from beneath their home.

With the tension of living in constant fear of demonic threat, the focus on survival in Bazzoxan leaves little room to break the law for personal gain. Even so, the rare grifter sometimes profits from gouging the price of provisions or swindling the fearful. Criminals who are caught by the Watch are sent south to [[Rosohna]] for punishment or simply executed, depending on the severity of their crimes.

The towering ruined temple sits against the rocky southern base of the [[Penumbra Range]], carved directly from the natural stone of the mountains. The ominous onyx doors that lead into the heart of the temple remain barred and under constant watch. Surrounding the temple are over a hundred abodes and structures, as well as a partially reconstructed town square. Construction equipment lies abandoned in the streets, and vacant homes sit untouched since their denizens were slain or forced to flee. Makeshift [[Aurora Watch]] barracks are continuously expanded to make room for the reinforcements sent to push back the fiends that assail the city from beneath.

Adventurers loyal to the [[Kryn Dynasty]] are welcome in Bazzoxan and will almost certainly be asked to aid with keeping Abyssal forces at bay or gathering spell components for the mages trying to seal the rift.
