### Verstglade

A small valley of crooked, leafless trees is hidden in the tallest peaks of the southern [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], though few know of its existence. During the [[Age of Arcanum]], this dark and menacing wood once was an experimental playground for the terrible lich [[Vecna]], where he would manipulate and twist all manner of life, arcana, and undead to his sick whims. The countless years of misuse left the withered forest corrupt and overrun with nightmarish abominations and cursed, undying minions who were abandoned to their madness. Mercifully, Vecna was banished before he could unleash his creations on [[Wildemount]], and his aspirations for godhood left his intended plots with Verstglade forgotten.

Verstglade is filled with forgotten experiments that characters might be asked to retrieve or destroy.

_**The Whispered Study (High Level).**_ Cloaked by illusion and filled with deadly traps, one of the primary laboratories of [[Vecna]] remains hidden within the Verstglade. It is home to many powerful artifacts and arcane secrets, and the promise of such mighty rewards draws a bold few to attempt to locate it. Of the few mortal minds that even know of Verstglade and what lies hidden within it, only brave adventurers or the minions of evil are foolish enough to enter the corrupted woods.
