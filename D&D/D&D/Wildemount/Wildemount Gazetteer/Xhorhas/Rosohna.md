### Rosohna ([[Ghor Dranas]])
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

**Population**:: 113,190 (66% [[Dark Elves]], 9% goblins, 7% [[duergar]], 18% other [[races]])

**Government**:: The twelve ruling [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] Dens oversee the city, all at the command of [[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] and the Bright Queen herself.

**Defense**:: A mighty army of [[Aurora Watch]] protects the city, while mounted weapons and ballistae stand at the ready. Each [[Den]] employs personal guards, as well as highly trained bodyguards for their nobles.

**Commerce**:: Most any goods or services can be found within the city, with distant imports available on the black market.

**Organizations**:: The majority of temples here are dedicated to [[the Luxon]], but smaller shrines to the rest of the pantheon are scattered throughout in the outer districts. The merchant guilds are organized by the Dens and closely tied to the faith of [[the Luxon]]. Agents of the [[Children of Malice]] are sown like seeds of chaos throughout the city.

The realm of [[Xhorhas]] was home to the strongholds of the Betrayer Gods as they walked the realm of mortals, but the beating heart of their mercurial alliance was the dark city of [[Ghor Dranas]] (meaning "gathering of shadows" in [[Draconic]]). A monument to the union of tyranny and chaos, the shaded skies framed the dozens of crooked towers and war barracks that surrounded the central citadel of Virkwzual, or "Dark Bastion" in the [[Infernal]] language. The final battles of [[the Calamity]] were waged around [[Ghor Dranas]], and much of the city was reduced to ash and dust. Towers crumbled, the ground opened to swallow the legions of the Betrayers, and the citadel was left sundered and abandoned. It wasn't until the surviving [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] [[Dark Elves|drow]] emerged from the [[Underdark]] that the city rose from its ashes.

The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] slowly cleared the ruins of the corrupt creatures that had claimed it for so long. They built new structures on the foundations of the ancient city while expanding the underground levels beneath, bringing new life to the city of [[Ghor Dranas]], which they named Rosohna, or "Rebirth," in their tongue.

Rosohna is the center of the powerful [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] society, a symbol of dark history reclaimed. Its tall, dusky spires and beautiful buildings rise from the broken shards of [[the Calamity]]. Breaks in the constant cloud cover offer glimpses of sunlight, which is seen as a holy gift shining on the many monuments to [[the Luxon]]. Crystalline halls of glass and quartz glow with interior light in the traditional [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] hues of green and purple.

The streets are lively with city-dwelling [[Wastefolk]], [[the Luxon]]-worshiping [[Dark Elves|drow]] who live beneath the open sky to spite [[Lolth]]'s design, and even a few [[duergar]] and other beings from the [[Underdark]]. Local businesses thrive as the Xhorhasian community grows, and goblinoid merchants have found profit and comfort within this [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] civilization. Even so, most people beyond the borders of [[Xhorhas]] only see Rosohna as an unbroken link in the legacy of [[Ghor Dranas]], a city born of malevolent gods and their murderous spawn.

As the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] discovered their cycle of reincarnation, many began to find beings outside the [[Dark Elves|drow]] lineage undergoing anamnesis, the process in which a creature reincarnated by a [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) begins to recall memories from its past lives. Unexpectedly, the spirits of heroic [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] were reborn in various intelligent creatures outside the [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] society. With this knowledge, the ruling dens of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] began to reevaluate their treatment of non-[[Dark Elves|drow]], instead seeking to bring the light of [[the Luxon]] to the [[Wastefolk]] of [[Xhorhas]]. While many beings across [[Xhorhas]] and beyond still cultivate mutual animosity toward the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], there is a growing number of goblins, ogres, [[gnolls]], [[orcs]], and many other beings who have found a new home and purpose under the rule of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. Thanks to the miracle of anamnesis, [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] society has become a diverse and thriving community that spreads across [[Xhorhas]].

The [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] and [[duergar]] bloodlines are averse to sunlight, which presents a challenge to a culture that journeyed to the surface out of love for their light-bearing god. Periods of worship involve occasional prayer and meditation in the warmth of daylight, but twelve hours of daylight each day can become painful and physically detrimental to those beings adapted to subterranean life. To mitigate this problem, powerful [[Dunamancy|dunamancers]] have woven arcane shields to temporarily block out the sun above Rosohna. Periods of days, sometimes weeks, will transpire in a state of perpetual evening, enabling the darkness-bound denizens to go about their work. Such periods briefly come to an end to usher in periods of scheduled, mass worship under the sunlight.

#### Above and Below

Rosohna is built on the remains of [[Ghor Dranas]], and an entire, unseen level of the city lurks beneath the surface. These caves and tunnels were used as torture dungeons by worshipers of [[Torog]], and the Dens of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] have spent centuries reclaiming the space for their own people. Much of the dungeon remains abandoned, but a great many layers have been cleared and transformed into underground neighborhoods, hubs for subterranean travel across [[Wildemount]], and farming caverns for crops of edible fungi. However, the [[Kryn Dynasty]] has secretly allowed some hidden chambers to fulfill their original grim purpose as cells for vile criminals and political prisoners.

The ruling class of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] is seated in Rosohna, spread across twelve noble Dens—all of whom seek to one day rule the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. They play an intricate political game by expanding their families of timeless souls and covertly undermining the authority of other Dens.

Each [[Den]] traditionally oversees a portion of local industry, but the more distinguished Dens also vie for control over aspects of spiritual or military leadership. [[Den]] Masters keep a careful eye out for weakness among other Dens, seeking ways to sully the reputations of their rivals while displaying their own worthiness to the Bright Queen. Such social sabotage is reminiscent of the old ways of the [[Dark Elves|drow]], but assassinations and acts of outright violence are rare. The three ruling Dens—[[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], [[Den]] Thelyss, and [[Den]] Mirimm—are each helmed by an [[Umavi]]. Of those families, [[Den]] [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] holds supreme power, for its head is Bright Queen [[Leylas Kryn]] herself.

Conflict and struggle are as common in Rosohna as in any other metropolis, and though the unifying faith of [[the Luxon]] helps maintain the peace between disparate and sometimes violent residents, old habits are hard to break. [[Den]] Mirimm has enacted a tough, sometimes brutal approach to law enforcement that helps discourage violent behavior.

Blackmail is common between political figures, and those that indulge in this vice believe that they can absolve any sins through pious prayer, reasoning that their actions are only illegal if they're caught.

Those who have been found guilty of major crimes against the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] are locked away in the [[Dungeon of Penance]] (see "Geography" below), or taken out beyond the reach of the beacons and executed, with no hope of rebirth.

Nestled protectively within a deep valley alongside the [[Penumbra Range]], the majestic, ominous, and beautiful city long known as [[Ghor Dranas]] stands as a symbol of renewal and change. A vast medley of bright and wondrous structures, grandiose towers, and crystalline cathedrals soar into the sky, thriving among the broken remnants of a ruined metropolis that was once nothing but ash and haunted memories. Districts are laid out in the husk of the ancient capital like a series of layers, each ward growing more refined and enlightened the closer one gets to the center of the city. These layers are [[the Ghostlands]], the [[Coronas]], the [[Gallimaufry]], the [[Firmaments]], the [[Shadowshire]], the [[Lucid Bastion]], and the [[Dungeon of Penance]].
