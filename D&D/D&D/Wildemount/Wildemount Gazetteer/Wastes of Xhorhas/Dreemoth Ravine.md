### Dreemoth Ravine

Along the southeastern range of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], an impressively deep gorge cuts into the mountains for nearly eighty miles. Winding and widening, the enormous ravine reveals a beautiful, rocky valley of sparse trees, natural caverns, and incredible waterfalls tumbling from the Ashkeeper runoff. Strong winds blow through the gorge, and the numerous natural cliffside outcroppings provide shelter for wild griffons, wyverns, and other flying beasts. The central bend of the Dreemoth Ravine still contains the [[Ruins of Draconia]], as well as the countless abandoned caves and quarries that once held the enslaved ravenites, now freed.

Characters might come to Dreemoth Ravine to capture and train a flying mount, or to explore the [[Ruins of Draconia]].

_**Bones of Frigid Doom (Epic Level).**_ A [death knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-knight) named Pentrakath lurks in a cave in the Dreemoth Ravine, and he has uncovered the bones of Vorugal, the [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-dragon) that destroyed [[Draconia]] twenty years ago. He gathered a host of profane relics and stole the souls of hundreds of dead dragonborn in an attempt to stitch together a soul powerful enough to resurrect Vorugal as an ancient white dracolich (see [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")).
