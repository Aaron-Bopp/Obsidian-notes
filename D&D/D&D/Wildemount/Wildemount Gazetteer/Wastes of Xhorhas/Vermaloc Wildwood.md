### Vermaloc Wildwood

The Vermaloc Wildwood is an enormous timberland of vibrant trees with deep purple and maroon trunks and a bright canopy of red-orange leaves. This curious and beautiful burst of color stands in stark contrast to the often dreary landscape of Xhorhas. Many denizens of Xhorhas have camps or small settlements along the treeline, as the forest is one of the major sources of wood and logging throughout the wastes. Those who live here, however, remain alert for the many deadly beasts and creatures that call this colorful expanse home. Monstrous predators twisted long ago by the Betrayer Gods hunt from the trees and brush, while the deeper woods are overrun with the webs of the malicious giant spiders that claim those shaded regions. Only the most experienced and well-armed hunters dare wander the depths of the Vermaloc.

_**Ettercap's Web (Low Level).**_ Aramue, a [dryad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dryad) of the Vermaloc Wildwood and devout follower of the Wild Mother, possesses a unique gift: she can send dreams to other worshipers of Melora. Using this power, she reaches out to such individuals. Aramue needs help ridding her forest of an [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ettercap) that has taken control of many of the forest's [giant spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider). The spiders attack the forest's outlying settlements and bring prisoners to the ettercap, which it sacrifices to gain Lolth's favor. The dryad is kept awake at night by the ettercap's screaming victims.
