### Asarius, the City of Beasts

**Population:** 48,025 (41% goblinoids, 32% gnolls, 10% dark elves, 17% other races)

**Government:** Den Olios governs the city, the laws of which are enforced and monitored by captains of the [[Aurora Watch]].

**Defense:** An impressive army is stationed on the outskirts of the city, comprised of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers and trained local warriors, as well as mercenaries.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies and equipment are available, as well as quality arms and some rare goods. Inns and taverns offer austere accommodations.

**Organizations:** There are several temples to [[the Luxon]], as well as some shrines to other deities. Merchant unions are beholden to the will of Den Olios. Meanwhile, [[Lolth]]'s [[Children of Malice]] lurk in the shadows.

Encircling and covering a massive, cracked hillside in the center of northern [[Xhorhas]], Asarius has grown into a cluttered sprawl of roughshod homesteads, mud huts, and military fortifications that are home to a bustling blend of the many peoples of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. The city is a cultural hub established by the Kryn for the wilder folk of the surrounding wastes and nomadic peoples who joined the dynasty. The Kryn convinced these [[wastefolk]] to unite under their banner by promising them protection, resources, and, in many cases, enlightenment (followed by conversion to the faith of [[the Luxon]]).

Although the establishment of Asarius was initially fraught, the city quickly grew into a symbol of unity for the scattered cultures of northern [[Xhorhas]], who eschewed the dangerous, competitive fight for survival to instead focus on building a community. In the generations since, the city has blossomed into a tangled web of quirky neighborhoods, filled with industry and musky scents. The muddy plains outside are tilled for hearty roots and produce, monstrous livestock are herded and kept in large pens and pits, and a growing force of [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers train and prepare to battle the forces of the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

Asarius, the City of Beasts

The wastes have always bred strong peoples who could survive despite the harsh environment, deadly wildlife, and scarce resources. Many of the [[wastefolk]] fought each other over hunting grounds and territory until the Kryn rebuffed attempts at violence and instead offered to bring together the tribes for the common goal of mutually assured survival. Some were intrigued by the opportunity, while others did not fully trust the strange elves who chose to wield words instead of swords. The early establishment of Asarius was marked by conflict, and while the community has since flourished, there are still many who live beneath the dynasty's protection but mistrust the dark elves' intentions.

While many see the establishment of Asarius as pure altruism on the part of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], one cannot deny the importance of the city's central location among the wastes and strategic proximity to the border of the empire. The Bright Queen has transformed the tiny township into a gargantuan military hub for the dynasty, enlisting many thousands of [[wastefolk]] to form the backbone of its standing army. Wide swaths of military tents cover the western outskirts of the city as countless soldiers prepare for the coming conflicts in the west, training atop the terrifying war beasts and towering war machines brought from [[Rosohna]] or built alongside the towering walls of Asarius.

The rule of law is tenuously imposed throughout the chaotic city, where the squabbles of argumentative civilians often lead to physical conflict. The laws of the dynasty, which stem from the faith of [[the Luxon]], are enforced by a network of trusted [[Aurora Watch]] captains and soldiers who report to Den Olios within the Aurora Hold. Local affairs are the jurisdiction of Lady Zethriss Olios, who works with representatives of each major neighborhood to manage the city and its people.

Blood often runs hot in Asarius, and folk here often come to blows, simply to deal with the stress and frustration of life on the plains. The Kryn know this; as such, their laws regarding physical assaults and fights are far laxer in this city than anywhere else in Kryn territory. Even so, disagreements can escalate to a point where theft, brutality, and murder sometimes occur with worrying regularity.

The majority of this rough, boisterous city is draped across a wide, muddy hill that overlooks the surrounding plains. The hill is surrounded by fifteen-foot-tall walls of purple vermaloc wood, harvested from the eponymous [[Vermaloc Wildwood]]. The interior of the city is a tangled mass of wayward, mud-slick streets and a hodgepodge of homes and structures that architecturally mirror the social mixture of dark elf society and the many nomadic lifestyles of the [[wastefolk]]. The center of the city is marked by the ominous spire known as the Aurora Hold, home to Den Olios.

The southeast region of Asarius is called the Pits, named for the multitude of breeding pits for war beasts and other beasts of burden. The Pits are responsible for the city's ever-present smell of wet animals and dung, and the area is also home to many poorer citizens seeking work wherever it can be found. The southwest portion of the city is known as the Creets, a rustic tangle of goblinoid neighborhoods and houses of farming folk who till the harsh environment beyond the eastern walls. The entire northern side of the city is simply known as the Northroads. Within this area, the Scowl Square is the center of commerce, and the North Center forms the industrial core of Asarius. An average of four thousand [[Aurora Watch]] are stationed outside the western walls of the city, with additional reinforcements during times of looming conflict.

Characters might come to the City of Beasts to find a reliable war beast, receive military training, or spy on the Kryn military preparations.

_**War Beast Escape (Mid Level).**_ While the characters stay in Asarius, [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy) from the [[Dwendalian Empire]] infiltrate the city and simultaneously release war beasts from their pens after enraging them with whips and hot irons. As the characters try to stop the rampage, they learn that the spies are using the confusion to steal the city's secrets.

_**Echo of the Past (Mid Level).**_ A chaotic good, male, [[dranassar]] survivor named Jibu-Corryn has been living as a dark elf in Asarius under the name of Alyxikon, a minor government secretary. A cult of [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin) and [bugbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bugbear) who call themselves the Lords of Strife are hunting Jibu after hearing a rumor that one of the last of the dranassar are hiding in Asarius. Their leader, a hobgoblin captain named Gorthux, possesses the power to transform into a [bone devil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bone-devil) once per day, and plans to offer Jibu as a sacrifice to [[Bane]].

Jibu has heard tales of the characters' prowess and contacts them with a cryptic note. He begs for protection while he settles his affairs in Asarius and travels to a hermitage in [[Blightshore]].
