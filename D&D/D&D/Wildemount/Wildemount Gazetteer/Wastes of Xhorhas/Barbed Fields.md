### Barbed Fields

The valley north of Rosohna is covered by this broken and marred landscape of jagged rock, sunken craters, and scabrous, hooked spires of glass and rock jutting from the ground. It is said that the final battles of [[the Calamity]] were fought on this valley floor. The earth is so scarred here that few question the veracity of this legend. Treacherously unpredictable earth crumbles into sinkholes surrounded by thick, caustic tar pits that swallow careless wanderers, while the storms common to the region bring rain-slicked mud traps and flash floods.

However, powerful relics and armaments have been recovered from these ancient battlefields, so the strong and the stupid occasionally venture into the dangerous fields, often finding themselves hunted by the monsters that lurk in this ruined domain. It is rumored that toward the center of the barren fields grows a beautiful, towering tree that grew from the final seed left by [[Melora]] before she vanished to her realm beyond the Divine Gate. Powerful followers of the Wild Mother sometimes make a pilgrimage to this tree for guidance and communion, but the fields are so fraught with evil that few ever return.

Barbed Fields

The deeply wounded lands of the Barbed Fields are rife with planar entities bleeding through where the veils between worlds are thin.

_**Dark Days (Epic Level).**_ The extremely rare double eclipse, when the moons Catha and Ruidis overlap before the sun, is approaching, and it will occur over [[Xhorhas]]. Seers and oracles warn of portents that speak of an uncontrollable planar crossover, where multiple planes might briefly collide. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to bolster their ranks in preparationâ€”but no one is prepared for the army from the Nine Hells that invades the fields when the realms merge. Leading this evil army is a [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pit-fiend) named Vanatoth.
