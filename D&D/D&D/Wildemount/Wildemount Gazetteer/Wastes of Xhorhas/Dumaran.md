### Dumaran

The hobgoblin fortress of Dumaran is built into the western base of the [[Penumbra Range]], hidden within the south end of the web-infested [[Vermaloc Wildwood]]. Dozens of defensible portholes and arrow slits look down over the walkways that wind across the face of the impressive fortress, while curling paths lead up into the mountains. Within, countless halls, chambers, and tunnels are carved through the rock.

Following [[the Calamity]], the hobgoblin survivors were scattered, fighting the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]] for scarce resources. They drew the attention of [[Lolth, the Spider Queen]], who seduced and empowered the hobgoblins of Dumaran. Although they were not drow, the hobgoblins joined the ranks of the [[Children of Malice]], giving them dominion over the spiders throughout the Vermaloc and honing them into a ferocious army to topple the Kryn as punishment for their insolence.

Twisted by the dark gifts of their murderous goddess, the hobgoblins of Dumaran have onyx black fur, pale yellow eyes, and a hunger for slaughter. Their nocturnal hordes strike out in the dark of night, commanding the massive, venomous arachnids of the Vermaloc to aid their raiding parties. Their rituals emphasize their loathing of the Kryn drow, the same who abandoned their Spider Queen, and they work to slowly build paths through the [[Penumbra Range]] toward Rosohna to eventually corrupt the city from the shadows.

Like an equally dark mirror of the Lolth-worshiping drow in distant regions of Exandria, the warrior matrons of the [[Children of Malice]] hold power within Dumaran, leading their family houses while serving under Head Matron [[Vivurk Tonn]]. Though many drow societies are filled with political scheming and infighting to win Lolth's favor, their queen's seething hatred of the dynasty focuses these drow against a common enemy, making the forces of Dumaran a ruthlessly efficient engine of vengeance.

While crimes occur from time to time, the threat of swift and brutal punishment is enough to keep the inhabitants of the fortress in line, unless they are absolutely certain they can get away with a misdeed or prove that their actions further Lolth's goals.

Those who serve the Spider Queen in [[Xhorhas]] often pass through Dumaran, and heroes who seek to end her poisonous influence might attempt to destroy the stronghold.

_**Matron of Malice (Mid Level).**_ The [[Kryn Dynasty]] aims to create upheaval within Dumaran by hiring the characters to infiltrate the fortress and assassinate Head Matron [[Vivurk Tonn]]. To get to her, the characters are given potions that can polymorph them into dark elves for 24 hours.

_**A Looming Visit (High Level).**_ Intercepted messages between the [[Children of Malice]] speak of a ritual that is being prepared in the heart of Dumaran in the coming weeks. Victims have been captured for a mass sacrifice, and the messages mention a "great arrival." The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to uncover more information about this ritual, attempt to release any prisoners, and, should the opportunity present itself, stop this ritual or destroy whatever arrives at its completion.
