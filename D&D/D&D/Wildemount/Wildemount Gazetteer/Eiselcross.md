**Location**:: [[Wildemount Gazetteer]]
Far north of the rest of [[Wildemount]] is a collection of imposing islands of ice, danger, and powerful, forgotten relics. Eiselcross and the [[Greying Wildlands]] are collectively known as the [[Biting North]]. For centuries, most of the world dismissed Eiselcross as an uninhabitable glacial land of blizzards and yetis. Only fishing vessels ever got close to the frozen shores â€” until one of those ships found an [[Aeor|Aeorian]] item.

The flying city-state of [[Aeor]], a place of inventors, magic, and progress, was hurled into Eiselcross by gods both good and evil during [[the Calamity]]. The Prime and Betrayer deities agreed on a momentary armistice to achieve this mammoth task, for [[Aeor]]'s people crafted weapons made to kill the gods and had to be stopped. The gods tried to wholly destroy [[Aeor]], but its protections against divine entities were carefully tuned and unexpectedly strong. It took the most of the pantheon to crash the city.

[[Aeor]] was long believed to have been obliterated, and the gods' silence on the matter only furthered this conviction, so the books of lore left nothing more to be studied or discussed on the once-powerful nation. However, recent discoveries of [[Aeor|Aeorian]] artifacts revealed the truth of [[Aeor]]'s resting place and spurred rumors of arcane secrets frozen beneath the ice of Eiselcross. Now Dwendalian, Uthodurnian, Xhorhasian, and mercenary expeditions search the hazardous terrain for materials that could change the tide of the war between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Kryn Dynasty]].
