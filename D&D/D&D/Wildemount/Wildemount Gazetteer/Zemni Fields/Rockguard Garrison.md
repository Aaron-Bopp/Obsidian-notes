### Rockguard Garrison

**Population:** 6,800 (71% humans, 12% halflings, 12% dwarves, 5% other races)

**Government:** The garrison is commanded by Marshal Garad Velious, who oversees regiment captains that hold sway in the area.

**Defense:** Three regiments of Righteous Brand soldiers defend and patrol the garrison and the surrounding mountains.

**Commerce:** Most supplies within are military rations and stationed equipment. Trade with the local soldiers can yield goods and services.

**Organizations:** Small shrines to empire-approved gods have been constructed by the soldiers. Aside from the Righteous Brand, the Crown, and their allies in [[Grimgolir]], no other organizations have authority over the garrison.

The Rockguard Garrison was constructed in a joint effort between the Crown and [[Grimgolir]] as a symbol of their political union. The sister-fortress to the [[Ashguard Garrison]] is the foremost defense post against the ever-encroaching forces of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the monstrous hordes of the wastelands to the east. It boasts a formidable army and a near-impenetrable perimeter that expands into a series of defensible weapon posts along the sides of the valley to further dissuade any force from attempting an invasion. This fortress has held strong for generations without being breached, but the loss of the Ashguard Garrison is still fresh in the minds of the soldiers stationed here. A cold intensity hangs over each passing day as the Dwendalian forces plot to reclaim their captured outpost and remain vigilant against a similar assault.

Rockguard Garrison adventures usually relate directly to the war. Defending the outpost from attacks, planning strikes against the Kryn, and other military missions for the Crown are carried out here on a daily basis.

_**Steal the Plans (Low Level).**_ Agents of the Kryn hire the characters to infiltrate the Rockguard Garrison and uncover the Crown's plans to retake the [[Ashguard Garrison]]. The Kryn want any physical plans the characters find to remain in place to ensure the Crown doesn't realize the plot, so all written documents containing key information need to be copied. The garrison's [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard), [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout), and [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) patrol the place and question characters who obviously sneak around or don't belong.
