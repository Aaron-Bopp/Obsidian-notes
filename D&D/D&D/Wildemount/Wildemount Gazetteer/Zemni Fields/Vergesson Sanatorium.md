### Vergesson Sanatorium
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

During the war between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Julous Dominion]], a vast prison known as the Archevault was made as a jail for prisoners of war. After the war, the Archevault was repurposed by the [[Cerberus Assembly]] as the largest imperial sanatorium and hospital. Named after Lord Symon Vergesson, the late [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] member who founded it, the massive mansion is surrounded by vast gardens and filled with beautiful artwork designed to please the primarily wealthy patients.

The sanatorium's patients are treated for physical and mental ailments severe enough to require alchemical, magical, or experimental therapy. Helmed by Gertrude Wagner, the Sanatorium Director, the faculty is monitored by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. The facility offers treatment to those who require assistance and can pay handsomely, but beneath the pleasant mansion lies a torturous oubliette for political prisoners.

While the reputation of the Vergesson Sanatorium is sterling, it hides dark secrets. The original purpose of the Archevault was never fully discarded, and a number of vocal critics of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] have disappeared from the streets of [[Rexxentrum]]. Deep beneath the floors of the estate lie hidden chambers and cells that house enemies of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], foreign spies, and traitors to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] privately sentenced by Prime Arbiter [[Sydnock Truscan]]. There, they are subjected to experiments conducted in secret under the supervision of Master [[Trent Ikithon]] of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. A tower on the northern outskirts of the grounds acts as Trent's summer home, where he houses and trains the prospective members of his Volstruckers, an elite group of spies and assassins who use magic to do the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]'s dirty work.

Most who adventure in the Vergesson Sanatorium are trying to free a prisoner. Just finding a captive hidden in the massive complex is a challenge, but if the characters become imprisoned in the Archevault themselves, they must survive and form a plan to escape.
