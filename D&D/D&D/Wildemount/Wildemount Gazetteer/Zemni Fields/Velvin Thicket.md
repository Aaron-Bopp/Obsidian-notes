### Velvin Thicket

**Population:** 850 (98% gnomes, 2% other races)

**Government:** The people of the Thicket are governed by a loose union between the leaders of the Velvins, the collection of local nomadic clans who convene only when threatened.

**Defense:** While few are specifically trained for combat, many denizens of the Thicket are well-versed in illusion magic for self-defense.

**Commerce:** Those that have the trust of the Velvins can acquire basic supplies, dyolet fruit, and the occasional unusual relic.

**Organizations:** Scattered altars to the Wild Mother exist throughout the Thicket. Each of the seven nomadic clans handles its own internal affairs. Representatives from Pride's Call often visit for a time to maintain their relationship with the Velvin leaders.

Bordering the soggy fields of the Saltwallow Bog is the strange forest known as the Velvin Thicket. The nomadic gnomish clans that call these dense woods home have a loose network of allied families rather than a central township, and they defend their shaded sanctuary with illusions and enchantments. Because of the Velvins' trade agreement with Pride's Call, the dwarven city was able to request that the empire keep the thicket from becoming formally assimilated into Dwendalian society so long as the Velvins provided a small but consistent crop of dyolets. The dyolet fruit is a rare delicacy receptive to minor enchantments and only grows within the Velvin Thicket. The empire's interest in permitting Velvin autonomy has waned over the years, and the Cerberus Assembly is keen to take the Thicket under its jurisdiction and seize control of the dyolet crop.

The gnome families that live in the Velvin Thicket are suspicious of outsiders. The Cerberus Assembly's interest in the area might be enough to bring the characters to this strange place.

_**Dyolet Mounds (Mid Level).**_ Herwin Melvot (chaotic neutral, male, forest gnome [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) attempted to grow a new kind of dyolet with magic. His experiment resulted in shambling mounds made of dyolet plants that terrorize the Thicket. The gnomes allow the characters into the forest if the adventurers slay the plant monsters.
