### Velvin Thicket
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

**Population**:: 850 (98% [[gnomes]], 2% other [[races]])

**Government**:: The people of the Thicket are governed by a loose union between the leaders of the Velvins, the collection of local nomadic clans who convene only when threatened.

**Defense**:: While few are specifically trained for combat, many denizens of the Thicket are well-versed in illusion magic for self-defense.

**Commerce**:: Those that have the trust of the Velvins can acquire basic supplies, dyolet fruit, and the occasional unusual relic.

**Organizations**:: Scattered altars to the Wild Mother exist throughout the Thicket. Each of the seven nomadic clans handles its own internal affairs. Representatives from Pride's Call often visit for a time to maintain their relationship with the Velvin leaders.

Bordering the soggy fields of the [[Saltwallow Bog]] is the strange forest known as the Velvin Thicket. The nomadic gnomish clans that call these dense woods home have a loose network of allied families rather than a central township, and they defend their shaded sanctuary with illusions and enchantments. Because of the Velvins' trade agreement with Pride's Call, the dwarven city was able to request that the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] keep the thicket from becoming formally assimilated into Dwendalian society so long as the Velvins provided a small but consistent crop of dyolets. The dyolet fruit is a rare delicacy receptive to minor enchantments and only grows within the Velvin Thicket. The [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s interest in permitting Velvin autonomy has waned over the years, and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] is keen to take the Thicket under its jurisdiction and seize control of the dyolet crop.

The [[Gnomes|gnome]] families that live in the Velvin Thicket are suspicious of outsiders. The [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s interest in the area might be enough to bring the characters to this strange place.
