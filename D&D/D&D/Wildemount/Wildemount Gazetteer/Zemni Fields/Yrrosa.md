### Yrrosa
**Location**:: #Locale/[[Wildemount]]/ZemniFields 

**Population::** 3,220 

**Population Breakdown**:: 54% humans, 28% dwarves, 14% elves, 4% other races

**Government::** The Crown's will is imposed by Starosta Zulla Sauer, in tandem with the local noble families.

**Defense::** Yrrosa is protected by a battalion of [[Crownsguard]] supplemented by mercenaries.

**Commerce::** An older and smaller trade post, the town has basic equipment and supplies available for trade or purchase. Rooms and taverns are humble, but available.

**Organizations::** A temple to [[Bahamut]] looms over smaller shrines to the other empire-approved gods. [[The Myriad]] was once headquartered here; in its absence, the local businesses are entirely independent.

Once a snowy outpost between [[Icehaven]] and [[Rexxentrum]], Yrrosa has slowly grown into a sizable township where travelers and traders warm themselves as they pass through the frigid fields. The town is comprised of humble homesteads and numerous inns that promote themselves as "the hearth before the hoarfrost."

Recently, adventurers and fortune-seekers have flocked to the area to aid in the excavation of the nearby [[Ruins of Shattengrod]] (described earlier in this chapter).

Eighty years ago, a trapper guild turned smuggling gang was ousted from [[Icehaven]] and came to Yrrosa to seek better fortune. Life was no easier, and the crew of hungry rogues was forced to become creative. Noticing the lack of oversight from the empire, they began to build a network of like-minded individuals throughout [[Western Wynandir]]. Taking the name "[[the Myriad]]," they helmed illegal activity from the comfort of this small outpost town until fifteen years ago, when their base of operations was discovered and raided by imperial forces. The remaining Myriad leaders have scattered, but the shadow of their operation still looms over Yrrosa like a dark cloud.

The previous starosta, Stefan Weberrat, was arrested fifteen years ago for protecting [[the Myriad]]. His successor, Zulla Sauer, is the willful and respected daughter of Petrov Sauer, a mining baron in [[Druvenlode]]. She was chosen after she volunteered for the position, but unknown to most, she was already involved with the Myriad long before she became a starosta. She now helps inform their hidden network from a position of safety.

Petty crimes occur, but most stem from disagreements or competition over parties using Yrrosa as a base of operations while delving into the [[Ruins of Shattengrod]]. Unbeknownst to all but their allies, [[the Myriad]] has been slowly carving out new bases, and in time, they might grow bold enough to reclaim their old hideout.

Ramshackle wooden domiciles with snow-covered roofs line muddy streets throughout the town. The main roads were more improvised than planned, and most of the older buildings are in varying states of disrepair. Where Pride's Walk Road intersects with Havenpath Road is a cluster of taverns, inns, liveries, and stores.

The shadow of [[the Myriad]] hanging over Yrrosa makes it a fine place for intrigue, and the many travelers moving through the town have rumors and jobs to share with adventurers.
