**Commerce**:: Rexxentrum is the largest city in [[Wildemount]] and the seat of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s power, enabling massive volumes of trade in and out of the city. Most any goods, services, and places of business can be found within the city walls.

**Organizations**:: Grand temples to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods can be found throughout the city, while the most powerful guilds in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] vie for power and influence. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] takes an active role in political affairs, while the deep-rooted [[The Myriad|Myriad]] weaves tapestries of crime and corruption throughout the city.

The majestic capital of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] was founded in the year 514 PD. The central location and plentiful surrounding resources of the region made Rexxentrum the most favorable place to oversee the rule and expansion of the freshly established [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Over the next three centuries, Rexxentrum grew to become the largest city in [[Wildemount]], and the cultural and military center of [[Western Wynandir]].

At the core of all imperial politics are the nobles, politicians, and wealthy elite who live within the city or own property there. Grandiose displays of wealth and power are common among the inner wards, while sprawling poverty consumes the outer districts and slums beyond the protective walls of the city. Cobblestone streets twist and mingle through the bustling neighborhoods, cart merchants and street performers vying for the attention and patronage of passersby throughout the cold summer months and the even colder winter.

Glowing orbs of arcane fire flicker at the tops of dark iron lamp poles at major intersections, lighting the evening air, while colorful flowers adorn the inner archways of each neighborhood entryway. Buildings cluster close and reach toward the sky, often snow-dappled with long wooden slats placed between rooftops for riffraff to skitter across the city unseen. Although the city teems with life and activity, it is also full of lawkeepers and military watch, with griffon riders occasionally circling overhead above the ever-patrolling [[Crownsguard]] and the nearby [[Righteous Brand]] headquarters.

The massive and beautiful center for arcane study known as the [[Soltryce Academy]] is located in [[the Candles]], a thin crescent of a neighborhood marked by the tall and imposing tower homes of all eight leading members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], each unique and imposing in its own way. The beating heart of the city, and of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], lies positioned within the arc of [[the Candles]] in the terrace of [[Castle Ungebroch]]. From within the castle halls, King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] and his council of chosen authorities oversee all matters of state.

Much of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s prosperity over the centuries stems from the [[Cerberus Assembly]], a union of the nation's most powerful mages working directly for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. These arcane practitioners and scholars aid [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] in engaging foreign interests, in developing magical technology to better oversee the land and enforce his will, and making use of the rare relics that [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] confiscates from unearthed sites of pre-Calamity might. This arrangement affords the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] homes in [[the Candles]] and across the major cities of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], as well as access to every [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] political figure. Thus, members of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] are extremely influential and, by the nature of their arrangement, very carefully watched by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. Most civilians swap rumors of demonic pacts and demigod-level magics at the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]'s disposal, adding to their aura of mystique among the common folk. When an [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] mage walks the streets of Rexxentrum or attends the halls of an establishment within the city, it is an event that everyone will be talking about for days to come.

The resource-rich economy of Rexxentrum supports a powerful guild and merchant class, who work directly with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] under the watch of Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]]. Any permanent place of business is required to join a corresponding guild, paying an annual fee on top of their taxes to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], and to follow the guild's requirements for conditions of operations. Some complain that these conditions are often manipulated on a case-by-case basis to remove competition between similar interests, but cries of corruption within the guilds fall on deaf ears. This has led to a rapid growth of mobile businesses on street corners and shops that move between districts to avoid inspection by [[Crownsguard]] or guild members.

#### Politics and Persecution

Historically, public displays of unease under [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]'s rule were often met with brutal punishment. However, the previous king, [[Everard Dwendal]], loosened the laws applying to public discourse. This gave rise to a number of political figures who gathered the unhappy populace behind their philosophies. In response, King Everard established the [[Augen Trust]], a network of spies working for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] to blackmail or corrupt these politicians. With these high-profile dissenters under the thumb of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], controlling political discourse became easier, and politics within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] became a tense game of cat and mouse. Forthright nobles and frustrated guild heads unswayed by propaganda, gold, or threats still dissent publicly, testing the boundaries of their influence. King Bertrand's patience with public objections to his policies grows ever thinner, and he is enacting even more stringent laws against public criticism of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]].

In the wake of frustrated citizens, neglected concerns, and a clear caste system, the common folk of Rexxentrum are disenfranchised. The rallying call of war has brought some renewed imperial pride, but whispers of discontent have continued, coalescing into a small group of rebels within the capital that call themselves the Locksmiths. Wary of the history of failed rebellions in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], they gather information and gradually inspire the common folk to question authority, waiting for the right moment to ignite a revolution with a chance of success. With [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] distracted by war and the populace brimming with poverty and discontentment, that time might come sooner than anyone thinks.

King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] rules the capital himself. No [[starosta]] holds office within Rexxentrum. [[Prime Arbiter]] [[Sydnock Truscan]] oversees all major matters of law that do not require the attention of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], while Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]] works with the various guilds of the city to ensure smooth trade both within and beyond the walls of Rexxentrum. Beneath Sydnock is the head of Rexxentrum's [[Crownsguard]], Watchmaster Brunda Gleshin, who ensures that the laws of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] are enforced in the streets of the capital.

The capital city harbors a diverse criminal underground both within and beneath the streets. Surviving [[The Myriad|Myriad]] leaders remain hidden in plain sight throughout the city, including the beloved [[Iris Bethelas]], who is organizing the syndicate's return to power. Independent crime rings plague trade centers and busy districts where there are easy gold and gullible cityfolk. The populace is simply too large for the [[Crownsguard]] to oversee every corner of cobblestone where laws are bent or broken. Now, with the collective attention of the law focused on the war in the east, thieves and cutpurses are upping their game, and crime is on the rise within Rexxentrum.

The city spreads across the tallgrass fields south of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]], its walls forming a distended pentagon. Farmland around the north and east sides of the city are dotted with farmsteads and small rural communities that provide food for the capital. The northeast side of the wall curves around a trio of immense, fortified towers surrounded by barracks known as [[Bertrand Dwendal|the King]]'s Bastion, where the central force of the [[Righteous Brand]] military trains and resides. Within the outer walls of the city are seven major districts: the Mosaic Ward, the [[Mudtop Ward]], [[the Tangles]], the [[Shimmer Ward]], the [[Soltryce Academy]], [[the Candles]], and [[Castle Ungebroch Terrace]].

Near the southern end of [[the Tangles]] is the [[Vigil's Circle]], a marketplace built around a loop of road that surrounds the Tower of Writ, the temple to [[Erathis]] where the [[Prime Arbiter]] delivers his judgment. All manner of commerce takes place here, while the nearby [[Claykeep prison]] looms as an ominous reminder to any who might seek to break the laws of the land.

The Court of Colors, on the western edge of [[the Tangles]], is the largest of the three main plazas. The Court is a winding knot of streets, each of which is wholly dedicated to traders who come from far-off places to sell their exotic wares, while artists and performers bring an air of lively celebration despite the gray and dreary skies of the region. It's within this lively area that the Rexxentrum Archive of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] can be found. Near the southern wall of the [[Shimmer Ward]] is the [[Chantry of the Dawn]], the ancient temple to the [[Pelor|Dawn Father]] on which the city was originally founded, now restored and expanded into an awe-inspiring cathedral.

A noble house in Rexxentrum that isn't scheming for more power is a noble house in decline, or so the gentry believe. The city's officials and nobles have schemes to grab more money and power, and more than a few of the common folk have their own plots to launch themselves into positions of influence. Most of these social climbers need the help of adventurers willing to take risks, while others often need protection from their fellow schemers.
