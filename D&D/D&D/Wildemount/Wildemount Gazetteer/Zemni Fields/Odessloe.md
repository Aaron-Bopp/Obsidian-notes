### Odessloe
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

**Population**:: 6,970 (73% [[humans]], 12% [[elves]], 8% [[dwarves]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government**:: [[Starosta]] Vesdan Wothassic is eager to please [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and demands huge harvests from the fishers of Odessloe. As resentment builds, the few noble families who have business interests here work with Watchmaster Lein Untgaf to maintain order.

**Defense**:: A small cadre of [[Crownsguard]] watch over the city under the direction of the watchmaster.

**Commerce**:: As a popular trade stop on the way to the capital, Odessloe has many taverns and hostels. General stores provide basic supplies and occasionally offer strange relics pawned by cash-strapped adventurers.

**Organizations**:: The city harbors many small shrines to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods. Most businesses are run by locals but owned by absentee nobles. [[The Myriad]] has a quiet presence here.

Adjacent to the clear waters of the [[Erdeloch]], Odessloe is a prominent fishing and logging settlement, supplying [[Rexxentrum]] and the surrounding townships with fresh fish and lumber. The only major stop on the Cloakjaunt Path for those traveling between [[Bysaes Tyl]] and the capital, Odessloe also acts as a supply stop for traders and drifters moving through the shaded trees of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]].

The bounty provided by the [[Erdeloch]] is a source of local pride as well as the backbone of the local economy. The people of Odessloe are a superstitious lot, and many believe that the lake is home to a spirit that must be kept happy if they are to continue to receive its bountiful blessings. They leave offerings at the shores of the lake to appease this unseen entity. Imperial officials, including the [[starosta]], find this practice childish and actively dissuade citizens from indulging in "unlawful idol worship."

[[Starosta]] Vesdan Wothassic has held his position for a year, since the passing of the beloved [[Starosta]] Ruell. Vesdan has big shoes to fill and is eager to prove his worth to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. He has demanded resource yields from his citizens and enforced penalties on those who fail to meet his standards. Unsurprisingly, the people are already voicing their dissatisfaction with the new [[starosta]]. The nobles who profit from the local businesses grow worried that their investments are in danger â€” and are working with the watchmaster to try and suppress any talk of outright insurrection.

The city sees its small share of petty thefts and solitary criminal activity, but lacks the size and infrastructure to house an organized criminal element. This works to the advantage of [[The Myriad]], which has been using the rivers that connect to the [[Erdeloch]] as smuggling routes, with Odessloe acting as a hub for transactions and storage, all without the government's knowledge.

Built along the eastern shore of the [[Erdeloch]], this kidney-shaped city is comprised of three major areas. The muddy Lakeside region on the western end houses the docks, river-based storage buildings, and scattered housing for denizens of the district. Verdant and clean, the Greenset region on the eastern side of the settlement holds numerous logging camps and most of the residential homesteads for working families. The Crossmark region is the smaller center of the city, where the other regions meet at the juncture of the two largest thoroughfares, Cedarline Street and Hogmarshal Road. The smell of starchy foods and fresh fish suffuses the inns and market stalls of this sleepy intersection.

With [[The Myriad]] lurking in Odessloe, there are plenty of opportunities for characters who want to work for or against the organization. The settlement also makes an excellent base of operations for adventurers exploring the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]].
