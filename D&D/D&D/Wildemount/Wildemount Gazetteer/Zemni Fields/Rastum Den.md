Hidden among the [[Dunrock Mountains]], north of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]] and [[Rexxentrum]], is an encampment for breeding and training military griffons. These mighty beasts are used by the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] griffon riders of the [[Righteous Brand]], some of the best-respected soldiers in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Known as Rastum [[Den]], this moderately sized encampment is nestled in a small valley four thousand feet up in the mountains. The area's dizzying heights and tumultuous weather make it all but inaccessible to those without a griffon rider's prowess. This location was originally home to the largest griffon population in [[Wildemount]], making it natural terrain to quickly condition any young mounts bred for the [[Righteous Brand]].
