### Bysaes Tyl
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

**Population**:: 19,090 (83% [[elves]], 7% [[humans]], 10% other races)

**Government**:: The Ring of Three reluctantly cooperates with the appointed [[starosta]], Uther Prent, to govern the city. Exalted elven houses also work with the Ring of Three to preserve their culture under imperial rule.

**Defense**:: Both local and assigned [[Crownsguard]] stand ready to defend the city.

**Commerce**:: Nearly any equipment, goods, or services are available, though rarer supplies are generally kept from non-elven travelers.

**Organizations**:: While smaller temples dedicated to the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods are present, shrines to [[Corellon]], [[Melora]], and [[Sehanine]] hide in plain sight. The beginnings of [[The Myriad|Myriad]] influence are taking hold.

The rustic elven city of Bysaes Tyl is tucked away in the northern region of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]]. Built synergistically within the tangled boreal forests, this hidden settlement of tall wooden arches and warm hearths sits below a massive network of treehouses and bridges that form the canopy and upper levels of the city. The streets are made of smooth stones set in packed earth, gently enchanted to warm the pathways and melt the frequent snow. Large, bowed tutoring halls hold lectures for the masses, while cleared patches of forest facilitate the training of warriors in the defense of both the city and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Bysaes Tyl was founded by [[elves]] who fled the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]] in the [[Savalirwood]] and quietly began to build a new home away from the eyes of the expanding [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The [[elves]] of Bysaes Tyl struggled through the harsh winters for many years as they constructed their homestead, leaving the past behind to look to the future of their society. Adversity bred a hard, guarded, and tight-knit people.

When [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] discovered that an independent city-state had formed within imperial territory, an imperial envoy was dispatched to present the [[elves]] with an ultimatum: accept Dwendalian rule or prepare for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to claim sovereignty over Bysaes Tyl by force. The Ring of Three, the elven elders, convened and agreed not to fight. Many of their kind would die in a senseless war — and perhaps the [[elves]] would outlive their imperial rulers many years hence. They agreed to submit and follow imperial laws and pay imperial taxes, under the condition that they could maintain some level of cultural autonomy within their city.

The [[elves]] guard the secrets of their culture as best they can, maintaining a tenuous relationship with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] that holds to this day.

Bysaes Tyl remains the only city of elven creation within the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The denizens feel an intense need to protect and maintain their cultural legacy, and to search for clues surrounding the mysterious destruction of their ancestral home. As per the agreement between Bysaes Tyl and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], the Ring of Three has incorporated some elements of imperial society into their own and shared a number of arcane secrets and recovered artifacts from [[Molaesmyr]] with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] in exchange for their city's cultural autonomy. The [[elves]] wish to preserve their unique art and music, their crafting skills and techniques, and knowledge gleaned from the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] that might decide the future of their people. The rumors that secrets and relics within Bysaes Tyl still remain hidden from [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] heighten the tension between the [[starosta]] and the Ring of Three, in addition to the slowly increasing imperial oversight.

As part of the agreement that brought the city into the fold of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], the Ring of Three, comprised of the elven nobles Allusus Dawyne, Gwey Yethneiros, and Amra Balleei, still oversee most aspects of city life. They must, however, work very closely with [[Starosta]] Uther Prent and his appointed counselors when governing the infrastructure and enforcement of law and order. Uther's prejudice against [[elves]] is well-known throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and many believe this is why he was chosen for his position. The Ring of Three continues to deftly undermine Uther's leadership while simultaneously stroking his ego, a dance that they have thus far executed with grace but which cannot continue forever.

The [[elves]] of the city rarely engage in criminal activity, but escalating theft and brutality from non-elven imperial citizens living within — or passing through — Bysaes Tyl is a problem that the [[starosta]] largely ignores. Agents of the scattered [[The Myriad|Myriad]] have offered to help the Ring of Three manipulate the [[starosta]] and his council. The Ring of Three are weighing the benefits of letting an unlawful organization into their midst to help their oppressed people against the long-term consequences of working with such untrustworthy allies.

The city exists partially on the forest floor and partially within and around the trees, giving the settlement an air of rustic nostalgia that tempers its elven mystique. The walled surface streets are known as the Rough, or _Talan_, where structures weave between rocks and wide-trunked trees, giving a slanted octagonal shape to the tall, wooden exterior walls of the city. Nearly all structures here are built from pine and other taiga trees, favoring designs that resemble a bowed arch rising to an apex. Spiraling staircases known as the Shrouds, or _Halya_, twist around and within trees, climbing up to the elevated walkways and buildings amid the forest canopy.

The tension between [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[elves]] in Bysaes Tyl plays a part in any of the city's adventures. [[Elves]] trying to maintain their cultural connection with nature and their lost homeland of [[Molaesmyr]] could look to adventurers for aid, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] could use help keeping the peace, and [[the Myriad]] could hire the characters to infiltrate the city.
