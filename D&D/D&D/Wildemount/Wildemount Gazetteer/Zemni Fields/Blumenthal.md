### Blumenthal

**Population:** 3,850 (71% [[humans]], 12% [[dwarves]], 11% [[elves]], 6% other races)

**Government:** Starosta Judus Olessia is the appointed leader of Blumenthal, but the countless directives from [[Rexxentrum]] often bypass him entirely.

**Defense:** A respectable cadre of [[Crownsguard]] and a small body of Righteous Brand soldiers keep the farmsteads of Blumenthal safe.

**Commerce:** While food, produce, and basic supplies are available, little else can be found since most trade heads straight to the capital.

**Organizations:** A temple to [[Pelor]] stands vigil over the heart of the farmland. The farming guilds all work under the strict expectations of the Crown.

A sprawling collection of rural farmsteads connected by administration buildings, Blumenthal is [[Rexxentrum]]'s main source of produce and meat. Numerous government-owned fields and orchards harvest cold-weather crops and livestock, and families chosen to tend to the land are paid by the Crown to gather their goods and deliver them to the gates of the capital. Some who till the land are frustrated that they don't own their plots outright, but with generational incentives for those who keep to the family plot like their ancestors, others see it as investment toward eventually living in greater comfort than the typical farmer.

As [[Rexxentrum]]'s survival depends on Blumenthal's fields, the Crown has erected dozens of [[Crownsguard]] watchtowers at the corner farmers' plots to watch for thieves, scavengers, and monstrous predators. The people of Blumenthal can't help but feel the watchful eye of the Crown on them at all times, looming over their work and dampening their spirits. Yet even in such troubled times, Starosta Judus Olessia works directly with [[Argonomist June Wiston]] to improve the lives of the hard-working farmers who support the success of Blumenthal â€” and thus of the empire.

Since Blumenthal's fields are critical to the survival of the people of [[Rexxentrum]], adventurers might be hired by the empire to investigate disappearing or dying animals or crops, or to stop monster raids from the [[Silberquel Ridge]]. Adventurers who work for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] could be asked to destroy crops or poison goods headed for Rexxentrum.

_**Bad Beef (Low Level).**_ Tainted beef from three different cattle farms in Blumenthal has killed several people in [[Rexxentrum]]. [[Crownsguard]] investigators concluded that the meat was intentionally poisoned and hire the characters to find the culprits. Why hire outsiders? The Crownsguard in Blumenthal is on the list of suspects, since they escorted the meat to Rexxentrum. Of course, the list of suspects doesn't stop there. Did the farmers work together because they abhor living under imperial rule? Is there an agent of the Kryn within Blumenthal? Is someone using enchantment magic from afar to make farmhands poison beef? One thing is for sure: the culprits are willing to kill and won't come quietly.
