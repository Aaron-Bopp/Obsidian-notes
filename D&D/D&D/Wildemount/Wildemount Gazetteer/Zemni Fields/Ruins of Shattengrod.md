This sinkhole is a rocky pit measuring roughly thirty feet across and sixty feet deep. Littered with ancient bones, the pit was long considered just a macabre curiosity, referred to by the [[dwarves]] of Pride's Call as the Grave Hole. When tales of the strange location reached inquiring minds within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], an investigation was launched. Beneath the pit, explorers discovered the sundered ruins of a prominent city from the [[Age of Arcanum]] called Shattengrod. Heavy excavation expanded the pit into a spiraling hole that delves into the subterranean city, unveiling broken relics and forgotten secrets â€” as well as some enduring shades and hungry entities now awakened. The promise of beneficial discoveries pushes both interests of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] to delve into the ruins, but the deaths of mercenaries are already drawing attention as rumors of the dangers below spread and scare off many possible hires.
