A major stop along the Glory Run Road heading eastward from the capital, Nogvurot hosts travelers making their way through the empire, many of whom need provisions and like to buy locally made trinkets as souvenirs of their journey. There is some business to be had in a small mine at the base of the [[Dunrock Mountains]] to the north of the city, but most Nogvurot folk earn their keep by crafting, farming, or joining the local military.

Originally founded as a guard post near the Quannah Breach to watch for deadly creatures wandering from the [[Savalirwood]], this settlement has since grown to be a fair-sized military reserve for the Righteous Brand. The regiment of the Righteous Brand stationed within the city would be the defending army against any assault headed for the capital, granting them the title of the last Aegis. Nearly half of the city's population is military reserve, with just over six thousand troops present at any given time. The bored or restless soldiers, seeking distraction and entertainment, developed the barracks of the Aegis Block into a place of sport and competitive game, often with impressive amounts of coin wagered on the outcomes. However, between reports of the Kryn taking the [[Ashguard Garrison]] and rumors of unexplained Kryn attacks within the [[Marrow Valley]] itself, the Aegis is very much on edge.

Starosta Brumae Luddie, a retired general of the Righteous Brand, has watched over the city for fifteen years. Brumae is driven by a strong sense of duty and pride in the empire, never questioning the words of the king. Because Brumae is regarded by most as a fair and just starosta, some fear that his advanced age will soon bring an end to his tenure and allow less-scrupulous figures to vie for his position.

The strong military presence within Nogvurot keeps petty crime within the city to a minimum. Unfortunately, the [[Crownsguard]] often puff out their chests and try to one-up the soldiers of the Righteous Brand â€” and some local criminals have taken advantage of this petty rivalry to keep the soldiers distracted and continue their criminal behavior unimpeded.

Corruption is also becoming a problem, as Last Aegis soldiers use their sway within the city to make easy coin by turning a blind eye to smuggling to and from [[Shadycreek Run]] and other criminal hotspots in the [[Greying Wildlands]].

The oblong city is divided between the eastern Aegis Block, which houses the bulk of the stationed soldiers, and the western region of the city that is broken into two sectors: the northern Scatters and the southern Peddler's Row. The Scatters is the larger region, housing dive taverns, simple temples, and a majority of the populace, who live in numerous neighborhoods of rickety domiciles. In contrast, Peddler's Row is a bustling home to local craft guilds and a colorful, if muddy, marketplace where the Glory Run Road passes through the city.

Characters could go to Nogvurot to find someone in the city or to join the Righteous Brand. The city is also a good place for adventurers looking to test their mettle in competitive games against trained soldiers.
