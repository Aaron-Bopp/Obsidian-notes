### Kaltenloch

The harsh winters in the region cause the Kaltenloch to remain frozen over for three to four months out of the year, but the cold lake provides fish to the community of [[Icehaven]] year-round. With the ice comes a mysterious low mist that many say is made up of the spirits of fallen Calamity soldiers, looking for warmth to steal.
