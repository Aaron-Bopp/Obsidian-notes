### Incanter's Rest
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Blightshore
**Location**:: [[Blightshore]]

This Calamity-era battlefield is now a massive graveyard haunted by the undead spirits of unnameable horrors and their cruel, unending vengeance. Named after the unknown mage who brought this region's struggle to its devastating conclusion, Incanter's Rest has few landmarks other than the gigantic skeletal remains of three monstrous titans, which reverently tower above the area's dusty steppes. Howling winds perpetually sweep the Rest with ghostly ardor, while ramshackle monuments of rusted weapons and armor sporadically mark the graves of the fallen.

Some historians speculate that Incanter's Rest is actually the amalgamated site of multiple conflicts, while others claim that it was the most massive battlefield [[Wildemount]] has ever seen. No matter the cause, the grave-strewn fields of Incanter's Rest are seeded with powerful necromantic energies that many unscrupulous mages seek to exploit.
