### Olc Skerry

Legends say the people of Olc Skerry were either slaughtered by outlanders or claimed by a virulent contagion. Learned sages, however, suggest that the inhabitants of this island hamlet abandoned it long ago and journeyed into the mainlands of the Far Hharom peninsula. The nature of this exodus remains a mystery, but relics found scattered among Olc Skerry's crumbling wooden hovels and tenebrous seaside caves suggest the people of the village revered an unnamed pantheon of forgotten entities from the Far Realm. Modern explorers who return from expeditions to Olc Skerry tell stories of pernicious phantoms who poison the mind with madness, and blood-hungry wolves that lurk among the island's dark and craggy woodlands.

Olc Skerry is a spooky, abandoned settlement sure to raise the hackles of even the most jaded explorer.

_**Ol' Bucket Helm (Low Level).**_ Flocks of black gulls haunt the lonely north shores of the island, congregating around a seaside cave that attracts ordinary crabs and a few giant crabs as well. Just outside the cave mouth, someone has planted a grim scarecrow with a rusted bucket helm for a head, and anyone who tampers with the helm causes the black gulls to form into three hostile swarms (use the [swarm of ravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-ravens) stat block in appendix A of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")). The gulls also gather into swarms at the command of the cave's reclusive occupant, Peggy Silva, a sea hag with snails in her hair who wears an old fishing net as a shawl. A deranged kuo-toa whip named Plookoolp is the only company Peggy Silva tolerates.

_**Black Sap (Mid Level).**_ Visitors to Olc Skerry can't help but notice an old stone windmill perched atop a rocky hill just south of town, its four spindly vanes stripped to their wooden bones. Behind the crumbling, desolate structure grows a large death's head willow, from which characters can extract 20 doses of black sap (see the "[Blightshore Contraband](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-blightshore#BlightshoreContraband "Blightshore Contraband")" sidebar earlier in this chapter). The black sap is worth a small fortune in the black markets of Rotthold. However, the windmill is home to an oni that doesn't take kindly to the sap's theft.
