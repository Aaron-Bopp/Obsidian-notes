### Cauldron Sea

A perpetual storm chokes the stony shores of this dark and brackish expanse, where aspects of the Elemental Plane of Water and the Abyss collide in constant entropic turmoil. Aquatic terrors lurk in its murky fathoms, which are rumored to hold everything from the ruined battlements of a sunken city to the haunted graveyard of a forgotten fleet.

Although the waters of the Cauldron Sea present challenges to those who would tame its tides, a handful of unmapped (and often unnamed) villages are scattered along its savage shores. Some of these settlements offer safe havens to weary travelers of the northern Strand, prospectors and pirates alike, but most treat outsiders with disdain or even outright hostility.

Soothsayers claim that [[Tharizdun]], created the Cauldron Sea to loosen the veil between worlds and warn that one day he will rend the very fabric of reality from the depths of its accursed waters. There are those who would see this mad prophecy fulfilled, but many more would do anything to prevent the [[Betrayer God]]'s malevolent return.

Cauldron Sea

The tumultuous waters of the Cauldron Sea breed all manner of creatures and crises for intrepid characters to overcome.

_**Presage in a Bottle (Mid Level).**_ Unlike the restorative essences of the [[Sorrowseep Waters]], a draught of liquid from the Cauldron Sea is said to induce madness along with various other arcane effects. A world-class alchemist and chirurgeon, the eccentric Brannon Ven Brava, seeks to analyze the primordial liquid's supernatural essence firsthand and will pay handsomely for an escort through the wilds of [[Blightshore]] to secure it.
