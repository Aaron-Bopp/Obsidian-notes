### Ghor Veles
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Blightshore
**Location**:: [[Blightshore]]

The ruined keep at the heart of this crumbling city once served as an arcane repository and research facility for the Betrayer Gods during their pre-Calamity ascent to power. Artifacts and wondrous items from the [[Age of Arcanum]] are rumored to linger within its shadow-haunted vaults, lying in wait for those brave or foolish enough to challenge the citadel's timeless guardians. Now, its decaying battlements stand as a stark monument to [[the Calamity]]'s unstoppable devastation.

The name Ghor Veles means "Vault of Shadows," and a vast dungeon indeed lurks below the ruins of the city. These catacombs were home to the aberrant and undead minions of the dracolich Oracs the Enduring. Countless adventuring parties and would-be tomb robbers have attempted to lay siege to the vaults below Ghor Veles, only to perish at the clawed hands and creeping doom of the keep's fearsome inhabitants. But a destiny worse than death awaits them: most of these ill-fated interlopers become undead minions themselves, bound to Oracs in unending servitude. As this army grows, so does Oracs's hold over the [[Miskath Strand]].

#### Land of Refugees and Hermits

Ghor Veles is pockmarked by crumbling houses and dilapidated fortresses, and countless people displaced from elsewhere in [[Xhorhas]] by war or exile have made this blighted battlefield their home. A notable resident of the ruins surrounding Ghor Veles is a [[dranassar]] survivor named Liv-Burrath. She uses magic to disguise herself as a [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] to avoid attracting attention, but is covertly collecting arcane relics from Ghor Veles with the hope that she can one day reunite with other [[dranassar]] and retake their ancient home of Ghor Dranas. She pays a fair sum for any artifacts that adventurers gather from the ruins.

Only the undead horrors beneath Ghor Veles rival the cutthroat grave robbers that characters might encounter among the crumbling ruins.
