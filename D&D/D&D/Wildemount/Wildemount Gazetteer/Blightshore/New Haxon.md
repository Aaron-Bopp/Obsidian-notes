### New Haxon

**Population:** 1,250 (70% humans, 20% dragonborn, 10% other races)

**Government:** The [[Cerberus Assembly]] works in tandem with allied mercenaries to maintain a stratocracy of lawful military power.

**Defense:** Satyana Vorvexis, an adult copper dragon, commands a garrison of over two hundred active duty soldiers, and each citizen of New Haxon is enlisted for reserve military duty.

**Commerce:** Common goods and services are available via the city's vast network of enterprising military merchants. Meanwhile, the [[Cerberus Assembly]] strives to subvert New Haxon's thriving and profitable black market for rare arcane antiquities.

**Organizations:** Although the [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s sages hold power here, various mercenary guilds from remote corners of [[Wildemount]] have also made New Haxon their base of operations. The city has become an unlikely haven for esoteric cults of the Betrayer Gods and other dark entities.

Whatever disaster befell Old Haxon is a tale lost to time and [[the Calamity]]. In its place, a fair-weather confederation of humans and dragonborn have erected this lone bastion. The stalwart outpost of New Haxon is garrisoned by agents of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], along with a contingent of allied mercenaries from nearby [[Draconia]]. An amalgam of crumbling ruins and modern battlements, New Haxon serves as the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s only trusted waypoint for "civilized" exploration throughout [[Blightshore]]'s savage badlands.

The adult copper dragon Satyana Vorvexis commands New Haxon's threadbare legion of soldiers with a healthy measure of cunning and inventiveness. In addition to her military prowess, Satyana's draconic predilections and experience in the field have earned her a reputation as one of Wynandir's foremost curators and collectors of arcane relics. Some members of the assembly (and their imperial patrons) question the chaotic dragon's true intentions, but the people of New Haxon would be hard pressed to find a more competent leader to navigate the region's tumultuous history and enduring threats.

Among its other mysteries, Old Haxon is rumored to be the site of one of the lost vaults of [[Vecna]], where the lich hid countless [[magic items]] of awesome power and ill intent. Whether or not this arcane storehouse is merely the stuff of legend remains to be seen, but its presence would certainly explain the [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s keen interest in Haxon's wayward history.

Characters who adventure in New Haxon are likely conscripts, volunteers, or opponents of the local stratocracy's oppressive military force.

_**Right Side of Wrong (Low Level).**_ As dutiful servants of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], the characters are tasked with ridding a local safe house of cult activity. But the operation doesn't go according to plan: one of the [cultists](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cultist) is the teenage son of a prominent assembly official, and the characters must decide whether they will shine a light on his indiscretion or bury it at the potential cost of becoming accomplices themselves.

_**Plunder the Crypt (Mid Level).**_ A high elf mastermind, Drahir Baiegn, hires the characters to masquerade as [[Cerberus Assembly]] agents and plunder a notorious vault below New Haxon: the Amethyst Crypt. When they infiltrate the vault, however, the characters discover they've been duped by Baiegn, who sacrifices his disposable agents to feed an abhorrent arcane construct deep within the inescapable tomb.

_**Eater of Worlds (High Level).**_ The characters are summoned to a meeting with Satyana Vorvexis. One of the dragon's spies managed to infiltrate a cult operating within the city and determined that its leaders are preparing a ritual to summon Shothotugg, the Eater of Worlds (see the "[Elder Evils of Exandria](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary/#sidebarElderEvilsOfExandria "Elder Evils of [[Exandria]]")" sidebar in chapter 7). Shothotugg's arrival would almost certainly place New Haxon in jeopardy. The cult controls a crumbling dungeon complex below the ruins of Old Haxon. The cult's leaders are a pair of [vampires](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) aided by a small conclave of [cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cloaker), but most of the cult members are nihilistic humanoids and [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn).
