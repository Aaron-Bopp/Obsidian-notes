### New Haxon
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Blightshore
**Location**:: [[Blightshore]]

**Population**:: 1,250 (70% [[humans]], 20% [[dragonborn]], 10% other races)

**Government**:: The [[Cerberus Assembly]] works in tandem with allied mercenaries to maintain a stratocracy of lawful military power.

**Defense**:: Satyana Vorvexis, an adult copper dragon, commands a garrison of over two hundred active duty soldiers, and each citizen of New Haxon is enlisted for reserve military duty.

**Commerce**:: Common goods and services are available via the city's vast network of enterprising military merchants. Meanwhile, the [[Cerberus Assembly]] strives to subvert New Haxon's thriving and profitable black market for rare arcane antiquities.

**Organizations**:: Although the [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s sages hold power here, various mercenary guilds from remote corners of [[Wildemount]] have also made New Haxon their base of operations. The city has become an unlikely haven for esoteric cults of the Betrayer Gods and other dark entities.

Whatever disaster befell Old Haxon is a tale lost to time and [[the Calamity]]. In its place, a fair-weather confederation of [[humans]] and [[dragonborn]] have erected this lone bastion. The stalwart outpost of New Haxon is garrisoned by agents of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], along with a contingent of allied mercenaries from nearby [[Draconia]]. An amalgam of crumbling ruins and modern battlements, New Haxon serves as the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s only trusted waypoint for "civilized" exploration throughout [[Blightshore]]'s savage badlands.

The adult copper dragon Satyana Vorvexis commands New Haxon's threadbare legion of soldiers with a healthy measure of cunning and inventiveness. In addition to her military prowess, Satyana's draconic predilections and experience in the field have earned her a reputation as one of Wynandir's foremost curators and collectors of arcane relics. Some members of the assembly (and their imperial patrons) question the chaotic dragon's true intentions, but the people of New Haxon would be hard pressed to find a more competent leader to navigate the region's tumultuous history and enduring threats.

Among its other mysteries, Old Haxon is rumored to be the site of one of the lost vaults of [[Vecna]], where the lich hid countless [[magic items]] of awesome power and ill intent. Whether or not this arcane storehouse is merely the stuff of legend remains to be seen, but its presence would certainly explain the [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s keen interest in Haxon's wayward history.

Characters who adventure in New Haxon are likely conscripts, volunteers, or opponents of the local stratocracy's oppressive military force.
