## Greying Wildlands
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/GreyingWildlands 
**Location**:: [[Wildemount Gazetteer]]
Pressed against the northeastern coast of Wynandir is a desert of ice and snow, separated from the [[Dwendalian Empire]] by the jagged [[Dunrock Mountains]] and the Quannah Breach. This landscape of dense, desiccated forests, rolling mountains, and icy tundra is known as the Greying Wildlands, the southern part of the [[Biting North]] that encompasses this region as well as the [[islands of Eiselcross]]. The [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] has struggled to expand into the region, leaving its denizens to focus on their own survival in the harsh territory, where wandering outlanders and barbarous hunters stalk the unchecked wilderness. Tucked beyond the edge of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s reach, past the shadowed dangers of the dense, frozen foliage, lies the dwarven citadel of [[Uthodurn]], which has become the home of many [[elves]] who survived the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]].
