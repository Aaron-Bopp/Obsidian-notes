### Prosthetic Limb

(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/prosthetic-limb)

_Wondrous item, common_

This item replaces a lost limb—a hand, an arm, a foot, a leg, or a similar body part. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces. You can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against your will. It detaches if you die.
