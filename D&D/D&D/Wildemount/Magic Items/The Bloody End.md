Carrying the power of [[Bane]], this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

[The Bloody End](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/the-bloody-end) is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and [[Infernal]].

A tyrannical [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pit-fiend) named Izeelzee lives within [The Bloody End](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/the-bloody-end). The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn’t demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

-   You can speak, read, and write [[Infernal]].
-   You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
-   While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person), [dominate person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-person), or [fear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fear). Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dawn.
-   While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Intimidation)) checks.

When the morningstar reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

-   The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.
-   The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar increases to 15.
-   When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using [The Bloody End](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/the-bloody-end), you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) of you until the end of your next turn. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
-   When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 psychic damage to the attacker.

When the morningstar reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

-   The weapon’s bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.
-   Add [dominate monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dominate-monster) to the list of spells that can be cast from the morningstar.
-   The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar, as well as for creatures to avoid being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) by it, increases to 17.
-   When you use your reaction to deal psychic damage to a creature that hits you with a melee attack, the amount of psychic damage increases to 2d6.
