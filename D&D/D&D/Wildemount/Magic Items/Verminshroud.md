(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/verminshroud)

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

This patchy cloak was pieced together from the pelts of rats found feasting on the dead in [[Blightshore]] and is dotted with the bloated corpses of magically preserved insects along its seams.

While wearing the [verminshroud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/verminshroud) in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks that rely on smell, you are immune to disease, and you have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision), wearing the cloak increases the range of your [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) by 60 feet.
-   As an action, you can use the [verminshroud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/verminshroud) to cast [polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph) on yourself, transforming into a [giant rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-rat) or [rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rat) while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as the properties of the cloak. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

-   You have resistance to poison damage.
-   You can use an action to cast the [insect plague](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/insect-plague) spell (save DC 15) from the [verminshroud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/verminshroud), requiring no material components. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

-   You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
-   Your teeth become razor-sharp natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

When you bite a creature and deal damage to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
