### Amulet of the Drunkard
(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/amulet-of-the-drunkard)

_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This amulet smells of old, ale-stained wood. While wearing it, you can regain 4d4 + 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer, ale, mead, or wine. Once the amulet has restored hit points, it canâ€™t do so again until the next dawn.
