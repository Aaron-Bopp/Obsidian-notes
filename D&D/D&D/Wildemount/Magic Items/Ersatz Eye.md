### Ersatz Eye

(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ersatz-eye)

_Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)_

This artificial eye replaces a real one that was lost or removed. While the [ersatz eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ersatz-eye) is embedded in your eye socket, it canâ€™t be removed by anyone other than you, and you can see through the tiny orb as though it were a normal eye.
