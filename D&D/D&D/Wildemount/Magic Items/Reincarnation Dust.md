### Reincarnation Dust

(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/reincarnation-dust)

_Wondrous item, very rare_

When this small pouch of purple dust is sprinkled on a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid, the dust is absorbed by the remains. If willing, the dead creature returns to life with a new body as if the [reincarnate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/reincarnate) spell had been cast on the remains.
