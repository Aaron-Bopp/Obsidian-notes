While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

When [Danoth’s visor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/danoths-visor) reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

-   You see [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) creatures and objects within 60 feet of you as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.
-   As a bonus action, you can speak a command word and use the goggles to see into and through solid matter. This vision has a radius of 60 feet and lasts for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
-   As a bonus action, you can speak a command word to switch the goggles into spyglass mode. While in this mode, creatures and objects viewed through the goggles are magnified to twice their size. Speaking the command word again reverts the goggles to their normal operation.

When [Danoth’s Visor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/danoths-visor) reaches an exalted state, it gains the following properties:

-   You automatically detect illusions you can see and automatically succeed on saving throws against them. In addition, you see a bright aura around any creature that isn’t in its true form.
-   As an action, you can cast the [antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field) spell from the visor. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
