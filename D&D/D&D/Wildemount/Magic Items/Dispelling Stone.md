### Dispelling Stone

(https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/dispelling-stone)

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This smooth, rainbow-colored, egg-shaped stone can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere of magical energy on impact, destroying the stone. Any active spell of 5th level or lower in the sphere ends.
