_Wondrous item, uncommon_

This reddish brown dust can be sprinkled over any edible substance to greatly improve the flavor. The dust also dulls the eaterâ€™s senses: anyone eating food treated with this dust has disadvantage on Wisdom ability checks and Wisdom saving throws for 1 hour. There is enough dust to flavor six servings.
