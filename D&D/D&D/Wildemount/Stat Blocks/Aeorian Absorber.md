### Aeorian Absorber

Resembling some sort of canine or feline quadruped at a distance, the absorber’s monstrous nature becomes quickly apparent as it closes in. Named for its ability to draw magical energy into its body, the absorber can release that energy in devastating blasts through its tail, whose eye is constantly on the lookout for prey.

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The absorber has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

_**Pounce.**_ If the absorber moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits its claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the target is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone), the absorber can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The absorber makes three attacks: one with its bite or Mind Bolt and two with its claws.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) force damage.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.

_**Mind Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 22 (4d10) psychic damage.

Reactions

_**Tail Ray.**_ When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
