### Aeorian Nullifier

Nullifiers are the [[bane]] of all magic users, with their physical forms and innate powers shaped specifically to resist and cancel magical effects. Against other foes, a nullifier is no less fearsome for the grotesque mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth that cover its torso—and which set up a cacophony of gnashing that can drive other creatures mad.

_**Horrid Gnashing.**_ The nullifier’s mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:

**1–4:** The creature is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned) until the end of the turn.

**5–6:** The creature is [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier.

**7–8:** The creature doesn’t move, and it uses its action to make one melee attack against a random creature (other than itself) if one is within reach. It otherwise does nothing.

_**Innate Spellcasting.**_ The nullifier’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _[counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell)_ (see “Reactions” below), _[detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic)_, _[dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic)_, _[see invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility)_

1/day: _**[antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field)**_

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The nullifier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The nullifier makes three attacks: one with its bites and two with its claws.

_**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage, and the target is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 16) if it’s a creature. The nullifier has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

Reactions

_**Counterspell.**_ The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
