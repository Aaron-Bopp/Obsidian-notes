## Wildemount NPCs

[Appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/nonplayer-characters "Monster Manual - Appendix B") of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") contains stat blocks that can be used to represent most nonplayer characters (NPCs) in Wildemount. You can modify these stat blocks to give NPCs features similar to the character options in [chapter 4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/character-options-subclasses "chapter 4") of this book. For example, you can create an NPC dunamancer by taking the archmage or mage stat block in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") and replacing some of its spells with new spells from chapter 4, or you can take the knight or veteran stat block and add a trait similar to the Manifest Echo class feature of the Echo Knight in chapter 4.
