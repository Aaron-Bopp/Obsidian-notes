## Aeorian Hunters

Brought to life by mages in the flying city of [[Aeor]] during the [[Age of Arcanum]], Aeorian hunters were created to take on angels, demons, devils, fey, and the gods themselves. When [[Aeor]] crashed into [[Eiselcross]], many of these magically mutated monstrosities survived, and they now stalk [[Aeor]]’s ruins and the islands’ icy wastes.

**_Created by Experimentation._** Aeorian hunters were created through arcane experimentation on beasts and humanoids—both captives and volunteers. These experiments resulted in monstrosities with brightly colored flesh and the power to resist and destroy [[Aeor]]’s enemies. It is theorized that the mages of [[Aeor]] must have possessed some means of controlling their monstrous soldiers, but no such device has yet been found in the wastes of [[Eiselcross]]. Draconic was the language used by these mages to train and bind the Aeorian hunters, and the hunters retain an understanding of this language even though they can’t speak it.

**_Madness through Immortality._** Aeorian hunters do not age. As such, the lust for violence their creators instilled in their minds has grown ravenous after centuries without war. Most immediately attack any creature they see.

**_Never Harm Another Hunter._** Though they crave violence, Aeorian hunters have never been seen attacking each other. Most scholars believe that [[Aeor]]’s mages must have enchanted this behavior into them, given the cost in gold and magic required to create each hunter. Some adventurers in [[Eiselcross]] boast about sneaking past Aeorian hunters using disguises or illusions to mimic a hunter’s form, but these are most likely tall tales.

**_Ageless Memories._** Each Aeorian hunter has perfect recall of every experience since the moment of its creation. Their limited intellects and desire for violence prevent them from effectively communicating, but each hunter holds a wealth of knowledge—often including the location of rare Aeorian relics—inside its mind.

**_Perfect Soldiers._** Aeorian hunters don’t require food or drink.
