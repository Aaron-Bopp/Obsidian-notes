### A [[Sea Fury]]’s Lair

A [[sea fury]] lurks in the caverns where its coven once dwelled, decorating the walls with the bones of its slain kin, as well as baubles stolen from sunken wrecks.

A [[sea fury]] encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the [[sea fury]] can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects, but can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

-   Caverns, tunnels, and pools of water within 120 feet of the [[sea fury]] become foggy or murky, to the extent that the area becomes heavily obscured.
-   The [[sea fury]] conjures a 15-foot cube of water that fills an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it, then moves the water in a straight line up to 60 feet, after which the water disperses. Any creature that comes into contact with the rushing wave must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) by it and pushed 15 feet along its course.
-   The [[sea fury]] calls forth the spirit of a dead sailor or sea hag that met its end in the lair. This spirit has the statistics of a [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/specter) and lasts until the [[sea fury]] uses another lair action. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the [[sea fury]] and obeys the sea fury’s commands.

The region containing a [[sea fury]]’s lair is warped by the [[sea fury]]’s magic, which creates the following effects:

-   Sea water within 5 miles of the lair becomes coarse and choppy, as if whipped by an unseen wind.
-   Sea grass within 1 mile of the lair is imbued with a foul mockery of life, grasping ineffectually at any creature that passes within 5 feet of it.
-   Ordinary crabs and octopi within 1 mile of the lair grow in size to become [giant crabs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-crab) and [giant octopi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-octopus), respectively. These creatures serve the [[sea fury]] as spies and guards.
