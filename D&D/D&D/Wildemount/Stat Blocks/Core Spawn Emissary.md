### Core Spawn Emissary

These airborne predators serve as assassins and sentinels for the core spawn. The terrible thrum of its insectoid wings and a chittering of mandibles announces an emissary’s arrival.

The core spawn emissary can expel clouds of crystalline spores from tubes in its head. These spores act like a contact poison and can be deadly if inhaled.
