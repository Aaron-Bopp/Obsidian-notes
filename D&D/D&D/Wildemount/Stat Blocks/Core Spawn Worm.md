### [[Core Spawn]] Worm

This invertebrate horror has quivering, barbed tentacles set around its massive, toothy maw. The worm’s cracked and stony hide pulses with a dull orange glow, as if it might be composed of primordial lava perpetually on the verge of hardening into solid rock.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The worm makes two attacks: one with its barbed tentacles and one with its bite.

_**Barbed Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 25 (5d6 + 8) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained). The tentacles can grapple only one creature at a time.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 30 (5d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) and [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).
