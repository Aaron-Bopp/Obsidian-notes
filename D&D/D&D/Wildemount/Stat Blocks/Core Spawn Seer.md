[[Core spawn]] seers are humanoid arcanists corrupted by the eldritch power of the [[Elder Evils]] through blasphemous rites or accursed encounters. Ravaged by otherworldly radiation and disease, their bodies are covered in horrible protrusions of fluorescent crystals, which emit a psychedelic glow from beneath the tattered folds of their robes.
