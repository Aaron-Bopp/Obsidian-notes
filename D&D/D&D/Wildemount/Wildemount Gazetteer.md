> The beauty and danger of [[Wildemount]] are all but lost on a party of adventurers traversing the [[Brokenveil Bluffs]]

Along the western shores, turbulent ocean currents batter trade ships as they ride the winds toward port cities that shine like diamonds on the verdant coastline. Monstrous behemoths plod across the cracked and blighted barrens of the eastern valley. The desolate northern tundra is a lawless wilderness where power-hungry scavengers hunt for ancient artifacts buried beneath the ice. [[Wildemount]] is a vast and varied landscape brimming with possibilities for any adventure.

This chapter presents the various areas of [[Wildemount]], broken into seven major regions: the [[Menagerie Coast]]; the [[Zemni Fields]] and [[Marrow Valley]], which together form [[Western Wynandir]]; the [[Greying Wildlands]] and [[Eiselcross]], which shape what is known as the [[Biting North]]; and lastly the Wastes of [[Xhorhas]] and [[Blightshore]], which comprise [[Eastern Wynandir]]. Each section describes the region's important locations and includes plot hooks for adventurers who travel there.

Adventure hooks presented within this chapter are broken down into recommended ranges of adventuring party level:

-   low level (1–6)
-   mid level (7–11)
-   high level (12–16)
-   epic level (17–20)

Adventure hooks labeled as "any level" can be presented at any point in your party's journey, with a little planning. You are welcome to adjust the difficulty of any of these adventure hooks to fit your campaign.
