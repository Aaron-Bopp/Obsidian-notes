Along the frost-dappled fields of the northern plains, the heart of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] is formed by a sprawl of dirt-packed roads, dense forests, and austere townships that fight back the dangerous creatures of the wilderness. Divided from the southern [[Marrow Valley]] by the mountains of the [[Silberquel Ridge]], this region is known for its gray skies, fits of cold rain, and occasional snowfall, keeping the feet of the denizens muddy and their crops healthy. The [[Dunrock Mountains]] shield the people from the threats that loom beyond the boundaries of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]'s rule, with the [[Rockguard Garrison]] to the east holding firm against the deadly armies of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the dangers that brew beyond the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]]. Home to the mighty imperial capital of [[Rexxentrum]], these fields are the seat of power and commerce for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Diplomats often find themselves traveling to and from the Zemni Fields, while traders and merchants from around the world traverse the long roads in hopes of making their fortunes in the capital city. Even so, the growing ferocity from beasts and creatures that share this region mingle with the whispers of a recovering criminal element and the escalating war with the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] to create a perpetual air of tension and anxiety.

Map 3.4: Zemni Fields


### Amber Crossroads

The Amber Road and the Havenpath Road merge with the Cloakjaunt Path and the Glory Run road to form a great crossroads, where a small makeshift marketplace has sprung up. Mercenaries flock here to find work among traveling caravans, and merchants exchange goods in the absence of imperial oversight before heading into the nearby cities to set up shop. Wandering performers bring color and life to the crossroads, while charlatans of all walks of life take advantage of the fact that the market has no [[Crownsguard]] presence.

The conjunction of trade and travel creates a location rife with mystery, danger, and the need for adventurers.

_**Rob from the Rich (Low Level).**_ Arriving just in time for a semiannual bazaar known as the Carnival of Coin, the characters begin to notice a strange, trance-like state that temporarily overtakes a number of wealthy merchants, who then sell off their most expensive wares for next to nothing. These merchants hire the characters to find the source of this enchantment, which turns out to be a wandering band of charlatans who seek to redistribute wealth to the poor of the [[Marrow Valley]]. The characters must decide whether they wish to turn in these thieves for rewards from the merchants, or let them go and risk becoming hunted alongside them.

_**War Plans (Mid Level).**_ The characters are hired by [[the Myriad]] or the [[Kryn Dynasty]] to intercept imperial documents as they travel from [[Rexxentrum]] to [[Zadash]]. The first courier takes the documents as far as the crossroads before handling them off to a second courier. Both couriers are [knights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/knight) of the [[Crownsguard]] mounted on [warhorses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warhorse). The documents are war plans bearing magical wards and the seal of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]].

### Blumenthal

**Population:** 3,850 (71% [[humans]], 12% [[dwarves]], 11% [[elves]], 6% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Starosta]] Judus Olessia is the appointed leader of [[Blumenthal]], but the countless directives from [[Rexxentrum]] often bypass him entirely.

**Defense:** A respectable cadre of [[Crownsguard]] and a small body of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers keep the farmsteads of [[Blumenthal]] safe.

**Commerce:** While food, produce, and basic supplies are available, little else can be found since most trade heads straight to the capital.

**Organizations:** A temple to [[Pelor]] stands vigil over the heart of the farmland. The farming guilds all work under the strict expectations of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]].

A sprawling collection of rural farmsteads connected by administration buildings, [[Blumenthal]] is [[Rexxentrum]]'s main source of produce and meat. Numerous government-owned fields and orchards harvest cold-weather crops and livestock, and families chosen to tend to the land are paid by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] to gather their goods and deliver them to the gates of the capital. Some who till the land are frustrated that they don't own their plots outright, but with generational incentives for those who keep to the family plot like their ancestors, others see it as investment toward eventually living in greater comfort than the typical farmer.

As [[Rexxentrum]]'s survival depends on [[Blumenthal]]'s fields, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] has erected dozens of [[Crownsguard]] watchtowers at the corner farmers' plots to watch for thieves, scavengers, and monstrous predators. The people of [[Blumenthal]] can't help but feel the watchful eye of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] on them at all times, looming over their work and dampening their spirits. Yet even in such troubled times, [[Starosta]] Judus Olessia works directly with Argonomist [[June Wiston]] to improve the lives of the hard-working farmers who support the success of [[Blumenthal]] — and thus of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Since [[Blumenthal]]'s fields are critical to the survival of the people of [[Rexxentrum]], adventurers might be hired by the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to investigate disappearing or dying animals or crops, or to stop monster raids from the [[Silberquel Ridge]]. Adventurers who work for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] could be asked to destroy crops or poison goods headed for [[Rexxentrum]].

_**Bad Beef (Low Level).**_ Tainted beef from three different cattle farms in [[Blumenthal]] has killed several people in [[Rexxentrum]]. [[Crownsguard]] investigators concluded that the meat was intentionally poisoned and hire the characters to find the culprits. Why hire outsiders? The [[Crownsguard]] in [[Blumenthal]] is on the list of suspects, since they escorted the meat to [[Rexxentrum]]. Of course, the list of suspects doesn't stop there. Did the farmers work together because they abhor living under imperial rule? Is there an agent of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] within [[Blumenthal]]? Is someone using enchantment magic from afar to make farmhands poison beef? One thing is for sure: the culprits are willing to kill and won't come quietly.

### Bysaes Tyl

**Population:** 19,090 (83% [[elves]], 7% [[humans]], 10% other [[races]])

**Government:** The Ring of Three reluctantly cooperates with the appointed [[starosta]], Uther Prent, to govern the city. Exalted elven houses also work with the Ring of Three to preserve their culture under imperial rule.

**Defense:** Both local and assigned [[Crownsguard]] stand ready to defend the city.

**Commerce:** Nearly any equipment, goods, or services are available, though rarer supplies are generally kept from non-elven travelers.

**Organizations:** While smaller temples dedicated to the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods are present, shrines to [[Corellon]], [[Melora]], and [[Sehanine]] hide in plain sight. The beginnings of [[The Myriad|Myriad]] influence are taking hold.

The rustic elven city of [[Bysaes Tyl]] is tucked away in the northern region of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]]. Built synergistically within the tangled boreal forests, this hidden settlement of tall wooden arches and warm hearths sits below a massive network of treehouses and bridges that form the canopy and upper levels of the city. The streets are made of smooth stones set in packed earth, gently enchanted to warm the pathways and melt the frequent snow. Large, bowed tutoring halls hold lectures for the masses, while cleared patches of forest facilitate the training of warriors in the defense of both the city and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

[[Bysaes Tyl]] was founded by [[elves]] who fled the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]] in the [[Savalirwood]] and quietly began to build a new home away from the eyes of the expanding [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The [[elves]] of [[Bysaes Tyl]] struggled through the harsh winters for many years as they constructed their homestead, leaving the past behind to look to the future of their society. Adversity bred a hard, guarded, and tight-knit people.

When [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] discovered that an independent city-state had formed within imperial territory, an imperial envoy was dispatched to present the [[elves]] with an ultimatum: accept [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] rule or prepare for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to claim sovereignty over [[Bysaes Tyl]] by force. The Ring of Three, the elven elders, convened and agreed not to fight. Many of their kind would die in a senseless war — and perhaps the [[elves]] would outlive their imperial rulers many years hence. They agreed to submit and follow imperial laws and pay imperial taxes, under the condition that they could maintain some level of cultural autonomy within their city.

The [[elves]] guard the secrets of their culture as best they can, maintaining a tenuous relationship with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] that holds to this day.

[[Bysaes Tyl]] remains the only city of elven creation within the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The denizens feel an intense need to protect and maintain their cultural legacy, and to search for clues surrounding the mysterious destruction of their ancestral home. As per the agreement between [[Bysaes Tyl]] and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], the Ring of Three has incorporated some elements of imperial society into their own and shared a number of arcane secrets and recovered artifacts from [[Molaesmyr]] with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] in exchange for their city's cultural autonomy. The [[elves]] wish to preserve their unique art and music, their crafting skills and techniques, and knowledge gleaned from the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] that might decide the future of their people. The rumors that secrets and relics within [[Bysaes Tyl]] still remain hidden from [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] heighten the tension between the [[starosta]] and the Ring of Three, in addition to the slowly increasing imperial oversight.

As part of the agreement that brought the city into the fold of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], the Ring of Three, comprised of the elven nobles Allusus Dawyne, Gwey Yethneiros, and Amra Balleei, still oversee most aspects of city life. They must, however, work very closely with [[Starosta]] Uther Prent and his appointed counselors when governing the infrastructure and enforcement of law and order. Uther's prejudice against [[elves]] is well-known throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and many believe this is why he was chosen for his position. The Ring of Three continues to deftly undermine Uther's leadership while simultaneously stroking his ego, a dance that they have thus far executed with grace but which cannot continue forever.

The [[elves]] of the city rarely engage in criminal activity, but escalating theft and brutality from non-elven imperial citizens living within — or passing through — [[Bysaes Tyl]] is a problem that the [[starosta]] largely ignores. Agents of the scattered [[The Myriad|Myriad]] have offered to help the Ring of Three manipulate the [[starosta]] and his council. The Ring of Three are weighing the benefits of letting an unlawful organization into their midst to help their oppressed people against the long-term consequences of working with such untrustworthy allies.

The city exists partially on the forest floor and partially within and around the trees, giving the settlement an air of rustic nostalgia that tempers its elven mystique. The walled surface streets are known as the Rough, or _Talan_, where structures weave between rocks and wide-trunked trees, giving a slanted octagonal shape to the tall, wooden exterior walls of the city. Nearly all structures here are built from pine and other taiga trees, favoring designs that resemble a bowed arch rising to an apex. Spiraling staircases known as the Shrouds, or _Halya_, twist around and within trees, climbing up to the elevated walkways and buildings amid the forest canopy.

[[Bysaes Tyl]]

The tension between [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[elves]] in [[Bysaes Tyl]] plays a part in any of the city's adventures. [[Elves]] trying to maintain their cultural connection with nature and their lost homeland of [[Molaesmyr]] could look to adventurers for aid, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] could use help keeping the peace, and [[the Myriad]] could hire the characters to infiltrate the city.

_**Elves, Arise (Mid Level).**_ A group of [[Elves|elf]] [assassins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin) unhappy with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]'s leadership hatch a plot to simultaneously assassinate the Ring of Three, [[Starosta]] Uther Prent, and other important figures in [[Bysaes Tyl]]. They believe that with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] distracted by the war, now is a perfect time to rise up and take back their city. The characters get wind of the plot and must decide whether to ignore, stop, or support the assassins.

_**Evil, Arise (Epic Level).**_ A powerful artifact of the long-deceased Archmage Oleyahs has been recovered from the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] and is secretly in transit to [[Bysaes Tyl]]. Researchers hope that this object holds a key to understanding the destruction of their ancestral home, but when the object arrives, it is revealed to instead be a deceptive casing for the archmage's [demilich](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/demilich) form. A plague of arcane terror rains on [[Bysaes Tyl]], and the characters are tasked by the Ring of Three to destroy or banish the demilich Oleyahs from the burning city.

### Druvenlode

**Population:** 12,110 (70% [[humans]], 14% [[dwarves]], 9% [[elves]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government:** The city is run by [[Starosta]] Uvilia Whek, who oversees the mining guilds. Her rule is supported by Watchmaster Quin Theramast and her [[Crownsguard]].

**Defense:** A regiment of [[Crownsguard]] help protect the city, as well as the mines. Guildmasters and nobles also maintain personal guards.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies, inns, and taverns are easy to find here. Ore and ingots are readily available, and rough, rare metals are traded on occasion.

**Organizations:** Several temples can be found across the city. While smaller organizations exist within the city, the mining guilds are by far the most powerful and wealthy merchant groups.

Established in the early years following [[the Calamity]], [[Druvenlode]] is the primary source of precious metal in [[Western Wynandir]]. Located at the western base of the [[Silberquel Ridge]] by the mouth of the largest silver vein ever found on the continent. Dusty from wind-swept mountain dirt that turns to mud in the wetter seasons, [[Druvenlode]] is a far cry from beautiful [[Rexxentrum]] or any of the pastoral villages of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Though the city is wealthy, buildings here were designed for function and storage while the talented architects focused on the noble homesteads and wards of the capital, leaving [[Druvenlode]] seemingly rough and rustic by comparison.

[[Starosta]] Uvilia Whek oversees all major mining operations, and the larger mining guilds report directly to her. Maintenance of these mines also requires constantly protecting the workers and battling the dangerous creatures of the [[Silberquel Ridge]], creating a thriving market for mercenary work when the [[Crownsguard]] are too busy — or too cowardly. The majority of the population works directly in or adjacent to the mining industry, laboring within the mines and tunnels, categorizing and smelting recovered minerals and metals, or forging materials into useful tools for distribution across [[Western Wynandir]].

The local [[Crownsguard]] do their best to keep the peace, but with most eyes looking east to the war, the streets are ripe for criminal activity. Theft of goods and ore is increasing, and a call for additional, outside aid grows with it.

[[Druvenlode]] is divided into three main areas. Most citizens live in the ramshackle Dustbellows, where the clustered mass of simple hovels and retrofitted warehouses house those living hand-to-mouth. In these dreary streets, the need for distraction leads to a plethora of experimental music and dance at street corners and simple taverns. Silverstreet is a long thoroughfare where the talented folk of [[Druvenlode]] hawk their wares, advertise their skills, and seek legal ways to earn an income under the watch of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The street is bookended by two massive gambling taverns that vie for dominance: the Sterling Satchel and the Cabin of Fortune. The Pillars is the industrial part of the city, where dark columns of smoke and exhaust belch forth from the massive smelting operations that dot the landscape. Most miners and physical laborers work in this area, and many of them live in the same soot-dusted factories where they toil.

Adventure can be found in [[Druvenlode]]'s mines, which occasionally fill up with burrowing beasts, as well as in the city proper, where shady characters are often found indulging in gambling or petty theft.

_**Fire in the Mines (Mid Level).**_ A being made of fire attacked miners from the Surgoth Guild who were working a vein of silver ore. The miners survived but are too scared to go back into the mine. Instead, they gamble their savings away at the Sterling Satchel. If the characters investigate, they find a path of destruction in the mine that leads to a [fire elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-elemental) under the control of Casper Windmouth (neutral evil, male, [[Humans|human]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)). Casper is a gambler with many debts to pay, so he took a job from an anonymous source to scare the miners out. Was it a rival miner's guild? Was it the proprietors of the Sterling Satchel, looking to hang on to their customers day and night? Or was it the owner of the Cabin of Fortune, hoping to bankrupt their competitor's clients?

### Dunrock Mountains

The snow-dusted peaks of the [[Dunrock Mountains]] encircle the northern end of [[Western Wynandir]], separating the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s territory from the scarred northern region of the [[Greying Wildlands]]. This majestic chain of rocky mountaintops is a snow-dappled bulwark against [[the corruption]] that torments the [[Savalirwood]]. The steep grades and icy terrain make the [[Dunrock Mountains]] perilous to traverse, and few beyond smugglers and gutsy hunters find reason to climb far into these sierras. Dappled with clusters of dense pine trees and cold streams, these beautiful mountains would be picturesque were it not for the roaming giants and wild griffons that hunt among the peaks.

Beneath the surface, the [[Dunrock Mountains]] contain a vast network of tunnels and caverns carved by the [[dwarves]] of [[Grimgolir]] before [[the Calamity]], as well as hidden, collapsible passages utilized by the [[Kryn Dynasty]] to infiltrate the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] during this time of war.

These rocky peaks are home to many creatures and secrets beyond the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s influence.

_**The Crawling Caverns (Mid to High Level).**_ Hidden deep in the heart of the Dunrocks are the forgotten depths of the Bastille of Torment, a massive, multilevel dungeon where [[Torog]] tortured the enemies of the Betrayer Gods during the [[Age of Arcanum]]. This horrifying abandoned prison is now run by a cabal of [spirit nagas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spirit-naga), who guard the many arcane secrets and treasures left by the Betrayers.

### Erdeloch

The [[Erdeloch]] is the largest lake in [[Western Wynandir]], often used as a landmark for travelers making their way toward the capital. Its chilled waters are the most prolific site for freshwater fishing in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and the south side of the [[Erdeloch]] sees quite a number of large and small fishing vessels moving in and out of [[Odessloe]] daily. The many rivers that intersect with the lake make it a nexus of river transport within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], especially for loggers. The north shores, nestled within the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]], are known to be filled with local wildlife and indigenous monsters, so few dare make landfall near the treeline at night.

### Icehaven

**Population:** 5,090 (71% [[humans]], 12% [[elves]], 10% [[dwarves]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government:** Though technically run by Ernath Noack, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]-appointed [[starosta]], the town is mostly ruled by a committee of locals who pay little mind to the will of the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

**Defense:** A small company of [[Crownsguard]] keeps the peace, while a fresh group of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers have been assigned to the docks.

**Commerce:** Resources are limited, so mostly basic supplies and standard arms are available. Relics recovered from [[Eiselcross]] can occasionally pass through, providing strange and exotic curiosities for acquisition.

**Organizations:** Simple temples mark city squares, while hidden shrines to Crown-forbidden gods lurk on the outskirts of the town. The [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] continues to push for stronger influence, and [[The Myriad|Myriad]] operatives interested in [[Eiselcross]]'s mysteries are also beginning to work their way into [[Icehaven]].

Along the icy northeastern shores of the Zemni Fields stands the only port in [[Western Wynandir]]. [[Icehaven]] is home to the dozen or so ships in the region outfitted to wander the ice floes of the [[Frigid Depths]], and is the central trade post and only open port for hunters and adventurers who brave the [[Saltwallow Bog]] or the frozen north toward [[Eiselcross]]. The inhabitants of [[Icehaven]] earn their living ice fishing within the oft-frozen [[Kaltenloch]], or are trappers who stalk the [[Velvin Thicket]] or edges of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]] and return to peddle their furs and meats. Some more confident individuals might try their hand at netting some [[Eiselcross]] crab, a rare delicacy throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], but the shifting, freezing weather makes such endeavors dangerous.

As the war with the [[Kryn Dynasty]] escalated far to the east, few eyes were on the backwater port of [[Icehaven]] until fishers and explorers began to return from expeditions to [[Eiselcross]] with stories of odd ruins and even odder creatures. Rumors of pre-Calamity artifacts began to spread among the nobles of [[Rexxentrum]], until [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] suddenly took an interest. With an influx of soldiers, [[sellswords]], and fortune-seekers looking to make their way to the mysterious landmass, [[Icehaven]] and its residents are trying to adapt to the unexpected attention.

While [[Icehaven]] is rarely of concern to the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the town has a [[starosta]]. Currently the office is held by Ernath Noack, an older man who survived an extensive forty-year career as an [[Eiselcross]] crab fisherman. The local government is mostly left well enough alone except when it comes time for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]'s tithe collectors to exact taxes. This yearly event has become something of an occasion to the lower-class fisher folk, who harangue the tithe collectors with fusillades of insults and endless pranks, each more humiliating than the last.

Due to the relative lack of imperial oversight and the harsh weather, many of the [[Crownsguard]] assigned to [[Icehaven]] put minimal effort into their watch, leaving room for laws to be bent or broken. The general sense of being at the end of the world during the long winter makes many within the town feel disconnected from the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and its laws, which is both liberating and disconcerting.

Surrounding the small inlet harbor, [[Icehaven]] is a cramped, crescent-shaped town of snow-coated log cabins and lantern-lined street corners. The city is divided into two main areas: the Harborline, where the docks house the fishing vessels and the few ice-ready ships, and the Haven, where the crowded buildings seem to be clustered together for warmth. The streets shift between snowy mud and slicks of ice, curving through twisting alleys in a haphazard layout.

As a remote port town, [[Icehaven]] has need of adventurers to enforce the law, escort caravans, and find supplies in the wilderness.

_**Snowed In (Any Level).**_ While the characters are in [[Icehaven]], a terrible blizzard strikes, leaving many residents to fend for themselves inside their homes. As the snowdrifts rise and wind howls, a gang of criminals or monsters comes in to cause mayhem and take whatever they like. If the characters don't brave the snow to stop these villains, no one will.

### Kaltenloch

The harsh winters in the region cause the [[Kaltenloch]] to remain frozen over for three to four months out of the year, but the cold lake provides fish to the community of [[Icehaven]] year-round. With the ice comes a mysterious low mist that many say is made up of the spirits of fallen Calamity soldiers, looking for warmth to steal.

### Nogvurot

**Population:** 15,270 (70% [[humans]], 17% [[dwarves]], 8% [[elves]], 5% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Starosta]] Brumae Luddie handles the affairs of the city with the support of the lawmaster's regiment of [[Crownsguard]]. Nobles under the [[starosta]] handle in local administration.

**Defense:** A number of [[Crownsguard]] share protective duties with a regiment of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers called the Last Aegis.

**Commerce:** Well-stocked trading posts and inns make most supplies readily available, though rare or exotic goods are difficult to locate.

**Organizations:** There are temples to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods, and most businesses are independently run without the oversight of a guild.

A major stop along the Glory Run Road heading eastward from the capital, [[Nogvurot]] hosts travelers making their way through the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], many of whom need provisions and like to buy locally made trinkets as souvenirs of their journey. There is some business to be had in a small mine at the base of the [[Dunrock Mountains]] to the north of the city, but most [[Nogvurot]] folk earn their keep by crafting, farming, or joining the local military.

Originally founded as a guard post near the Quannah Breach to watch for deadly creatures wandering from the [[Savalirwood]], this settlement has since grown to be a fair-sized military reserve for the [[Righteous Brand]]. The regiment of the [[Righteous Brand]] stationed within the city would be the defending army against any assault headed for the capital, granting them the title of the last Aegis. Nearly half of the city's population is military reserve, with just over six thousand troops present at any given time. The bored or restless soldiers, seeking distraction and entertainment, developed the barracks of the Aegis Block into a place of sport and competitive game, often with impressive amounts of coin wagered on the outcomes. However, between reports of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] taking the [[Ashguard Garrison]] and rumors of unexplained [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] attacks within the [[Marrow Valley]] itself, the Aegis is very much on edge.

[[Starosta]] Brumae Luddie, a retired general of the [[Righteous Brand]], has watched over the city for fifteen years. Brumae is driven by a strong sense of duty and pride in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], never questioning the words of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. Because Brumae is regarded by most as a fair and just [[starosta]], some fear that his advanced age will soon bring an end to his tenure and allow less-scrupulous figures to vie for his position.

The strong military presence within [[Nogvurot]] keeps petty crime within the city to a minimum. Unfortunately, the [[Crownsguard]] often puff out their chests and try to one-up the soldiers of the [[Righteous Brand]] — and some local criminals have taken advantage of this petty rivalry to keep the soldiers distracted and continue their criminal behavior unimpeded.

Corruption is also becoming a problem, as Last Aegis soldiers use their sway within the city to make easy coin by turning a blind eye to smuggling to and from [[Shadycreek Run]] and other criminal hotspots in the [[Greying Wildlands]].

The oblong city is divided between the eastern Aegis Block, which houses the bulk of the stationed soldiers, and the western region of the city that is broken into two sectors: the northern Scatters and the southern Peddler's Row. The Scatters is the larger region, housing dive taverns, simple temples, and a majority of the populace, who live in numerous neighborhoods of rickety domiciles. In contrast, Peddler's Row is a bustling home to local craft guilds and a colorful, if muddy, marketplace where the Glory Run Road passes through the city.

Characters could go to [[Nogvurot]] to find someone in the city or to join the [[Righteous Brand]]. The city is also a good place for adventurers looking to test their mettle in competitive games against trained soldiers.

_**Traitors in the Midst (Low Level).**_ The characters are approached by Telva Cornwrath (neutral, female, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)), who claims to work for the [[Augen Trust]]. She hires the characters to infiltrate the ranks of the [[Righteous Brand]] in [[Nogvurot]] and discover which soldiers are accepting bribes from the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]]. She wants to know which criminal family pays each crooked official. She could be who she claims, or she might be a spy for [[the Myriad]] or one of the Tribes in [[Shadycreek Run]] looking to remove competition. In the latter case, she might not want the characters sticking around as loose ends.

### Odessloe

**Population:** 6,970 (73% [[humans]], 12% [[elves]], 8% [[dwarves]], 7% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Starosta]] Vesdan Wothassic is eager to please [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and demands huge harvests from the fishers of [[Odessloe]]. As resentment builds, the few noble families who have business interests here work with Watchmaster Lein Untgaf to maintain order.

**Defense:** A small cadre of [[Crownsguard]] watch over the city under the direction of the watchmaster.

**Commerce:** As a popular trade stop on the way to the capital, [[Odessloe]] has many taverns and hostels. General stores provide basic supplies and occasionally offer strange relics pawned by cash-strapped adventurers.

**Organizations:** The city harbors many small shrines to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods. Most businesses are run by locals but owned by absentee nobles. [[The Myriad]] has a quiet presence here.

Adjacent to the clear waters of the [[Erdeloch]], [[Odessloe]] is a prominent fishing and logging settlement, supplying [[Rexxentrum]] and the surrounding townships with fresh fish and lumber. The only major stop on the Cloakjaunt Path for those traveling between [[Bysaes Tyl]] and the capital, [[Odessloe]] also acts as a supply stop for traders and drifters moving through the shaded trees of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]].

The bounty provided by the [[Erdeloch]] is a source of local pride as well as the backbone of the local economy. The people of [[Odessloe]] are a superstitious lot, and many believe that the lake is home to a spirit that must be kept happy if they are to continue to receive its bountiful blessings. They leave offerings at the shores of the lake to appease this unseen entity. Imperial officials, including the [[starosta]], find this practice childish and actively dissuade citizens from indulging in "unlawful idol worship."

[[Starosta]] Vesdan Wothassic has held his position for a year, since the passing of the beloved [[Starosta]] Ruell. Vesdan has big shoes to fill and is eager to prove his worth to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. He has demanded resource yields from his citizens and enforced penalties on those who fail to meet his standards. Unsurprisingly, the people are already voicing their dissatisfaction with the new [[starosta]]. The nobles who profit from the local businesses grow worried that their investments are in danger — and are working with the watchmaster to try and suppress any talk of outright insurrection.

The city sees its small share of petty thefts and solitary criminal activity, but lacks the size and infrastructure to house an organized criminal element. This works to the advantage of [[the Myriad]], which has been using the rivers that connect to the [[Erdeloch]] as smuggling routes, with [[Odessloe]] acting as a hub for transactions and storage, all without the government's knowledge.

Built along the eastern shore of the [[Erdeloch]], this kidney-shaped city is comprised of three major areas. The muddy Lakeside region on the western end houses the docks, river-based storage buildings, and scattered housing for denizens of the district. Verdant and clean, the Greenset region on the eastern side of the settlement holds numerous logging camps and most of the residential homesteads for working families. The Crossmark region is the smaller center of the city, where the other regions meet at the juncture of the two largest thoroughfares, Cedarline Street and Hogmarshal Road. The smell of starchy foods and fresh fish suffuses the inns and market stalls of this sleepy intersection.

With [[the Myriad]] lurking in [[Odessloe]], there are plenty of opportunities for characters who want to work for or against the organization. The settlement also makes an excellent base of operations for adventurers exploring the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]].

_**Feeling Crabby (Low Level).**_ The residents of [[Odessloe]] fear that they somehow angered the spirit of the [[Erdeloch]]. Starving giant crabs from the lake have terrorized the Greenset region of the settlement every night for the past week. The cityfolk have left expensive offerings for the spirit on the lake's banks. These offerings are taken, but the crabs continue to attack. If the characters investigate, they find a group of bandits who are capturing and starving the crabs before releasing them into the settlement, and stealing the offerings for themselves. Are these ruffians connected to [[the Myriad]]? Could the stolen offerings anger the actual spirit of the lake enough to punish the settlement for the disrespect?

### Pride's Call

**Population:** 16,090 (81% [[dwarves]], 8% [[humans]], 6% [[halflings]], 5% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Starosta]] Ghuldi Demosk walks the fine line of honoring imperial rule without undermining dwarven tradition. Small guilds run by [[Dwarves|dwarf]] nobles support his rule.

**Defense:** Watchmaster Hildas Cliffhollow oversees the local [[Crownsguard]], which is sometimes bolstered by mercenaries.

**Commerce:** Most goods and services are available here, including room and board for travelers. Pride silk is a popular commodity.

**Organizations:** [[Dwendalian Empire|Empire]]-approved gods have humble temples alongside the local guilds and businesses, while [[The Myriad|Myriad]] agents lurk within the shadows of the city.

Within the rolling hills of the southern Zemni Fields lies the dwarven city of Pride's Call. Established in the ashes of [[the Calamity]] and slowly rebuilt as the center of hill [[Dwarves|dwarf]] culture in [[Wildemount]], Pride's Call chose to ally with the [[Dwendalian Empire]] during the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s expansion nearly two centuries ago. Their favor as the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s first allies eventually waned when the dwarven city of [[Grimgolir]] was absorbed a century later, leaving Pride's Call overshadowed by the new, impressive, and strategically significant [[Dwarves|dwarf]] city. However, Pride's Call is nonetheless respectable in martial might and historically rich in culture, music, and their coveted pride silk. The city is a bright spot in the otherwise cold and dour northwestern Wynandir.

During the invasion of the [[Julous Dominion]], the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] saw many great deeds done under the banner of Pride's Call. After helping the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] achieve victory, the people of Pride's Call enjoyed a period of celebratory attention. Their fame subsided, however, as [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] attention turned to the mounting threat of [[Xhorhas|Xhorhasian]] terrors boldly crossing the Brokenveil. Talks had already been privately underway to bring the dwarven stronghold of [[Grimgolir]] under imperial rule, given their military might and advantageous proximity to the brewing danger. With the combination of [[Grimgolir]]'s power and the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s plentiful resources, victory was ensured and a strong sentinel force at the [[Xhorhas|Xhorhasian]] border was established. [[Grimgolir]] became the new favored home of the [[dwarves]] in Wynandir, and many Pride's Call [[dwarves]] who lived through those years still hold a grudge — a fact that [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] deftly wields to exploit both cities.

The [[dwarves]] of Pride's Call produce a number of useful exports, but none are as unique nor as sought after as pride silk. This remarkable fabric can only be woven from materials found in the unique ecosystem of the geothermically active hills around Pride's Call. A special breed of silkworms has developed in these strange conditions. These fist-sized silkworms produce abnormally thin and incredibly resilient strands, and a secret process of reinforcing the threads creates a material similar in texture and appearance to thick silk, but with the strength of treated leather. Affluent folk across [[Exandria]] pay handsomely for garments made of pride silk, but rumors are beginning to spread that outsiders have uncovered the secret, and the tradition might be slipping from the grasp of Pride's Call.

Pride's Call is governed by the [[Dwarves|dwarf]] who signed the original pact with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. [[Starosta]] Ghuldi Demosk spends his twilight years doing what he can to maintain his culture in the face of an increasingly invasive rule. Idealistic and unable to see any error in his judgment, Ghuldi is seen by many as hardheaded among even the most stubborn of [[dwarves]]. Many of his people are loudly voicing their discontent, and younger politicians such as Usula Starsburn are rising in popularity to succeed as [[starosta]] when Ghuldi eventually passes away. Fearing that he will have to choose between his legacy and the opinions of younger generations, Ghuldi is beginning to exhibit more totalitarian behaviors, slowly becoming a petulant dictator.

While the city's colorful veneer makes it seem a place of plenty, the economy of Pride's Call has been in slow decline for some time. The landscape's strange mineral composition makes its produce a healthy but unsavory and unpopular export, while other goods that previously brought the city prosperity are now more readily and quickly available from traders on the [[Menagerie Coast]]. This economic downturn has led to a rise in crime in the impoverished regions of the city, and also opened the door for bolder [[The Myriad|Myriad]] activity.

The city is comprised of four boroughs built atop and within a cluster of large hills that wrap around the base of the Cyrios Mountains. The two largest boroughs, known as the Tillers and Crafters, are twin sections of mixed residential neighborhoods with areas of concentrated commerce. The Tillers cultivates produce and meats for the city, though most local food has a bland and bitter taste, making spices a popular import. The Crafters contains numerous forges, tanneries, and the well-guarded subterranean silk-production warehouses. Nearest to the mountains is the Vigil borough, where the locally trained [[Crownsguard]] mingle with those assigned from [[Bladegarden]] to watch over the hillside. The western branch of the [[Righteous Brand]] are also stationed in the Vigil borough. Between Vigil and Crafters lies the fourth and smallest borough, called Moot, which is marked by a circular road surrounded by the wealthier houses. The Moot itself is an open, stone forum for discussion and debate that long predates the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s rule.

Hills of Pride’s Call

If the characters seek pride silk or master artisans, Pride's Call is where they should go. In a city experiencing political and economic turmoil, there is no end to the intriguing adventures characters might experience.

_**Worm Your Way In (Low Level).**_ The characters encounter a traveling textile merchant named Cardorn Brentahill (neutral evil, male, [[Humans|human]] [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/noble)), who lives in [[Yrrosa]]. He's seeking bodyguards to help him escort his cart back to his home, paying 100 gp per hired hand. Along the journey, the characters and their employer are attacked by a crew of mercenaries representing the Durrodan family, claiming that Cardorn stole silk worms from their silk farm. Cardorn offers to increase the characters' pay if they defend him. If they side with the Durrodan family, Cardorn is taken prisoner but the Durrodans grant them a small reward and the promise of future work. If they side with Cardorn, fight off the mercenaries, and escort Cardorn home, he introduces the characters to Gothad Miskal (neutral evil, male, [[Halflings|halfling]] [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)), a [[The Myriad|Myriad]] taskmaster from [[Yrrosa]] who is interested in offering better pay for less legal work.

### Rastum Den

Hidden among the [[Dunrock Mountains]], north of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]] and [[Rexxentrum]], is an encampment for breeding and training military griffons. These mighty beasts are used by the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] griffon riders of the [[Righteous Brand]], some of the best-respected soldiers in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Known as [[Rastum Den]], this moderately sized encampment is nestled in a small valley four thousand feet up in the mountains. The area's dizzying heights and tumultuous weather make it all but inaccessible to those without a griffon rider's prowess. This location was originally home to the largest griffon population in [[Wildemount]], making it natural terrain to quickly condition any young mounts bred for the [[Righteous Brand]].

### Rexxentrum

**Population:** 205,200 (81% [[humans]], 8% [[dwarves]], 6% [[halflings]], 5% other [[races]])

**Government:** King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] rules the city and the [[Dwendalian Empire]] from [[Rexxentrum]]. He delegates lesser matters to Arbiter [[Sydnock Truscan]], while citywide guild business falls under the purview of Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]].

**Defense:** [[Crownsguard]] patrol all major streets, while the bulk of the [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] are stationed in [[Bertrand Dwendal|the King]]'s Bastion to defend the capital city.

**Commerce:** [[Rexxentrum]] is the largest city in [[Wildemount]] and the seat of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s power, enabling massive volumes of trade in and out of the city. Most any goods, services, and places of business can be found within the city walls.

**Organizations:** Grand temples to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods can be found throughout the city, while the most powerful guilds in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] vie for power and influence. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] takes an active role in political affairs, while the deep-rooted [[The Myriad|Myriad]] weaves tapestries of crime and corruption throughout the city.

The majestic capital of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] was founded in the year 514 PD. The central location and plentiful surrounding resources of the region made [[Rexxentrum]] the most favorable place to oversee the rule and expansion of the freshly established [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Over the next three centuries, [[Rexxentrum]] grew to become the largest city in [[Wildemount]], and the cultural and military center of [[Western Wynandir]].

At the core of all imperial politics are the nobles, politicians, and wealthy elite who live within the city or own property there. Grandiose displays of wealth and power are common among the inner wards, while sprawling poverty consumes the outer districts and slums beyond the protective walls of the city. Cobblestone streets twist and mingle through the bustling neighborhoods, cart merchants and street performers vying for the attention and patronage of passersby throughout the cold summer months and the even colder winter.

Glowing orbs of arcane fire flicker at the tops of dark iron lamp poles at major intersections, lighting the evening air, while colorful flowers adorn the inner archways of each neighborhood entryway. Buildings cluster close and reach toward the sky, often snow-dappled with long wooden slats placed between rooftops for riffraff to skitter across the city unseen. Although the city teems with life and activity, it is also full of lawkeepers and military watch, with griffon riders occasionally circling overhead above the ever-patrolling [[Crownsguard]] and the nearby [[Righteous Brand]] headquarters.

The massive and beautiful center for arcane study known as the [[Soltryce Academy]] is located in [[the Candles]], a thin crescent of a neighborhood marked by the tall and imposing tower homes of all eight leading members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], each unique and imposing in its own way. The beating heart of the city, and of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], lies positioned within the arc of [[the Candles]] in the terrace of [[Castle Ungebroch]]. From within the castle halls, King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] and his council of chosen authorities oversee all matters of state.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/3.5-[[Rexxentrum]].jpg)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/3.5-[[Rexxentrum]].jpg)

Map 3.5: [[Rexxentrum]] [View Player Version](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/3.5-[[Rexxentrum]]-player.jpg)

Much of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s prosperity over the centuries stems from the [[Cerberus Assembly]], a union of the nation's most powerful mages working directly for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. These arcane practitioners and scholars aid [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] in engaging foreign interests, in developing magical technology to better oversee the land and enforce his will, and making use of the rare relics that [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] confiscates from unearthed sites of pre-Calamity might. This arrangement affords the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] homes in [[the Candles]] and across the major cities of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], as well as access to every [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] political figure. Thus, members of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] are extremely influential and, by the nature of their arrangement, very carefully watched by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. Most civilians swap rumors of demonic pacts and demigod-level magics at the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]'s disposal, adding to their aura of mystique among the common folk. When an [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] mage walks the streets of [[Rexxentrum]] or attends the halls of an establishment within the city, it is an event that everyone will be talking about for days to come.

The resource-rich economy of [[Rexxentrum]] supports a powerful guild and merchant class, who work directly with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] under the watch of Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]]. Any permanent place of business is required to join a corresponding guild, paying an annual fee on top of their taxes to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], and to follow the guild's requirements for conditions of operations. Some complain that these conditions are often manipulated on a case-by-case basis to remove competition between similar interests, but cries of corruption within the guilds fall on deaf ears. This has led to a rapid growth of mobile businesses on street corners and shops that move between districts to avoid inspection by [[Crownsguard]] or guild members.

#### Politics and Persecution

Historically, public displays of unease under [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]'s rule were often met with brutal punishment. However, the previous king, [[Everard Dwendal]], loosened the laws applying to public discourse. This gave rise to a number of political figures who gathered the unhappy populace behind their philosophies. In response, King Everard established the [[Augen Trust]], a network of spies working for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] to blackmail or corrupt these politicians. With these high-profile dissenters under the thumb of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], controlling political discourse became easier, and politics within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] became a tense game of cat and mouse. Forthright nobles and frustrated guild heads unswayed by propaganda, gold, or threats still dissent publicly, testing the boundaries of their influence. King Bertrand's patience with public objections to his policies grows ever thinner, and he is enacting even more stringent laws against public criticism of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]].

In the wake of frustrated citizens, neglected concerns, and a clear caste system, the common folk of [[Rexxentrum]] are disenfranchised. The rallying call of war has brought some renewed imperial pride, but whispers of discontent have continued, coalescing into a small group of rebels within the capital that call themselves the Locksmiths. Wary of the history of failed rebellions in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], they gather information and gradually inspire the common folk to question authority, waiting for the right moment to ignite a revolution with a chance of success. With [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] distracted by war and the populace brimming with poverty and discontentment, that time might come sooner than anyone thinks.

King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] rules the capital himself. No [[starosta]] holds office within [[Rexxentrum]]. [[Prime Arbiter]] [[Sydnock Truscan]] oversees all major matters of law that do not require the attention of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], while Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]] works with the various guilds of the city to ensure smooth trade both within and beyond the walls of [[Rexxentrum]]. Beneath Sydnock is the head of [[Rexxentrum]]'s [[Crownsguard]], Watchmaster Brunda Gleshin, who ensures that the laws of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] are enforced in the streets of the capital.

The capital city harbors a diverse criminal underground both within and beneath the streets. Surviving [[The Myriad|Myriad]] leaders remain hidden in plain sight throughout the city, including the beloved [[Iris Bethelas]], who is organizing the syndicate's return to power. Independent crime rings plague trade centers and busy districts where there are easy gold and gullible cityfolk. The populace is simply too large for the [[Crownsguard]] to oversee every corner of cobblestone where laws are bent or broken. Now, with the collective attention of the law focused on the war in the east, thieves and cutpurses are upping their game, and crime is on the rise within [[Rexxentrum]].

The city spreads across the tallgrass fields south of the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]], its walls forming a distended pentagon. Farmland around the north and east sides of the city are dotted with farmsteads and small rural communities that provide food for the capital. The northeast side of the wall curves around a trio of immense, fortified towers surrounded by barracks known as [[Bertrand Dwendal|the King]]'s Bastion, where the central force of the [[Righteous Brand]] military trains and resides. Within the outer walls of the city are seven major districts: the Mosaic Ward, the [[Mudtop Ward]], [[the Tangles]], the [[Shimmer Ward]], the Academy Grounds, [[the Candles]], and [[Castle Ungebroch Terrace]].

_**Mosaic Ward**_. A sprawl of impoverished neighborhoods are hidden behind colorful banners and small fences that segregate this ratty residential district from the central thoroughfares and avenues. The region, which encompasses most of the southern and southwestern regions of the city along the outer walls, is a hotbed for crime and violence. [[Crownsguard]] interest in policing the region wavers, and opportunists often use the lack of military presence to victimize poorer citizens. This has led to a growing collection of vigilantes and self-appointed protectors of the Mosaics.

_**Mudtop Ward.**_ The northern end of the city houses its own large slum, known as the [[Mudtop Ward]]. The cobblestone streets of the city were never quite built up to the northern wall, causing this area to be rife with mud and muck year round, leaving the denizens cold, ornery, and prone to illness. Many of the sick and diseased are relegated to the Mudtop to be forgotten. However, some healers have come to their aid, as well as some priests who wish to remedy the unjust conditions of the poor, becoming local heroes for their selfless work.

_**The Tangles.**_ This western region of [[Rexxentrum]] houses the working class folk of the city. It is here that most of the city's general commerce takes place. Dozens of smaller streets branch off major roads to create a labyrinth of twisting neighborhoods and industrial districts. The network of major roads converges to form three major plazas across the district, where shops, inns, and various forms of entertainment can be found. The Platinum Veranda plaza lies at the northern end of [[the Tangles]], where the more expensive homes and luxurious entertainment can be found, as well as the central temple to [[Bahamut]], called the [[Dragon]] Seat.

Near the southern end of [[the Tangles]] is the [[Vigil's Circle]], a marketplace built around a loop of road that surrounds the Tower of Writ, the temple to [[Erathis]] where the [[Prime Arbiter]] delivers his judgment. All manner of commerce takes place here, while the nearby [[Claykeep prison]] looms as an ominous reminder to any who might seek to break the laws of the land.

The Court of Colors, on the western edge of [[the Tangles]], is the largest of the three main plazas. The Court is a winding knot of streets, each of which is wholly dedicated to traders who come from far-off places to sell their exotic wares, while artists and performers bring an air of lively celebration despite the gray and dreary skies of the region. It's within this lively area that the [[Rexxentrum]] Archive of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] can be found. Near the southern wall of the [[Shimmer Ward]] is the [[Chantry of the Dawn]], the ancient temple to the [[Pelor|Dawn Father]] on which the city was originally founded, now restored and expanded into an awe-inspiring cathedral.

_**Shimmer Ward.**_ Within the inner walls of the city, the [[Shimmer Ward]] is where the noble houses and guild leaders of [[Rexxentrum]] dwell. Here, beautiful gardens and museums celebrate [[Dwendalian Empire|Zemnian]] culture, and specialist merchants promote their unique wares. The debate forum is rarely used aside from holidays, where intellectuals will challenge each other to arguments about philosophy and history. Cottages and tasteful estates sit behind tall fences and walls, and a pair of open squares host occasional galas when the local elite are in need of socialization.

_**Academy Grounds.**_ To the northwest of the castle lie the Academy Grounds, a well-kept and heavily guarded campus where the halls and towers of the [[Soltryce Academy]] reside. A college of higher learning for all pursuits related to the arcane arts, the [[Soltryce Academy]] is all but exclusively a school for wealthy scions, though a number of rare talents found in the wild are offered entry every year. Each subject's curriculum is tailored so that the young mind is indoctrinated to support the interests of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] is always looking for prodigies with exemplary talent to take under its wing.

_**The Candles.**_ East of the castle stands the collection of eight tall spires that house the members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Each tower has its own unique appearance. The original Candles were built to the specifications of the original leading members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. In the years since, each tower has been magically altered to the taste of their successors. This creates a jagged and subtly unsettling sight visible from any point in the city.

_**Castle Ungebroch Terrace.**_ Standing vigilant in the center of the inner walls is the [[Castle Ungebroch Terrace]], a small district of compact military outposts that surround [[Castle Ungebroch]]. The dark stone of the castle splits into numerous towers, while high-arched stained glass windows dress the exterior of each floor of the citadel. Within the shadowy halls of the castle, lit by flickering torchlight, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] rules with his family and councilors at his beck and call.

A noble house in [[Rexxentrum]] that isn't scheming for more power is a noble house in decline, or so the gentry believe. The city's officials and nobles have schemes to grab more money and power, and more than a few of the common folk have their own plots to launch themselves into positions of influence. Most of these social climbers need the help of adventurers willing to take risks, while others often need protection from their fellow schemers.

_**Call a Locksmith (Low Level).**_ The exploits of the characters might draw the attention of the Locksmiths, a resistance group seeking to undermine the totalitarian rule of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. A friendly face the characters have come to know within the city invites them to meet Lady Quana Seledo (chaotic good, female, [[Humans|human]] [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/noble)), a well-connected figure who reveals herself to be a key figure in the Locksmiths. She asks the characters to join the cause, offering allies, rare goods, and well-paid work. If they agree, the first mission begins: help the Locksmiths infiltrate the office of Exchequer [[Aethia Drooze]] and steal the current year's tithe ledgers.

_**King Killers (Mid Level).**_ The characters intercept a cryptic note which indicates that there will be an attempt on King [[Bertrand Dwendal]]'s life the next time the monarch makes a public appearance. The characters are too inexperienced to get an audience with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] or anyone close to him, so it's up to the characters to thwart the plot. These [assassins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin) could be sent by the [[Kryn Dynasty]], the [[Cerberus Assembly]], [[the Myriad]], the [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] of a [[Betrayer god]], or by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] itself to garner sympathy among the people. If the characters manage to stop the assassins, they earn the notice of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], who will likely ask more of them.

### Rockguard Garrison

**Population:** 6,800 (71% [[humans]], 12% [[halflings]], 12% [[dwarves]], 5% other [[races]])

**Government:** The garrison is commanded by Marshal Garad Velious, who oversees regiment captains that hold sway in the area.

**Defense:** Three regiments of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers defend and patrol the garrison and the surrounding mountains.

**Commerce:** Most supplies within are military rations and stationed equipment. Trade with the local soldiers can yield goods and services.

**Organizations:** Small shrines to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods have been constructed by the soldiers. Aside from the [[Righteous Brand]], [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], and their allies in [[Grimgolir]], no other organizations have authority over the garrison.

The [[Rockguard Garrison]] was constructed in a joint effort between [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and [[Grimgolir]] as a symbol of their political union. The sister-fortress to the [[Ashguard Garrison]] is the foremost defense post against the ever-encroaching forces of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the monstrous hordes of the wastelands to the east. It boasts a formidable army and a near-impenetrable perimeter that expands into a series of defensible weapon posts along the sides of the valley to further dissuade any force from attempting an invasion. This fortress has held strong for generations without being breached, but the loss of the [[Ashguard Garrison]] is still fresh in the minds of the soldiers stationed here. A cold intensity hangs over each passing day as the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] forces plot to reclaim their captured outpost and remain vigilant against a similar assault.

[[Rockguard Garrison]] adventures usually relate directly to the war. Defending the outpost from attacks, planning strikes against the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], and other military missions for [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] are carried out here on a daily basis.

_**Steal the Plans (Low Level).**_ Agents of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] hire the characters to infiltrate the [[Rockguard Garrison]] and uncover [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]'s plans to retake the [[Ashguard Garrison]]. The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] want any physical plans the characters find to remain in place to ensure [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] doesn't realize the plot, so all written documents containing key information need to be copied. The garrison's [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard), [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout), and [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) patrol the place and question characters who obviously sneak around or don't belong.

### Ruins of Shattengrod

This sinkhole is a rocky pit measuring roughly thirty feet across and sixty feet deep. Littered with ancient bones, the pit was long considered just a macabre curiosity, referred to by the [[dwarves]] of Pride's Call as the Grave Hole. When tales of the strange location reached inquiring minds within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], an investigation was launched. Beneath the pit, explorers discovered the sundered ruins of a prominent city from the [[Age of Arcanum]] called Shattengrod. Heavy excavation expanded the pit into a spiraling hole that delves into the subterranean city, unveiling broken relics and forgotten secrets — as well as some enduring shades and hungry entities now awakened. The promise of beneficial discoveries pushes both interests of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] to delve into the ruins, but the deaths of mercenaries are already drawing attention as rumors of the dangers below spread and scare off many possible hires.

### Saltwallow Bog

Born from the sunken muck that merges with the northern treeline of the [[Velvin Thicket]], the [[Saltwallow Bog]] is a marsh of briny, slightly acidic waters. Myths speak of a terrible servant of the Crawling King that was slain during the battles of [[the Calamity]], its corrosive corpse sinking into the floor of the forest and corrupting the thicket around it until this toxic bog was left as a final cry of defiance. Strange and twisted creatures have adapted to live in this grotesque place, delving into the [[Velvin Thicket]] to hunt and drag their prey back to their lairs in the bog. As dangerous as they are, some of these creatures are now highly prized by tanners and alchemists for their leather and harvested parts, and hunters venture into the depths of the bog year-round, risking life and limb for coin.

### Silberquel Ridge

The imposing mountain range known as the [[Silberquel Ridge]] extends across the middle of [[Western Wynandir]], dividing the [[Marrow Valley]] from the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]]. A range of jagged mountain tops visible from most cities in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], the [[Silberquel Ridge]] is an important landmark, but it is best known for its seemingly endless cache of rich metals and deep caverns. The ore and gems mined here provided [[Rexxentrum]] with most of its wealth and funded the rise of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The surface veins are the largest source of silver in [[Wildemount]], but the deeper paths reveal other precious metals, gems, and forgotten remnants of pre-[[Divergence]] curiosities — and many deadly beasts that have come to call those ancient corners home.

Traveling across the [[Silberquel Ridge]] is its own adventure, given the number of dangerous creatures that inhabit the region's mountains and tunnels. Caravans, miners, and prospectors hire adventurers to guard them as they travel and work in the mountains.

_**Hell Hound Purge (Mid Level).**_ Marta Denizreitch (chaotic neutral, female, [[Humans|human]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) lives in a remote tower where she experiments with conjuration magic to develop new spells. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] funds Marta's research. Years ago, Marta had a problem with [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) attacking the tower, so she summoned [hell hounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hell-hound) to roam the wilds near her tower and keep the trolls at bay. She does not want the hell hounds to cause problems down the line, so she hires the characters to hunt a few to keep the population down. The characters discover they aren't the only ones killing hell hounds: a [hill giant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hill-giant) and a small gang of trolls are killing the hounds in preparation for an attack on Marta's tower!

### Velvin Thicket

**Population:** 850 (98% [[gnomes]], 2% other [[races]])

**Government:** The people of the Thicket are governed by a loose union between the leaders of the Velvins, the collection of local nomadic clans who convene only when threatened.

**Defense:** While few are specifically trained for combat, many denizens of the Thicket are well-versed in illusion magic for self-defense.

**Commerce:** Those that have the trust of the Velvins can acquire basic supplies, dyolet fruit, and the occasional unusual relic.

**Organizations:** Scattered altars to the Wild Mother exist throughout the Thicket. Each of the seven nomadic clans handles its own internal affairs. Representatives from Pride's Call often visit for a time to maintain their relationship with the Velvin leaders.

Bordering the soggy fields of the [[Saltwallow Bog]] is the strange forest known as the [[Velvin Thicket]]. The nomadic gnomish clans that call these dense woods home have a loose network of allied families rather than a central township, and they defend their shaded sanctuary with illusions and enchantments. Because of the Velvins' trade agreement with Pride's Call, the dwarven city was able to request that the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] keep the thicket from becoming formally assimilated into [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] society so long as the Velvins provided a small but consistent crop of dyolets. The dyolet fruit is a rare delicacy receptive to minor enchantments and only grows within the [[Velvin Thicket]]. The [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s interest in permitting Velvin autonomy has waned over the years, and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] is keen to take the Thicket under its jurisdiction and seize control of the dyolet crop.

The [[Gnomes|gnome]] families that live in the [[Velvin Thicket]] are suspicious of outsiders. The [[Cerberus Assembly]]'s interest in the area might be enough to bring the characters to this strange place.

_**Dyolet Mounds (Mid Level).**_ Herwin Melvot (chaotic neutral, male, forest [[Gnomes|gnome]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) attempted to grow a new kind of dyolet with magic. His experiment resulted in shambling mounds made of dyolet plants that terrorize the Thicket. The [[gnomes]] allow the characters into the forest if the adventurers slay the plant monsters.

### Vergesson Sanatorium

During the war between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Julous Dominion]], a vast prison known as the Archevault was made as a jail for prisoners of war. After the war, the Archevault was repurposed by the [[Cerberus Assembly]] as the largest imperial sanatorium and hospital. Named after Lord Symon Vergesson, the late [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] member who founded it, the massive mansion is surrounded by vast gardens and filled with beautiful artwork designed to please the primarily wealthy patients.

The sanatorium's patients are treated for physical and mental ailments severe enough to require alchemical, magical, or experimental therapy. Helmed by Gertrude Wagner, the Sanatorium Director, the faculty is monitored by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. The facility offers treatment to those who require assistance and can pay handsomely, but beneath the pleasant mansion lies a torturous oubliette for political prisoners.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-12.png)

[[Vergesson Sanatorium]]

While the reputation of the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]] is sterling, it hides dark secrets. The original purpose of the Archevault was never fully discarded, and a number of vocal critics of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] have disappeared from the streets of [[Rexxentrum]]. Deep beneath the floors of the estate lie hidden chambers and cells that house enemies of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], foreign spies, and traitors to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] privately sentenced by [[Prime Arbiter]] [[Sydnock Truscan]]. There, they are subjected to experiments conducted in secret under the supervision of Master [[Trent Ikithon]] of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. A tower on the northern outskirts of the grounds acts as Trent's summer home, where he houses and trains the prospective members of his Volstruckers, an elite group of spies and assassins who use magic to do the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]'s dirty work.

Most who adventure in the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]] are trying to free a prisoner. Just finding a captive hidden in the massive complex is a challenge, but if the characters become imprisoned in the Archevault themselves, they must survive and form a plan to escape.

_**Killing Regin (Mid Level).**_ Regin Kavla (lawful evil, female, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)), a former spy for [[the Myriad]], is trapped in the bowels of the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]]. Worried that she might share important secrets, [[the Myriad]] hires the characters to get into the prison, capture Regin, and delivered her to them, offering a hefty sum or some other reward — whatever it takes to get the job done. As the characters search for Regin, they uncover the hospital's dark secrets and must decide what to do with this disturbing information.

_**Patient Zero (High Level).**_ One of the most trusted allies of [[Prime Arbiter]] [[Sydnock Truscan]], Doctor Reynold Brueska, has been privately developing an arcane disease to be used in the war against the [[Kryn Dynasty]], with the sanatorium's patients as his test subjects. When all contact with the sanatorium ceases, the [[Prime Arbiter]] hires the characters to investigate the premises and uncover the doctor, his work, and the events that transpired. The characters discover that a majority of the denizens of the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]] have been mutated and driven mad by the disease. The adventurers must fight their way through the horror-filled halls while trying to avoid contamination, or discover a cure before the disease completely corrupts them.

### Yrrosa

**Population:** 3,220 (54% [[humans]], 28% [[dwarves]], 14% [[elves]], 4% other [[races]])

**Government:** [[Bertrand Dwendal|The Crown]]'s will is imposed by [[Starosta]] Zulla Sauer, in tandem with the local noble families.

**Defense:** [[Yrrosa]] is protected by a battalion of [[Crownsguard]] supplemented by mercenaries.

**Commerce:** An older and smaller trade post, the town has basic equipment and supplies available for trade or purchase. Rooms and taverns are humble, but available.

**Organizations:** A temple to [[Bahamut]] looms over smaller shrines to the other [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods. [[The Myriad]] was once headquartered here; in its absence, the local businesses are entirely independent.

Once a snowy outpost between [[Icehaven]] and [[Rexxentrum]], [[Yrrosa]] has slowly grown into a sizable township where travelers and traders warm themselves as they pass through the frigid fields. The town is comprised of humble homesteads and numerous inns that promote themselves as "the hearth before the hoarfrost."

Recently, adventurers and fortune-seekers have flocked to the area to aid in the excavation of the nearby [[Ruins of Shattengrod]] (described earlier in this chapter).

Eighty years ago, a trapper guild turned smuggling gang was ousted from [[Icehaven]] and came to [[Yrrosa]] to seek better fortune. Life was no easier, and the crew of hungry rogues was forced to become creative. Noticing the lack of oversight from the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], they began to build a network of like-minded individuals throughout [[Western Wynandir]]. Taking the name "[[the Myriad]]," they helmed illegal activity from the comfort of this small outpost town until fifteen years ago, when their base of operations was discovered and raided by imperial forces. The remaining [[The Myriad|Myriad]] leaders have scattered, but the shadow of their operation still looms over [[Yrrosa]] like a dark cloud.

The previous [[starosta]], Stefan Weberrat, was arrested fifteen years ago for protecting [[the Myriad]]. His successor, Zulla Sauer, is the willful and respected daughter of Petrov Sauer, a mining baron in [[Druvenlode]]. She was chosen after she volunteered for the position, but unknown to most, she was already involved with [[the Myriad]] long before she became a [[starosta]]. She now helps inform their hidden network from a position of safety.

Petty crimes occur, but most stem from disagreements or competition over parties using [[Yrrosa]] as a base of operations while delving into the [[Ruins of Shattengrod]]. Unbeknownst to all but their allies, [[the Myriad]] has been slowly carving out new bases, and in time, they might grow bold enough to reclaim their old hideout.

Ramshackle wooden domiciles with snow-covered roofs line muddy streets throughout the town. The main roads were more improvised than planned, and most of the older buildings are in varying states of disrepair. Where Pride's Walk Road intersects with Havenpath Road is a cluster of taverns, inns, liveries, and stores.

The shadow of [[the Myriad]] hanging over [[Yrrosa]] makes it a fine place for intrigue, and the many travelers moving through the town have rumors and jobs to share with adventurers.

_**Blood Pact (High Level).**_ A [[Humans|human]] blacksmith named Wilhelm Arrisgon never returned from his latest journey to collect a wagon of raw materials. Wilhelm's family hires the characters to find the smith, and they trace him to [[Yrrosa]]. During their investigation, the characters discover that several other solitary travelers have disappeared while passing through the city. Velima Shanglian, a [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) who lives in a hidden lair outside [[Yrrosa]], turned the travelers into her [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn). [[The Myriad]] has a deal with the vampire and sends victims her way in exchange for help with various unsavory tasks. If the characters destroy the vampire, they make an enemy of [[the Myriad]].
