### High Curator Yudala Fon, Herald of the [[Rexxentrum]] Archive

_Lawful good, agender half-elf_

Yudala is a wise and respected figure who has spent most of their life fighting to protect and maintain the [[Rexxentrum]] Archive. They have mastered the art of parrying [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]’s and the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]’s attempts to subjugate the Archive and bring it under state control. For nearly two decades, they have been engaged in a battle of wills with the infuriated Theolocrat [[Kon Bruda]] — and they fear that Kon’s patience is at an end. His vengeance will be elaborate, exacting, and swift, or so Yudala fears. Their network of spies and [[expositors]] is frantically seeking to find and publicize evidence of Kon’s unlawful dealings and end the feud before it escalates further.
