### Expositor Sia Kresh

_Neutral, female halfling_

As [[Yudala Fon]]â€™s secret right-hand, Sia organizes the expositors of the [[Rexxentrum]] Archive. She is determined to root out the infiltrators who would seek to undermine the leadership of the Library and grab power for the Crown, and she is swift and brutal in her work. Those that know of her fear her, and many wonder if her methods are crossing a line.
