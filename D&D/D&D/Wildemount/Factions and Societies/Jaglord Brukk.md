### Ironeye Jaglord Brukk

_Lawful evil, male hobgoblin_

A feared warlord who guides a nomadic band of Lolthite hobgoblin warriors, Jaglord honed the skills of his marauders in the broken lands of the [[Barbed Fields]], where they brazenly attacked [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] trade caravans and supply wagons before vanishing into the deadly fields. As his war band grew larger and more capable, he boldly led them farther south, eventually coming to rest within [[the Ghostlands]] outside [[Rosohna]], where they now patiently await further orders from the Spider Queen.
