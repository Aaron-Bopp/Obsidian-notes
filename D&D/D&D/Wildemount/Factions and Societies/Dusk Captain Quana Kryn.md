### Dusk Captain Quana Kryn

_Neutral good, female dark elf_

An extremely powerful [[echo knight]] and general of the forces of [[Rosohna]], Quana has been Leylas’s partner for three of her lifetimes, and five of Leylas’s. She is wholly devoted to her people — and her queen. Quana holds a private hope that the Kryn might one day leave the inhospitable wastes of [[Xhorhas]] and find a proper place in the world among the other peoples of [[Exandria]]. The Bright Queen was once receptive to her ideas, but Leylas Kryn has no time for idealism in this age of war. Quana is disappointed, but she is more worried by the strange shifts in her partner’s usually wise and controlled demeanor.
