Zhafe is a distant relative of Lord [[Athesias Uludan]] of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]; his placement within the [[Clovis Concord|concord]] was primarily a diplomatic concession to maintain a positive relationship with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. However, Zhafe shuns this notion, insisting that he earned his role on his own merits, and eagerly organizing small galas and parades to ensure his popularity among the citizens of [[Nicodranas]]. Even so, he secretly fears the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] and bows to Athesiasâ€™s requests whenever they meet, making him a useful pawn.
