### Olesya Lapidus, Marquis of [[Port Damali]]

_Neutral good, female human_

The Lapidus familyâ€™s work in protecting and continuing the prosperity of the city for four generations has kept a Lapidus as Marquis of [[Port Damali]] for just as long. Olesya was raised as a boy, but quickly discovered that she identified as female and transitioned in her youth. As the fourth and current leader of Port Damali, Olesya takes pride in her charge and is respected by the rest of the concord. However, with the growing distraction of [[the Revelry]], Olesya failed to notice the infestation of [[The Myriad|Myriad]] agents throughout her city and the guilds beneath her. Now realizing the dangerous web surrounding her and the interests of her city, she is seeking a way to turn the tide.
