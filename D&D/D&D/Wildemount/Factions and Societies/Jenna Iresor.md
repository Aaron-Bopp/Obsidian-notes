### Baroness Jenna Iresor, Archmage of Industry

_Neutral doppelganger_

One of the younger members of the assembly, Jenna is known for her business acumen and her extravagant lifestyle. By hiding her nature as a doppelganger and using memory-altering magics at a young age to fabricate a false past, Jenna constructed her human persona from the ground up, leveraging her powers of deception to essentially write herself into history as a [[Clovis Concord]] expatriate. She helps oversee central guild business in [[Rexxentrum]] under Guildmaster [[Kai Arness]], and helps Exchequer [[Aethia Drooze]] organize the collection of tithes through starostas across the empire.
