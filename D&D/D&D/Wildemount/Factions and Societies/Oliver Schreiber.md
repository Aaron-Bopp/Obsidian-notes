### Oliver Schreiber, Retainer to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]

_Lawful neutral, male gnome_

Most know Oliver as the immediate head servant to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] and the royal family for nearly three generations, but Oliver is also the secret head of the [[Augen Trust]], [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]’s elite spy network. The [[Augen Trust]] uses extreme secrecy, false identities, and infiltration into allied and opposing societies to acquire information and inform [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] of any threats to its goals. As one of the most trusted members of King [[Bertrand Dwendal]]’s circle, Oliver holds more power than his compatriots would believe.
