# Dwendalian Empire

The Dwendalian Empire has reigned over [[Western Wynandir]] for over twelve generations. Imperial rule is maintained through its powerful military, its policy of religious restriction, and the support of the secretive [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Though these institutions nominally exist to ensure the safety of the populace from foreign threats, terrible dangers that wander the wilds, and lingering evils that seep from the scars of [[the Calamity]], they also allow the empire to maintain strict social order within its territories.

King [[Bertrand Dwendal]] is now two months past his sixty-eighth birthday, and his iron will has not wavered with age. A tall, powerful man, King Dwendal rewards loyalty and swiftly punishes insolence and failure. His family has developed a totalitarian rule that reaps heavy taxes and looms over society with a military presence that only grows stronger with proximity to the capital city of [[Rexxentrum]]. While civic unrest does rise beyond mere mutterings from time to time, reminders of the dangerous creatures that live beyond the guarded borders of each city and the protections offered within the empire generally keep the populace in line. Those that rebel often find themselves in chains or forgotten in a dungeon.

Dwendalian society has a rigid caste system, in which denizens who have mastery over the arcane are considered elite members of society. Many Dwendalian ladies and lords came from a sorcerous bloodline or studied the arcane arts within the walls of the Soltryce Academy. Those who especially excel in their magics or were born into prominent families can come to hold power as a member of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], a council of extremely powerful mages that works directly with King Dwendal and his councilors to develop and enforce laws throughout [[Western Wynandir]]. However, distrust between the king and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] runs deep, for they both wish to eliminate the other and enjoy uncontested power.

Most cities and townships throughout the empire are ruled by a local government under the leadership of a starosta, usually a native baron appointed by the Crown and the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Reporting directly to the king’s council, the starosta is given absolute control over local government, appointing and maintaining responsibility for the heads of the city guard (watchmaster), the regional military (warmaster), local commerce (coinmaster), infrastructure (pithmaster), religious practices (idolmaster), and the courts of law (lawmaster). Twice a year, tithe collectors (nicknamed “Reapers”) visit each imperial city to inspect households for records and proof of income, collecting a percentage of their earnings in coin as determined by the tithe collector.

The empire’s military force currently stands at around 35,300 Righteous Brand soldiers across all regiments, and 5,200 [[Crownsguard]] across all cities. The majority of the Righteous Brand forces were deployed to fortifications along the Xhorhasian border at the onset of the current war.

Soon after the Dwendalian bloodline came into power, there was a short-lived rebellion helmed by religious civilians. It was swiftly quelled and the rebel leaders were executed in an event known as the Admonition. The ruling class has regarded religion with suspicion ever since, believing that faith inspires the unworthy to rise above their station and spark fruitless rebellion. Instead of abolishing all religious practices, the empire regulates worship within its boundaries. All temples are owned and run by the government, and must be dedicated to deities approved by the Crown. Priests and clerics are on the Crown’s payroll to preach only approved religious texts. Keeping private shrines or worshiping outside official temples is punishable by fines or imprisonment. The only deities that are approved by the empire are [[Erathis]] the Law Bearer, [[Bahamut]] the Platinum Dragon, [[Moradin]] the All-Hammer, [[Pelor]] the Dawn Father, [[Ioun]] the Knowing Mentor, and [[The Raven Queen]].

## Goals

The empire uses the plentiful resources of the [[Marrow Valley]] and sizable tithes gathered from citizens to protect their people and maintain control over [[Western Wynandir]], while keeping a keen eye out for opportunities to expand their influence across the continent.

The empire’s religious proscriptions are proving more and more difficult to enforce in this time of conflict. Theolocrat [[Kon Bruda]] is helming a new directive to align religious texts with less oppressive terminology, in an attempt to redirect discontent away from the Crown and onto the heretics beyond the borders.

Now that tensions with [[Xhorhas]] have erupted into all-out war with the [[Kryn Dynasty]], the Crown is spreading propaganda through all aspects of daily life to unite the people of the empire against their common enemy. They hope to garner support for the war by reinforcing rumors about the kidnapping of Dwendalian children and the Kryn’s violent and cannibalistic nature.

## Relationships

Though many citizens gripe about the empire’s restrictive laws, the majority have grown accustomed to a comfortable lifestyle under imperial protection. Fear of the evils that stalk the edges of civilization generally outweighs any frustrations about civil liberties, and the relative peace provided within the confines of [[Western Wynandir]] is welcomed. However, dissidents have begun to speak loudly of their discontent, and the growing trend of uproar is making King Dwendal quite irritable.

Landlocked and reliant on the trade avenues of the [[Menagerie Coast]], the Dwendalian Empire maintains a respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with the [[Clovis Concord]]. Agents of both nations watch the borders, and an occasional political gesture of good faith satisfies those in power. Still, the empire doesn’t trust the concord by any stretch of the imagination, and a secret world of subterfuge is alive and well.

Historically, the [[Cerberus Assembly]] has been responsible for much of the empire’s acquisition and retention of power, but the royal bloodline has always harbored a paranoid dislike of the council of mages. Handshakes and smiles hide distrust, and the king correctly assumes that the assembly is merely biding their time to attempt to challenge his power.

The King and his chamber ignore most foreign powers. Requests for alliances from the Council of Tal’Dorei and the distant city of Ank’Harel have been met with indifference, and efforts to install a skyport in [[Rexxentrum]] to enable easier foreign travel have been continuously shut down.
