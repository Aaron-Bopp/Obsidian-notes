### High Curator Loman Turray, Herald of the [[Zadash]] Archive

_Lawful neutral, male human_

Curator Turray has held the position of High Curator of the Valley Archive in [[Zadash]] and the title of Herald of the Archive under [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] for over forty years. He faces increasing pressure to instill his subordinates with loyalty to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], and he is slowly giving in to imperial indoctrination. He fears that enforcing the will of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] when it contradicts the philosophies of the Library will cause his own colleagues to depose him — which only leads him further into [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]’s protective embrace.
