### Bright Queen Leylas [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]]

_Lawful neutral, female dark elf_

Leylas was present when the first beacon was found a millennium ago, and has lived eight lifetimes of intense struggle and self-discovery since. She built the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] around her journey, spearheaded the recovery of the four beacons known to the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], and died numerous times in the defense of her people. Leylas [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] is deeply revered and respected as a mighty warrior, an empathic leader, and the elder [[Umavi]] who guides her people in the light of [[the Luxon]]. Her behavior has grown erratic at times, worrying her trusted inner circle, but she is far too driven to acknowledge such weakness in a time of war.
