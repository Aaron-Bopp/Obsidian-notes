### Lord Athesias Uludan, Archmage of Diplomatic Union

_Neutral good, male human_

Athesias’s charm and bombastic personality serve him well as a diplomat. His duty is to foster a positive relationship with people of power both within and beyond the borders of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. He was originally one of the most effective instructors at the Soltryce Academy, but his penchant for spectacle and his rampant narcissism made him a difficult ally to trust with state secrets. When the office of Diplomatic Union opened, he was quickly and quietly reassigned. Athesias finds great pleasure in ruining or usurping the plans of his counterpart in [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]’s employ, Emissary Lord [[Zeddan Graf]].
