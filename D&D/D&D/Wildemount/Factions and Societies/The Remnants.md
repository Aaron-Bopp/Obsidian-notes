### The Remnants
When [[Vecna]]’s physical form was destroyed during the [[Age of Arcanum]], his most devoted followers founded the Remnants, a collection of secretive sects dedicated to realizing Vecna’s plan to ascend to godhood, despite his death. The cult succeeded in aiding his resurrection and ascension, but they were scattered when the heroes of Vox Machina banished and sealed Vecna beyond the [[Divine Gate]]. The Remnants now seek new ways to restore their god to his promised position of absolute dominance over creation.
