### Doctor Waldorf Perifeather

_Lawful evil, male halfling_

A talented physician and healer, Waldorf often travels between [[Port Damali]] and [[Zadash]], tending to affluent patients with rare diseases. His proximity to powerful figures in their most vulnerable moments grants the good doctor a source of highly sensitive information and a reputation as a savior. This combination of influence and access makes him a key information broker for [[the Myriad]].
