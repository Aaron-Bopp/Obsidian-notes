### Head Matron Vivurk Tonn

_Neutral evil, female dark elf_

Vivurk commands the drow houses and the hobgoblin horde that claim the mountainside stronghold of [[Dumaran]]. She rules with a bloody, iron fist in the image of her god to impose the same love and fear that characterized the drow societies of old. Ruthless and demanding, Head Matron Vivurk builds, trains, and prepares her forces to one day help [[Lolth]] strike down the [[Kryn Dynasty]] with delicious brutality.
