Just over a hundred and twenty years old and still within his first life, Essek is a prodigy who displays an unprecedented talent for the manipulation of [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] energy. Essek is both respected and feared for his intelligence and cunning, and he carefully plots each step he takes to further his and his [[Den]]â€™s climb up the hierarchy of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]. Essek is more interested in [[Dunamancy]] magic than worshiping [[the Luxon]], and he is strangely excited for the war with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. He is eager to use the conflict as an excuse to practice the deadlier aspects of [[Dunamancy]], and also curious to see what the powerful minds of the [[Cerberus Assembly]] may have gleaned from their research into the beacon they stole.
