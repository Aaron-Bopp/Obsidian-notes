Once a monk of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]], Kon Brudaâ€™s faith in the [[Ioun|Knowing Mentor]] has waned since accepting the office of Theolocrat. Kon is a specialist in the historical and social workings of modern religion. When the previous Theolocrat passed away, he accepted the post out of a sense of duty, then became accustomed to the lavish lifestyle afforded by his position. He helps [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] alter existing religious texts and write approved sermons and prayers for distribution throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].
