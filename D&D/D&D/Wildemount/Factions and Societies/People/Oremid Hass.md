**Allignment**:: Lawful neutral
**Gender**:: male
**Race**:: earth [[genasi]]

The current headmaster of the Hall of Erudition in [[Zadash]], Oremid is tasked with watching and grooming the next generation of mages and arcane specialists outside [[Rexxentrum]]. While he himself is a gentle soul who adores animals, he puts on the façade of a strict man with no sense of humor, which is further enhanced by the elemental influence of his earth [[genasi]] blood. He teaches students that failure is not an option, and that emotion is a barrier to one’s true ability. Equally feared, respected, and privately loathed by the students (and some instructors), Oremid personally dismisses those who break under his school’s curriculum and heaps joyous praise on those who endure their training.
