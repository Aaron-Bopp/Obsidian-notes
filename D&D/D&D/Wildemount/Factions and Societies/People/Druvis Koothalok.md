Once a trained combatant in [[Dragonborn|draconblood]] gladiatorial games, Druvis gained notoriety when he refused to strike his foes dead. His skill and creed garnered attention, and he was quickly sold to a wealthy noble house atop the floating islands of [[Draconia]]. In the chaos after [[Draconia]]â€™s fall, Druvis became widely respected for his courage and sense of morality, and has hesitantly become a champion for the downtrodden people of [[Xarzith Kitril]].
