Known for his skills in negotiation and deceit, Ionos has proven himself the master of the family’s distribution network. Inspired to expand the business alliances of the Jagentoth family far beyond the northern edges of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], Ionos has been making arrangements with [[The Myriad|Myriad]] operatives while simultaneously rooting out [[The Myriad|Myriad]] influence in those same circles. Either the noose is about to tighten, or he’s designed a brilliant ploy to eliminate the competition.
