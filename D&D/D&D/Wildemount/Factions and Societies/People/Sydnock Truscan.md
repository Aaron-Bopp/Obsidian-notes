**Allignment**:: Lawful evil
**Gender**:: male
**Race**:: [[Humans|human]]

The [[Truscan family]] are longtime allies of the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] bloodline, and Sydnock managed to advance his family’s influence within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] above most other noble houses. Rising to become the [[Prime Arbiter]] of [[Rexxentrum]], Sydnock has final say on all matters of law that do not require [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]’s attention. A brutal man with a grudge against religious empowerment, Sydnock is constantly attempting to sniff out corruption within the approved structure of worship within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. His estranged daughter [[Lydia Truscan]] disagrees with his ruthless methods and now lives in [[Zadash]] as an advocate for civilian rights.
