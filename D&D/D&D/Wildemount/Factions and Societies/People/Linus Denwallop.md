A wandering minstrel who claims a sourceless knighthood, Sir Linus travels all across the [[Menagerie Coast]] with his lyre and bag of illusions to astound and excite the children and poor folk of the countryside. Sir Linus intends to make up for his years of villainy as a smuggler and thief by subtly undermining the same sects of [[The Myriad]] with whom he once did business.
