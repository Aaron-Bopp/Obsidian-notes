### Jagoda Uttolot

_Chaotic evil, male half-orc_

Jagoda is a master hunter and expert on the terrifying beasts that wander through the [[Savalirwood]], using his skills to track and capture rare creatures for his family to sell. Gleeful in his brutality and prone to ignore the graces of diplomatic relations, Jagoda has occasionally gotten himself into trouble that the rest of his family has had to dig him out of.
