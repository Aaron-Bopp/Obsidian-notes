### Alamads Haddou, Marquis of [[Port Zoon]]

_Neutral good, male dwarf_

The old, crotchety, and honorable leader of the industrial city of [[Port Zoon]], and head of the Silverbone Smithing Guild that operates all along the coast, Alamads is widely known for his insurmountable will and strong sense of duty to his people. As a former Shore Warden and a legendary ironsmith, his skill with a hammer — both on and off the battlefield — has earned him great respect, as well as the whispered nickname of “Ironpuss.”
