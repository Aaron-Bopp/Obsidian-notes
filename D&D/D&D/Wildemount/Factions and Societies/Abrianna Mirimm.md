### Skysybil Abrianna Mirimm

_Lawful neutral, female goblin_

Seen by many within the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] as a talented diviner and voice of reason, Abrianna is an [[Umavi]] nearly as old as the Bright Queen herself. The beloved Skysybil has spent her current lifetime as a [[Goblinkin|goblin]], a fact that has drawn both ire and jests from the Bright Queen’s court for decades. This experience has given Abrianna a new perspective on the [[wastefolk]] under the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]’s banner; she is now one of the few councilors in the [[Lucid Bastion]] who bother to vouch for the [[goblinkin]].
