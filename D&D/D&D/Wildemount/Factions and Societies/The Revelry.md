# The Revelry

The Revelry’s allies within the [[Clovis Concord]] will tell you that they turned to piracy because of the [[Clovis Concord|concord]]’s excessive taxes and unjust laws. Perhaps it began that way, but over time, a movement that began as public dissent turned to lawful protest, which then became violent action. Eventually, a union of disenfranchised salvage ships and trade vessels fought their way into the Dragshallow Reef and violently overthrew the small sanctuary port of [[Darktow]].

After establishing a lawless base of operations on the isle of [[Darktow]], these pirates began stalking the well-known shipping routes of the [[Menagerie Coast]] to harry, intimidate, steal from, and destroy passing ships that flew under the [[Clovis Concord|concord]]’s banner. Calling themselves The Revelry, these “free folk of the sea” have now spent over forty years terrorizing the Lucidian Ocean. With loose morals and a twisted code of honor, they take what they want from less protected targets while living a life of debauchery in the well-guarded haven of [[Darktow]]. The Revelry lacks a uniform symbol, instead changing the colors and symbols of its banner regularly to avoid counterfeiting and infiltration.

The Revelry is governed by a collective of captains, all of whom defer to the final word of [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]], a capricious monarch who never leaves [[Darktow]]. The original Plank King, [[Hunnis Breeah]], ruled for twenty-five years before a [[Goliaths|goliath]] named [[Wyatt Maranoss]] challenged him for his increasingly lackadaisical attitude — and won. Now Breeah is dead, and Wyatt claims the title of Plank King.
## Goals

While the Revelry’s original goal was to scare the [[Clovis Concord|concord]] into revoking their soaring taxes, its charter has changed. The [[Clovis Concord]] refused to change its laws, and the pirates found a certain dark joy in theft and murder on the waves. The original members of the Revelry (and now their children) have no plans to return to their former lives as legitimate traders. They intend to maintain and grow their operations across the Lucidian Ocean, while continuing to defend and improve their fortress in [[Darktow]], finding intricate ways of reinforcing the reefs with dangerous traps and impassable barriers.

The Revelry has since expanded their interests beyond mere piracy. Relics and secrets dating back to the [[Age of Arcanum]] and beyond are rumored to be scattered all across the coast and the [[Swavain Islands]]. Some scavengers have returned to [[Darktow]] with proof of such artifacts, and a new kind of aspiring treasure seeker has emerged within the Revelry: one who seeks to plunder from the dead rather than the living. The drive to outdo their fellow sailors has already placed several ships in serious danger.

## Relationships

Each member of the Revelry known to the [[Clovis Concord]] is considered a major criminal, amassing an ever-growing bounty with each infraction they commit and every ship they raid. Those arrested are generally executed and strapped to the rocks outside [[Brokenbank]] as a warning.

Some of the more affluent Marquesian merchant guilds that have little investment in [[Clovis Concord|concord]] shipments use back-channels to pay off the Revelry and fly specific colors when crossing their territory to avoid being boarded.
