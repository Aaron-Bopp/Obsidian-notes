### Theolocrat Kon Bruda

_Lawful neutral, male human_

Once a monk of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]], Kon Brudaâ€™s faith in the Knowing Mentor has waned since accepting the office of Theolocrat. Kon is a specialist in the historical and social workings of modern religion. When the previous Theolocrat passed away, he accepted the post out of a sense of duty, then became accustomed to the lavish lifestyle afforded by his position. He helps the Crown alter existing religious texts and write approved sermons and prayers for distribution throughout the empire.
