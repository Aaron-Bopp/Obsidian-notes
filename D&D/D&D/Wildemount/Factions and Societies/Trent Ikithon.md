### Master Trent Ikithon, Archmage of Civic Influence

_Chaotic evil, male human_

Trent is respected as the acclaimed Propagandist of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and the third oldest member of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]. Once an instructor at the Soltryce Academy, he only returns every few years to collect young students for his experiments in the mental conditioning that he calls “awakening.” Many of these students go mad and are locked away, but those who endure become zealots for the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] and join the Volstrucker, an elite group of arcane thugs commonly known as Scourgers, who perform the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]’s dirtiest work under Trent’s direction.
