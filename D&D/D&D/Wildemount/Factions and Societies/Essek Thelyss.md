### Shadowhand Essek Thelyss

_Neutral evil, male dark elf_

Just over a hundred and twenty years old and still within his first life, Essek is a prodigy who displays an unprecedented talent for the manipulation of [[dunamis]] energy. Essek is both respected and feared for his intelligence and cunning, and he carefully plots each step he takes to further his and his Denâ€™s climb up the hierarchy of the dynasty. Essek is more interested in [[dunamancy]] magic than worshiping [[the Luxon]], and he is strangely excited for the war with the empire. He is eager to use the conflict as an excuse to practice the deadlier aspects of dunamancy, and also curious to see what the powerful minds of the [[Cerberus Assembly]] may have gleaned from their research into the beacon they stole.
