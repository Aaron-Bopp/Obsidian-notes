### Master Duasad Keef

_Chaotic good, male human_

An affluent noble among the upper crust of the [[Clovis Concord]], Duasad is an inheritor of the Keef family’s ancient, generational wealth. Duasad was raised as a woman, but realized as a young adult that something wasn’t right, and sought a mage to help him transition — a fairly simple task in the concord, at least for those with affluence.

These days, Duasad has become well known as a powerful empath who uses his psychic talents to help others deal with trauma or seek a more fulfilling path in life. He has become one of the most influential and effective members of the [[Golden Grin]] in [[Wildemount]]. However, the radical shifts in his clients’ life choices have not gone unnoticed, and Duasad is aware that the watchful gaze of the [[Clovis Concord]] is now firmly fixed on him.
