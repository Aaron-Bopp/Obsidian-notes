### Skysybil Abrianna Mirimm

_Lawful neutral, female goblin_

Seen by many within the dynasty as a talented diviner and voice of reason, Abrianna is an Umavi nearly as old as the Bright Queen herself. The beloved Skysybil has spent her current lifetime as a goblin, a fact that has drawn both ire and jests from the Bright Queen’s court for decades. This experience has given Abrianna a new perspective on the wastefolk under the dynasty’s banner; she is now one of the few councilors in the Lucid Bastion who bother to vouch for the goblinkin.
