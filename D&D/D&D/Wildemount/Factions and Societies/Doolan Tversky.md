The second-oldest member of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]], Doolan is in charge of the study and understanding of abnormal creatures and deviants of arcane creation that might threaten the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]â€™s way of life. She is an absentminded yet brilliant [[Gnomes|gnome]] who is obsessed with all beasts, aberrations, and creatures of legend. Doolan imports creatures from around the world to study, disassemble, and use in her attempts to revolutionize magical practices. She resents the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul]], as her reputation has caused them to bar her from their facilities.
