### Iris Bethelas

_Lawful evil, female human_

This lovely, elderly woman is deeply respected and beloved for her wise, spiritual guidance and seemingly gentle demeanor. This persona kept her safe in [[Yrrosa]], and now in [[Rexxentrum]], where she is one of the masterminds planning the return of [[the Myriad]]. Insightful, clever, and unhesitating in her cruelty, Iris has long been considered the driving force behind the Myriadâ€™s success.
