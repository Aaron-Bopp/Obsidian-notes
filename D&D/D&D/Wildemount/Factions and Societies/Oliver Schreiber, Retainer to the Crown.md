### Oliver Schreiber, Retainer to the Crown

_Lawful neutral, male gnome_

Most know Oliver as the immediate head servant to the king and the royal family for nearly three generations, but Oliver is also the secret head of the Augen Trust, the Crown’s elite spy network. The Augen Trust uses extreme secrecy, false identities, and infiltration into allied and opposing societies to acquire information and inform the Crown of any threats to its goals. As one of the most trusted members of [[King Bertrand Dwendal]]’s circle, Oliver holds more power than his compatriots would believe.
