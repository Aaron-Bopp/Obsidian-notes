### Vemosi Runek

_Chaotic neutral, female dragonborn_

Vemosi is a zealous and militant priest of the Storm Lord, and her tempestuous fervor and blistering sermons in the aftermath of [[Draconia]]’s fall made her a popular voice of the people, though her detractors call her little more than a demagogue. Vemosi’s brutal sense of justice has earned her — and the Storm Lord — many followers, all of whom are determined to hunt down and exact retribution from the surviving [[Dragonborn|draconbloods]]. Vemosi has become a powerful figure within the Scars, and now she seeks to cement her place as a leader of her people.
