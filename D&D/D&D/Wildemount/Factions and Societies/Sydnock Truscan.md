### Prime Arbiter Sydnock Truscan

_Lawful evil, male human_

The Truscan family are longtime allies of the Dwendalian bloodline, and Sydnock managed to advance his family’s influence within the empire above most other noble houses. Rising to become the Prime Arbiter of Rexxentrum, Sydnock has final say on all matters of law that do not require the king’s attention. A brutal man with a grudge against religious empowerment, Sydnock is constantly attempting to sniff out corruption within the approved structure of worship within the empire. His estranged daughter Lydia disagrees with his ruthless methods and now lives in Zadash as an advocate for civilian rights.
