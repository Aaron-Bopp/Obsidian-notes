### The Gentleman

_Neutral evil, male water genasi_

The Gentleman has held a position of influence in the shadows of [[Zadash]] for nearly two decades, using his charm and connections throughout the city to carve a sizeable niche for himself in the Underworks beneath the city. These days, heâ€™s respected as a suave crime lord with dozens of reliable cutthroats and thieves at his beck and call.
