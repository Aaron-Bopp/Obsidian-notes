# Clovis Concord

Nearly four hundred years ago, an alliance of [[Ki’Nau]] islanders and foreign Marquesian traders founded a new nation on the tropical [[Menagerie Coast]]. The Clovis Concord is a democratic nation that enforces law and order, and regulates commerce along the length of the coast. The nation is composed of eight independent city-states, each ruled by its own marquis, which operate as one union under the banner of the Clovis Concord. This arrangement ensures uniform laws, regulation of trade, and mutual protection between the city-states. These eight cities are [[Port Damali]], [[Port Zoon]], [[Gwardan]], [[Tussoa]], [[Othe]], [[Feolinn]], [[Nicodranas]], and [[Brokenbank]].

Open shipping lanes and inviting tropical scenery have made the domain of the Clovis Concord a cultural melting pot and a popular place to live or visit. Knowing this, the respective marquises uphold a long tradition of welcoming all weary travelers and providing an atmosphere of color and delight. If there is gold to be spent, the concord is eager for you to spend it within their cities. Between the venues for entertainment and vice, and the ample business opportunities, the concord hopes to convince those with wealth to spend it here, outside the gates of the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

Internally, each marquis of the Clovis Concord keeps a tight grip on the shipping and trade that comes though their cities, overseeing all guilds that organize imports and exports and managing a handful of guildmasters that form the backbone of local commerce. When a marquis dies or is impeached by the other members of the concord, the remaining members choose a successor.

Warriors who prove their might through gladiatorial bouts during times of celebration and ceremony are asked to join the [[Zhelezo]], a well-paid guard force that works for the governing marquis to enforce the laws. Cities have one or more magistrates that oversee judgment on legal matters and criminal punishment.

While the cities do work together for the good of the concord, they are also each in silent competition with each other, flaunting their affluence and clientele at every opportunity. When a prominent figure from the far reaches of [[Exandria]] finds their way to the [[Menagerie Coast]], it’s not uncommon for them to be courted by multiple marquises in an attempt to convince the personage to stay as a guest of their city.

In recent times, [[the Myriad]] has subtly infiltrated the Clovis Concord, often with the unwitting aid of greedy local politicians. Rumors of criminal collusion have raised suspicion amid members of the concord. Sooner or later, the tension will have to break — and the fallout won’t be pretty.

Clovis Concord Crest

Despite the concord’s cordial relationship with the [[Dwendalian Empire]], their proximity to the imperial power is a lingering source of unease. Currently, the concord maintains a standing military of 7,800 Shore Warden soldiers across the coast, a nautical fleet of 370 ships, and 5,200 [[Zhelezo]] divided between the cities. Some of the Shore Wardens are posted inland, scattered around and within the [[Cyrios Mountains]], where they maintain forts along the border with [[Western Wynandir]] and the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

## Goals

The Clovis Concord is concerned with maintaining the trade and commerce that ensures their continued influence, both in [[Wildemount]] and the rest of [[Exandria]]. Anything that might jeopardize business is viewed as a major threat to the sanctity of life along the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Faced with the hazards of dangerous creatures that lurk in the nearby jungles and beneath the waves, as well as piracy on the open waters, the concord is employing substantial numbers of adventurers and mercenaries.

Forty years ago, when the concord worked to enforce rising taxation on independent merchant companies operating within the [[Menagerie Coast]], the outrage led a small union of angry enterprises to turn to piracy, calling themselves [[the Revelry]]. These pirates have claimed the island of [[Darktow]] and terrorized the shipping lanes for four decades, all while deftly avoiding pursuit and naval retribution. The concord is eager to destroy [[the Revelry]] in its entirety, and have put massive bounties on the heads of the so-called scourges of the ocean.

## Relationships

After the fall of the Julous Dominion and the rise of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the concord was eager to reach a diplomatic arrangement with the victorious empire. The empire recognized the difficulty of conquering the Clovis Concord and the challenge of managing their immense network of international trade, and acquiesced to a treaty. This loose alliance has been mutually beneficial for many generations, and the concord city of [[Nicodranas]] acts as a common ground for people of both nations. Both imperial [[Crownsguard]] and local [[Zhelezo]] keep the peace in [[Nicodranas]], and both imperial and concord laws hold sway within the city. While this arrangement occasionally causes strain between the two governments, the marquises of the concord are happy to have the buffer of the empire between them and the ravenous wastes of [[Xhorhas]]. As the war between the empire and [[Xhorhas]] continues to grow, the concord is determined to stay neutral. This has caused some tension with the empire, but nothing the concord worries will overshadow their long-standing treaty.
