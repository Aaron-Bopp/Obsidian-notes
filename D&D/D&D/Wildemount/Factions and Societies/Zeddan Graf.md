**Allignment**:: Neutral good
**Gender**:: male
**Race**:: [[Humans|human]]

A beloved noble and socialite from the House of Graf, Zeddan showed prowess in gathering rumors for his own entertainment. The cunning [[Sydnock Truscan]] saw promise in Zeddan’s talents and recommended him to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] to become the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s lead emissary. Now acting as the diplomatic contact to the world beyond the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s boundaries, Zeddan is eager to do [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]’s bidding while rooting out gossip that may prove politically expedient. In his travels, Lord Zeddan often crosses paths with Lord [[Athesias Uludan]] of the [[Cerberus Assembly]], and the pair loathe each other deeply. Zeddan is desperately trying to convince [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] to install a Skyship Tower in [[Rexxentrum]] to make his travels easier.
