As a decorated veteran of the imperial military who has served for nearly twenty years, Hayden is a highly respected soldier and clever tactician who is instrumental in the campaign against the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. Known to be stern but adaptable in the face of adversity, they’ve risen through the ranks and now directly advise [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] on all major military actions. Hayden prefers to avoid court life, especially as their practicality often clashes with [[Sydnock Truscan]]’s cold cynicism. Currently assigned to oversee the defense of the besieged eastern front at the [[Rockguard Garrison]], [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] Marshal is doing their best to keep their soldiers safe and the enemy at bay.
