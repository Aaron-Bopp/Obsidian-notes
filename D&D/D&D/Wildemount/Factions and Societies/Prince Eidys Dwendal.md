### Prince Eidys Dwendal

_Neutral good, male human_

Heir to the throne of the empire, Eidys has shown great strength in physical combat and war games, but little cunning in social or political matters. Though he was once eager to please his father, the consistent lack of approval has left Eidys jaded. Happy to live an extravagant life free from crushing responsibility, heâ€™s been eager to produce a child to whom he could abdicate should his father pass. However, he and his wife, [[Princess Suria Dwendal]], have been unable to conceive. The king has all but given up on his son, leaving the prince dejected and bitter.
