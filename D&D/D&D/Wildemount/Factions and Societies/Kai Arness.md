### Guildmaster Kai Arness

_Lawful evil, male human_

Kai came to prominence within [[Rexxentrum]] through the Arness family’s illustrious connections within the merchant guilds of the empire. He earned the nickname “Goldfang” for his penchant for sneaking missing profit from the pockets of businesses unable to pay membership fees and taxes. Respected and feared for ruthlessly governing the many guilds and organizations that drive the Dwendalian economy, his private worship of [[Asmodeus]] guides his ambition to mingle with dangerous figures in the empire. The guildmaster often works with Exchequer Drooze to maintain the proper flow of gold into the coffers of the empire.
