Ludinus is the oldest and only original member of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]], as well as the master of warfare and conflict. Charged with overhauling the military structure of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], Ludinus directed the construction of the garrisons on the Xhorhasian border and often oversees their maintenance. He was one of the mages who survived the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]] and fled to [[Bysaes Tyl]], but he saw the opportunity to achieve greatness within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and left his culture behind to continue his arcane pursuits. Wise, if emotionless, he bears a deep hatred for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and spares no effort gathering information on their weaknesses and secrets. Ludinus spends most of his time developing arcane weapons of war and shoring up the military might of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], while subtly challenging the leadership of Crown Marshal Damurag.
