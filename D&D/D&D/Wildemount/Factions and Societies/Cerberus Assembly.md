# Cerberus Assembly
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

The Cerberus Assembly was established nearly three hundred years ago, when strife and competition between warring mage lords threatened to unravel the social order of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The house leaders of this conflict nearly destroyed one another in what was called [[the Eve of Crimson Midnight]], an arcane battle within the capital of [[Rexxentrum]] that leveled two wards of the city, killing hundreds of civilians. At the peak of the violence, a parlay was called, and the mage lords decided to put aside their differences and avoid mutually assured destruction, instead joining as a unified conclave. When brought before [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] for judgment of their crimes, they offered an accord to instead officially instate the conclave and submit entirely to king’s rule. Taking the name the Cerberus Assembly, a reference to a powerful, historical union of mages during the [[Age of Arcanum]], the mages took the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to new heights of power and expansion.

In the centuries since, the Cerberus Assembly has subtly ingrained itself within most facets of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s government, becoming a force of political and military power that many say could rival [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] himself. This reality is not lost on the royal council, and tensions often simmer between the assembly and [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]. The mages of the assembly are known for their extravagant lifestyles and intimidating history of political and economic control, and much of the populace mistrusts them, though no one dares to cross them or [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. There are eight ruling positions within the assembly, and the families of each member are appointed as lesser members without responsibility, called “annexes.” Mages of the assembly wander throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] with little fear of argument or resistance.

Members are elevated into one of the eight major offices on the death of a member that leaves an office vacant, or when a standing member abdicates their position. The remaining members then recommend replacements and vote on the mage to fill the newly open office.

## Goals

The assembly plays the long game, working to subtly increase its power across the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and beyond. Popular decisions are often publicly presented as the will of the assembly, while conflicted issues are tailored to seem purely the “will of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]],” driving a wedge between the two bodies. The assembly seeks to write history to favor its members as the architects of modern law and culture, with the eventual goal of subverting the power of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], turning him into yet another puppet of the assembly’s goals. Assembly mages believe that only they have the knowledge and talents to truly guide the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] into greatness.

Aside from political matters, the assembly is focused on locating and excavating powerful relics and magic lost to the [[Age of Arcanum]]. Its members believe that their original namesake was the apex of society across all history, and they seek to reclaim their place as paragons of mortal rule. Thus, all salvaged texts and artifacts of power from that era are to be recovered at all costs.

The curious discovery of the power behind the [[Kryn Dynasty]] has recently drawn much of the assembly’s attention. The mysterious, primal force known as [[dunamis]] could change the world’s understanding of magic itself — and could even be the key to placing the assembly above all other rulers and nations. In pursuit of this goal, agents of the assembly stole two Luxon beacons from the [[Kryn Dynasty]], though they subsequently lost one to a band of adventurers called the [[Mighty Nein]]. The assembly has dedicated immense effort to studying and exploiting this new form of magic, knowing full well that stealing the beacons is what caused the current war in the first place.

## Relationships

The assembly has worked directly with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] and his chamber for so long that the two factions have become deeply intertwined, frustrating both of them. Though they rely heavily on each other, every smile and agreement barely conceals an undercurrent of venomous loathing. Some members of the assembly feel that it is far too soon to overtly challenge [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], while others believe it would be foolish to miss the opportunity the war is creating.

The assembly has established itself as the more forward-thinking face of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to the outside world, with Lord [[Athesias Uludan]] going out of his way to upstage [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] at every diplomatic opportunity, all “in the name of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]].” Most foreign officials happily deal with the assembly instead of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]], especially those of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s closest trade partner, the [[Clovis Concord]]. The assembly ensures that such meetings are recounted to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] with embellished tales of their diplomatic success.

The acquisition of a [[Luxon beacon]] and the hunger among assembly mages to unlock its powers have drawn the animosity of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], triggering their attacks on the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].
