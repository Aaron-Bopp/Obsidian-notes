### Troka, the Scoundrel King

_Neutral good, male dragonborn_

Druvis first noticed Troka for his silver tongue, and tasked him with infiltrating the empire and appraising the situation in [[Talonstadt]]. Frustrated by the meager living conditions and demeaning treatment of his people, Troka has retaliated by sowing chaos throughout the surrounding Dwendalian territories. Troka and his troupe of slippery thieves steal from the Crown, confuse the local military, and keep a watchful eye on the [[dragonborn]] refugees, making him a folk hero among their community.
