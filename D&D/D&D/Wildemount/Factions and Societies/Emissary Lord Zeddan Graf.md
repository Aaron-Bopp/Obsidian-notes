### Emissary Lord Zeddan Graf

_Neutral good, male human_

A beloved noble and socialite from the House of Graf, Zeddan showed prowess in gathering rumors for his own entertainment. The cunning Sydnock Truscan saw promise in Zeddan’s talents and recommended him to the king to become the empire’s lead emissary. Now acting as the diplomatic contact to the world beyond the empire’s boundaries, Zeddan is eager to do the Crown’s bidding while rooting out gossip that may prove politically expedient. In his travels, Lord Zeddan often crosses paths with Lord Athesias Uludan of the Cerberus Assembly, and the pair loathe each other deeply. Zeddan is desperately trying to convince the king to install a Skyship Tower in Rexxentrum to make his travels easier.
