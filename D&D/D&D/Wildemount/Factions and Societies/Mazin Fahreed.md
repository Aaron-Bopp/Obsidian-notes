### Portcaller Mazin “Fat Fish” Fahreed

_Neutral, male tabaxi_

Tough as nails and quick to bite back, Mazin is an honorable [[tabaxi]] and dependable leader in times of trouble. This led to his rise as the Portcaller of the island village of [[Brokenbank]], the first major trade junction along the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Though the village is small, Mazin deals with a perpetual string of smugglers and pirates while also organizing the incoming and outgoing shipping lanes for much of the coast. Even so, Mazin is rarely included in major [[Clovis Concord|concord]] business, to his obvious and public frustration.
