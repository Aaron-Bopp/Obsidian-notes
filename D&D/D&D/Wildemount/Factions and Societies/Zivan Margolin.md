**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

**Allignment**:: Lawful neutral
**Gender**:: male
**Race**:: [[Humans|human]]

Zivan Margolin inherited the position of headmaster from his father, the late Jorma Margolin. Zivan has been the headmaster of the Soltryce Academy in [[Rexxentrum]] for nearly twenty years. Calm, patient, and quietly imposing, Zivan walks the halls of the Academy with a keen eye for talent. He is in charge of the curriculum and also watches for any latent powers that may be worth grooming as future allies of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]], dangers to be monitored, or prospective minds for Ikithon to conscribe into the Volstrucker. Zivan has rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate his full power, for he is typically busied with keeping the peace between the feuding members of the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]]. Those who have witnessed his true might, however, now know that his words are backed by some of the most powerful magics within the [[Cerberus Assembly]].
