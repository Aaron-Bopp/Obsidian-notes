June is seen as a studious spitfire, and she has unexpectedly proven to also be a masterful bureaucrat with a talent for exploiting legal loopholes. Driven by a youth in poverty, she swore to help repair a broken system of agricultural distribution. By making the right moves and the right friends — and making a loud fuss when necessary — she eventually became a folk hero to the underprivileged. Hoping to watch her eat her words and collapse under the pressure of imperial politics, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] offered her chief management over all agriculture in the position of Argonomist. Much to their chagrin, she’s proven both driven and capable, pushing for advanced change in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Unable to discard someone so high profile during a time of general unrest, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] instead endures her work while attempting to bury her in red tape.
