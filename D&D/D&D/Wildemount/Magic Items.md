> An undead knight bequeathes its [[Acheron blade]] to a worthy [[Tieflings|tiefling]] adventurer,  but every great treasure has its price

Since magic was first introduced to mortals in ages past, many have sought to channel the gifts of magic into implements of power. Master crafters and fine artisans have long worked with talented arcanists and divine acolytes to craft beautiful artifacts of protection, or to forge armaments of war. The most skilled archmages enchanted and assembled vast collections of mighty artifacts throughout the [[Age of Arcanum]], most of which were scattered and lost in the conflicts of [[the Calamity]].

Adventurers, archeologists, and unscrupulous explorers delve into dungeons, ruins, and forgotten places of lore in hopes of recovering these objects of power, even as spellcasters and researchers seek to replicate ancient enchantments by their own hands. This chapter contains a collection of new magic items and artifacts found in [[Wildemount]], but which can be used in any campaign setting.

Whether found in a subterranean tomb while searching for lost treasure, chosen as a reward from a wealthy collector of curiosities, or stumbled across as a discarded object of hidden potential, magic items are always highly sought after by adventurers in a [[Wildemount]] campaign. Relics of magic provide a perfect opportunity to bring alive the history of ages long gone, and to reward players for diligently seeking their way in the world.

Many of the magic items in this section are relics of the flying city-state of [[Aeor]], and can often be found in [[Aeor|Aeorian]] ruins in [[Eiselcross]].

## Vestiges of [[Divergence]]

When the great wars of [[the Calamity]] rolled across [[Exandria]], heroes of divinity accepted legendary relics from their patrons and gods. At the same time, archmages wove dangerous arcane power into items of immense magical might. When the war ended, most of these magic items were buried with their wielders beneath ash and dust. Those items that survived were passed down as heirlooms and prized tokens of the past. Whether they survived destruction or have been claimed from the ruins of history, these remnants of a lost era have come to be known as the Vestiges of [[Divergence]].

Each Vestige of [[Divergence]] is a magic item that evolves with its wielder. If not attuned to a worthy individual over a prolonged period, such items commonly revert to their **dormant state**. While in this state, a Vestige of [[Divergence]] grants an attuned bearer only some of its power. Over time, and in response to perseverance and personal growth, a Vestige of [[Divergence]] might unlock facets of its lost capabilities to enter an **awakened state**. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, these artifacts can reach their ultimate potential in their **exalted state**. The properties and features gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties and features granted at a previous state, unless otherwise noted.

This section presents a number of Vestiges of [[Divergence]] that might be found anywhere in [[Exandria]]. When Vestiges of [[Divergence]] are used in a campaign, their discovery and acquisition should always be treated with a suitable amount of weight and responsibility.

## [[Arms of the Betrayers]]

The [[Arms of the Betrayers]] are sentient weapons forged from the souls of fiends by the Betrayer Gods for their humanoid champions. These artifacts are more than just magic items. They are powerful sentient beings, filled with fury and eager to be wielded—and to spill blood.
