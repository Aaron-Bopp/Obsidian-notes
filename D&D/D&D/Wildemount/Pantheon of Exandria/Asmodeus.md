### Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells

The devil god of the Hells is the master of tyranny and domination. His words are honeyed and carefully crafted, soothing and corrupting the mortal heart. Asmodeus rules his domain with an iron fist, and the punishments awaiting those that cross him are the basis of nightmares. Evil entities pay him tribute alongside his devils, and many warlocks are drawn to his power.

Asmodeus lords over his fiendish hordes from within his fortress of Nalsheem, nestled in the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest of the Nine Hells.

**_Depiction._** A twisted image of the celestial blood that once bore him, the Lord of the Nine Hells is revealed in many tomes and murals as a handsome humanoid with deep, red skin and long, black hair. Two curling horns rise from his brow, and his lips bear an eternal, knowing grin.

**_Enemies._** Asmodeus’s enemies are numerous, even among the Betrayer Gods, many of whom only follow the archdevil for fear of his immense power. His archnemesis is [[Avandra]], whose mischief and cunning has vexed him throughout the eons. It was she who defeated him in [[the Calamity]] by tricking his fiendish armies into attacking one another. The Devil Lord’s greatest triumph during [[the Calamity]] was fooling and betraying the [[Raei|Everlight]] and slaughtering all her followers in one fell stroke—an act that has united the followers of [[Raei]] and [[Avandra]] in a bond of unbreakable fellowship ever since.

#### Commandments of Asmodeus

-   Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of the Asmodeus.
-   Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.
-   As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is for the weak.
