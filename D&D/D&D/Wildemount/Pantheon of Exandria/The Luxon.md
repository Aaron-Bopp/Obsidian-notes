### The Luxon, the First Radiance

Very few throughout [[Exandria]] have heard of the Luxon, and fewer still believe they even exist. The Luxon is the central deity of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and their way of life, but study of the Luxon beyond the borders of [[Xhorhas]] has only recently begun—and such study is mostly motivated by the [[Dwendalian Empire]]’s desire to gain an advantage in the war.

The Luxon doesn’t have an active consciousness or personality. The worship of them is largely a system of pure faith, backed by scientific and metaphysical truths that stem from the discovery of the beacons and the [[Umavi]] who interpret their meaning (see “[Kryn Dynasty](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#KrynDynasty "[[Kryn Dynasty]]")” in chapter 2). Priests of the Luxon often study [[dunamis]] and its primal arcane nature, while others are born with dunamantic gifts granted by the reality-bending powers of the beacons. Those that do call on the rarer threads of divinity use the beacons themselves as a source of magic.

**_Appearance._** By all accounts, the Luxon’s original form is believed to be a colossal, shapeless body of impossibly bright light, like a burning star. Followers of the Luxon carry small, often hollow, dodecahedrons as a symbol of their faith.
