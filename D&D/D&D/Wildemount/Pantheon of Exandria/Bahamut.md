### Bahamut, the Platinum [[Dragon]]

The pillar of justice, protection, nobility, and honor, Bahamut is a beacon to paladins of order and good, and is revered by most metallic dragons as the first of their kind. The crest of the Platinum [[Dragon]] adorns many halls of high leadership and justice, invoking his will in all matters of justice. To follow him is to look after those who cannot look after themselves.

When not wandering the [[Outer Planes]], Bahamut resides within his magnificent, glittering palace of gold, platinum, and mithril hidden among the winds of the Seven Heavens of Celestia.

**_Depiction._** The Platinum [[Dragon]] is often seen emblazoned on shields and armor, both functional and decorative, in the form of a brilliant [[dragon]] head in profile. Temples and works of art depict a massive, glittering [[dragon]] with vibrant platinum scales and seemingly endless wingspan.

**_Holy Day._** Bahamut’s holy day is called Embertide, and is celebrated on the fifth day of Duscar. This is a day of remembrance, solemnity, and respect for those who have fallen in the defense of others.
