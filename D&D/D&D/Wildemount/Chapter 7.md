Adventurers confront a fiendish [[udaak]] that haunts the edges of civilization in [[Eastern Wynandir]]

Endless turmoil has scarred [[Wildemount]], from the wars of ages long past to the more recent bloody conflicts between the many factions that lay claim to this land. These struggles have shaped the past and the future—even as they have imbued the denizens of [[Wildemount]] with the tenacity to survive in a world filled with danger.

This chapter provides [[stat blocks]] for various creatures of [[Wildemount]]. These creatures are presented in alphabetical order. For guidance on how to use a creature’s stat block, see the introduction of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual").

## Wildemount NPCs

[Appendix B](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/nonplayer-characters "Monster Manual - Appendix B") of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") contains [[stat blocks]] that can be used to represent most nonplayer characters (NPCs) in [[Wildemount]]. You can modify these [[stat blocks]] to give NPCs features similar to the [[character options]] in [chapter 4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/character-options-subclasses "[[chapter 4]]") of this book. For example, you can create an NPC dunamancer by taking the archmage or mage stat block in the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") and replacing some of its spells with new spells from [[chapter 4]], or you can take the knight or veteran stat block and add a trait similar to the Manifest Echo class feature of the [[Echo Knight]] in [[chapter 4]].

## Aeorian Hunters

Brought to life by mages in the flying city of [[Aeor]] during the [[Age of Arcanum]], [[Aeorian hunters]] were created to take on angels, demons, devils, fey, and the gods themselves. When [[Aeor]] crashed into [[Eiselcross]], many of these magically mutated monstrosities survived, and they now stalk [[Aeor]]’s ruins and the islands’ icy wastes.

**_Created by Experimentation._** [[Aeorian hunters]] were created through arcane experimentation on beasts and humanoids—both captives and volunteers. These experiments resulted in monstrosities with brightly colored flesh and the power to resist and destroy [[Aeor]]’s enemies. It is theorized that the mages of [[Aeor]] must have possessed some means of controlling their monstrous soldiers, but no such device has yet been found in the wastes of [[Eiselcross]]. [[Draconic]] was the language used by these mages to train and bind the [[Aeorian hunters]], and the hunters retain an understanding of this language even though they can’t speak it.

**_Madness through Immortality._** [[Aeorian hunters]] do not age. As such, the lust for violence their creators instilled in their minds has grown ravenous after centuries without war. Most immediately attack any creature they see.

**_Never Harm Another Hunter._** Though they crave violence, [[Aeorian hunters]] have never been seen attacking each other. Most scholars believe that [[Aeor]]’s mages must have enchanted this behavior into them, given the cost in gold and magic required to create each hunter. Some adventurers in [[Eiselcross]] boast about sneaking past [[Aeorian hunters]] using disguises or illusions to mimic a hunter’s form, but these are most likely tall tales.

**_Ageless Memories._** Each [[Aeor|Aeorian]] hunter has perfect recall of every experience since the moment of its creation. Their limited intellects and desire for violence prevent them from effectively communicating, but each hunter holds a wealth of knowledge—often including the location of rare [[Aeor|Aeorian]] relics—inside its mind.

**_Perfect Soldiers._** [[Aeorian hunters]] don’t require food or drink.

### Aeorian Absorber

Resembling some sort of canine or feline quadruped at a distance, the absorber’s monstrous nature becomes quickly apparent as it closes in. Named for its ability to draw magical energy into its body, the absorber can release that energy in devastating blasts through its tail, whose eye is constantly on the lookout for prey.

[Aeorian Absorber](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aeorian-absorber)

Large monstrosity, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 171 (18d10 + 72)

**Damage Immunities** radiant, necrotic

**Senses** [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) 120 ft., passive Perception 16

**Languages** understands [[Draconic]] but can’t speak

**Challenge** 10 (5,900 XP)

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The absorber has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

_**Pounce.**_ If the absorber moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits its claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone). If the target is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone), the absorber can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The absorber makes three attacks: one with its bite or Mind Bolt and two with its claws.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) force damage.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.

_**Mind Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 22 (4d10) psychic damage.

Reactions

_**Tail Ray.**_ When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.

### Aeorian Nullifier

Nullifiers are the [[bane]] of all magic users, with their physical forms and innate powers shaped specifically to resist and cancel magical effects. Against other foes, a nullifier is no less fearsome for the grotesque mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth that cover its torso—and which set up a cacophony of gnashing that can drive other creatures mad.

[Aeorian Nullifier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aeorian-nullifier)

Large monstrosity, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 180 (19d10 + 76)

**Speed** 40 ft.

**Saving Throws** Wis +6, Cha +8

**Skills** [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception) +6, [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival) +6

**Damage Immunities** radiant, necrotic

**Senses** [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) 120 ft., passive Perception 16

**Languages** understands [[Draconic]] but can’t speak

**Challenge** 12 (8,400 XP)

_**Horrid Gnashing.**_ The nullifier’s mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:

**1–4:** The creature is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned) until the end of the turn.

**5–6:** The creature is [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier.

**7–8:** The creature doesn’t move, and it uses its action to make one melee attack against a random creature (other than itself) if one is within reach. It otherwise does nothing.

_**Innate Spellcasting.**_ The nullifier’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: _[counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell)_ (see “Reactions” below), _[detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic)_, _[dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic)_, _[see invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/see-invisibility)_

1/day: _**[antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field)**_

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The nullifier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The nullifier makes three attacks: one with its bites and two with its claws.

_**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage, and the target is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 16) if it’s a creature. The nullifier has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

Reactions

_**Counterspell.**_ The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

### Aeorian Reverser

A reverser is a terrible foe in melee, laying into other creatures with teeth and claw. But the chaos it imposes is more fearful by far, as its enemies’ healing magic are unraveled and turned against them.

[Aeorian Reverser](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/aeorian-reverser)

Large monstrosity, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 133 (14d10 + 56)

**Speed** 40 ft., climb 40 ft.

**Saving Throws** Wis +5, Cha +2

**Skills** [Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception) +5, [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth) +6, [Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival) +5

**Damage Immunities** radiant, necrotic

**Senses** [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) 120 ft., passive Perception 15

**Languages** understands [[Draconic]] but can’t speak

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The reverser has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The reverser makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 6 (1d12) force damage.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage.

Reactions

_**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.

## Blood Hunter

To mortals and monsters alike, the [[blood hunter]] is a legendary figure—a humanoid stalker said to embrace monstrous power. Long years ago, a group of mortals undertook dark rituals and alchemical experiments to gain the power of the deadliest monsters, allowing them to better hunt those monsters.

Blood hunters are steely on the surface, but roiling emotion lies beneath that impassive mask. Bestial fury and fathomless sorrow drive every stroke of a [[blood hunter]]’s blade. Humanoids who draw the ire of a [[blood hunter]] are often in league with monsters—or the victims of a terrible misunderstanding. Such misunderstandings are tough to clear up, for blood hunters are the kind of folk to slay first and ask questions later.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

_**Blood Frenzy.**_ The [[blood hunter]] has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

## Core Spawn

The [[Elder Evils]] assault the multiverse in strange and calamitous ways. Sometimes they breach the Material Plane by exploiting the unfathomable energy and darkness found in the world’s depths. These terrestrial manifestations of loathsome alien agendas are known as [[core spawn]], and they are as varied in their physiology as they are horrific.

Their concentration in the desolate lands of [[Blightshore]] makes the [[core spawn]] a challenge to research, and many who have sought to observe or study these nightmarish entities rarely return. Those who do return are often shells of their former selves who speak of horrifying underground labyrinths of twisting caverns and malevolent nests where other denizens of the [[Miskath Strand]] are dragged below to some [[infernal]] purpose.

_**Offspring of Calamity.**_ The aberrant creatures known as [[core spawn]] are a subterranean breed of heralds, servants, foot soldiers, and lieutenants of the [[Elder Evils]], awakened in the depths by the cataclysmic actions of the Betrayer Gods and their minions. They often appear on the surface world in the wake of seismic events, such as that which created the bottomless [[Miskath Pit]] of [[Eastern Wynandir]]. Warlocks and cultists sometimes gather together to hasten the arrival of [[core spawn]] to the Material Plane, focusing their arcane power on areas of natural seismic instability when the signs and stars are right.

### Core Spawn Crawler

The smallest and most numerous of the [[core spawn]], these eyeless creatures scurry through the subterranean darkness with the help of their four irregular, gangly arms and hooked prehensile tails. [[Core spawn]] crawlers rarely travel alone, and a group of these agile predators is known as a vein of crawlers. Their clattering taloned limbs warn of their presence as they scuttle through the shadow-haunted depths of the earth.

### Core Spawn Emissary

These airborne predators serve as assassins and sentinels for the [[core spawn]]. The terrible thrum of its insectoid wings and a chittering of mandibles announces an emissary’s arrival.

The [[core spawn emissary]] can expel clouds of crystalline spores from tubes in its head. These spores act like a contact poison and can be deadly if inhaled.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

_**Crystal Spores (Recharge 6)**_ A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic crystalline spores extends out from the emissary. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned). While poisoned in this way, a creature takes 11 (2d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Core Spawn Seer

[[Core spawn]] seers are humanoid arcanists corrupted by the eldritch power of the [[Elder Evils]] through blasphemous rites or accursed encounters. Ravaged by otherworldly radiation and disease, their bodies are covered in horrible protrusions of fluorescent crystals, which emit a psychedelic glow from beneath the tattered folds of their robes.

### Core Spawn Worm

This invertebrate horror has quivering, barbed tentacles set around its massive, toothy maw. The worm’s cracked and stony hide pulses with a dull orange glow, as if it might be composed of primordial lava perpetually on the verge of hardening into solid rock.

_**Barbed Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 25 (5d6 + 8) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained). The tentacles can grapple only one creature at a time.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 30 (5d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) and [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).

## Frost Giant Zombie

An unknown [[Aeor|Aeorian]] object of immense power and mystery was uncovered and brought to the [[Fortress of the Dead Jarl]] in [[Eiselcross]] to please the ruling frost giant, Conessa Berg. The object’s unstable nature unleashed a burst of corroding arcane power, ravaging the denizens of the stronghold with twisting necromantic energies, transforming them into monstrous, rime-infused undead. These hulking brutes now wander the ruined landscape surrounding their cursed home, hunting and destroying all living things with a frightening ferocity.

The battered, butchered, and frozen remains of would-be heroes litter battle sites where these undead giants have been encountered. Underestimating these towering horrors has been the folly of numerous expeditions to the northern reaches of [[Eiselcross]], with only rumors often finding their way back as proof that these frigid monsters even exist.

_**Hearts of Ice.**_ Within the giants’ glacial hearts, glowing and unbeating, elemental energy stokes an unrivaled fury that pushes the frost giant zombies beyond the meandering speeds of standard zombies, making these behemoths far quicker than a studied mind would think a rotting giant could be.

_**Numbing Aura.**_ Beyond shaping the unsuspecting frost giants into undying horrors, the [[Aeor|Aeorian]] artifact also infused and amplified the elemental nature of the wandering horde, so that the undead giants exude a deadly aura of slowing cold, ensnaring their prey in icy mist that lessens their chance to escape.

_**Undead.**_ A [[frost giant zombie]] doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Frost Worm

Frost worms burrow through the snow, dirt, ice, and rock of [[Wildemount]]’s [[Biting North]]. These enormous monstrosities eagerly consume any living creature they can wrap their jaws around.

A [[frost worm]] spends most of its time beneath the frozen ground, conserving energy while it waits for prey to pass overhead. Smart travelers can identify a [[frost worm]]’s hunting grounds by looking for recently iced-over tunnels. When the worm senses vibrations above, it bursts forth through dirt, ice, and snow. Those who escape its initial assault must still contend with the worm’s haunting trill—a hypnotizing call that stops creatures in their tracks to make them easy prey.

[Frost Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-worm)

_**Freezing Body.**_ A creature that touches the worm or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) cold damage.

_**Death Burst.**_ When the worm dies, it explodes in a burst of frigid energy. Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures inside the worm when it dies automatically fail this saving throw.

_**Tunneler.**_ The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

Actions

_**Multiattack.**_ The worm makes two bite attacks, or uses its Trill and makes a bite attack.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) and [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and 10 (3d6) cold damage at the start of each of the worm’s turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) in a space within 10 feet of the worm.

_**Trill.**_ The [[frost worm]] emits a haunting cry. Each creature within 60 feet of the worm that can hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, or if this effect ends for it, that creature is immune to the Trill of all frost worms for the next 24 hours. Frost worms are immune to this effect.

## Gearkeeper Construct

Rolling, deadly whirlwinds of metal plates and curving blades, these clockwork automatons were initially designed by tinkerers and mage engineers to be sentries and guardians in the deepest of vaults during the [[Age of Arcanum]]. While most of these majestic and deadly curiosities have fallen to rust and ruin, forgotten along with their long-destroyed and buried societies, some continue to patrol the tunnels and pathways of forgotten tombs and dungeons, following their original operations and directives to protect the contents of their domain.

Resembling a rolling ball of shield-like plates, a [[gearkeeper construct]] can rapidly travel through corridors to seek intruders. Upon discovering an unrecognized creature, the shields expand to reveal gaps where numerous metallic legs emerge for precision movement. Bladed appendages whir around the construct, threatening any unlucky delvers who wander too close, while heavy spears of steel can be fired from within the construct’s core, impaling unwanted guests. If overwhelmed, the construct can discharge a spray of heated, jagged metal fragments to subdue groups of intruders.

Reverse engineering from the recovered shells and scraps of excavated gearkeeper constructs, a number of modern tinkerers have developed updated variations of these sentinels. Such designs are only recently seeing use in select prisons, or by wealthy collectors seeking to keep their collections safe.

_**Constructed Nature.**_ A [[gearkeeper construct]] doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Gloomstalker

A [[gloomstalker]] is a terrifying, winged predator resembling a wyvern composed of twisting shadows, with glowing eyes and dagger-like teeth.

_**Shadows of Doom.**_ Hailing from the cursed lands of the Shadowfell, these nightmarish creatures hunt the barrens of that desolate plane, freezing prey in their tracks with their woeful shrieks before pulling them into the skies with their talons to be ripped apart and devoured.

_**Night Hunters.**_ A [[gloomstalker]]’s proclivity for darkness makes it extremely dangerous at night or in heavily shaded places where it can blend in with their shadowed surroundings, but more dangerous than the lone hunter is a pack of gloomstalkers. Small packs of three to six are common. Larger packs of ten or more, called frenzies, are often harbingers of a greater evil yet to come.

_**Terror Mounts.**_ Gloomstalkers were employed by arcanists and the followers of the Betrayer Gods as mounts in the ancient battles of [[the Calamity]]. A respectable number of gloomstalkers, now free of their burden, still hold hidden lairs scattered across the [[wastes of Xhorhas]].

## Horizonback Tortoise

Desolate badlands and soggy marshes are home to the ancient and massive horizonback tortoises of [[Eastern Wynandir]]. Nearly fifty feet from nose to tail, and with a habit of remaining stationary for long periods, a [[horizonback tortoise]] is easy to mistake for a low hill at a distance. But when these impressive creatures rise to begin their march, the sight inspires fear and awe in equal parts. An omnivore of incredible size, these scavengers prefer to feed on dead vegetation, but make use of whatever edible matter they come across.

_**Friend to the [[Wastefolk]].**_ Referred to as “kinespaji” by the goblins of the east, these majestic and slow-moving beasts have long enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the denizens of [[Xhorhas]]. Horizonback tortoises provide mobile homesteads and can act as siege weapons in times of crisis.

Any creature under the tortoise when it falls prone is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the creature is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) and [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained).

While the tortoise is in its shell, its speed is 0 and can’t increase. The tortoise can emerge from its shell as an action, whereupon it is no longer prone.

## Husk Zombie

The wastes of [[Eastern Wynandir]] retain many curses and corruptions from the time of [[the Calamity]], the worst of which pervert the sanctity of death. One such curse manifests as a terrible roving fog that draws the corpses of the fallen to rise as husk zombies—resilient undead of frightening speed and bloodlust. As well, some of the more heinous fiends that walk these scarred lands feed on the life force of the living, leaving these terrible undead in their wake.

_**Psychotic Frenzy.**_ Unlike typical zombies, which are ponderous and lumbering stalkers, a [[husk zombie]] [[races]] quickly toward its prey, eager to tear flesh from bone. Each kill it makes drives it into a fighting frenzy, during which it howls with delight. It doesn’t feed on those it kills, but rather leaves the corpses to rot. Humanoids killed by a [[husk zombie]] become husk zombies themselves, rising quickly to join their slayer in merry carnage.

_**Undead.**_ A [[husk zombie]] doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

_**Multiattack.**_ The zombie makes two claw attacks. For each of these attacks that reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the zombie can make an additional claw attack.

_**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

## Merrow Shallowpriest

Some of the many merrow that dwell in the watery shadows of the [[Menagerie Coast]] learn to harness the magical aspects of the elements. Often working as guides leading merrow hunting parties, some of these shallowpriests rise to become powerful leaders, inspiring their clans to terrorize coastal communities and passing ships.

Rumors speak of underground waterways and lakes carved into the rock beneath [[Wildemount]], where shallowpriests hold court over huge subterranean communities of merrow. These evil creatures are thought to seek the means of flooding the surface world, allowing them to steal away who and what they will to the dark waters below.

While most shallowpriests do not bind themselves in the service of a specific deity, some are drawn to the worship of entities that reign over regions of the Elemental Plane of Water, hoping to find means of expanding their dominion into the seas of [[Exandria]]. These merrow often spearhead the construction of intricate shrines and temples along the bottom of the ocean, preparing a sacred space for planar doorways to their master’s realm to be opened and maintained.

## Moorbounders

One of the many predators to stalk the marshlands and muddy foothills of [[Xhorhas]], [[moorbounders]] are known as dangerous killers to those who try to avoid them on their travels—and as prized mounts for those willing to capture and train them. Though the process of domesticating a [[moorbounder]] is fraught with peril, these creatures can become favored hunting companions and powerful war mounts.

_**Natural Hunters.**_ [[Moorbounders]] hunt with elongated tusks and retractable claws. With a vague resemblance to large hunting cats, their muscular bodies are built for combat, granting them incredible prowess at leaping and a running speed that makes them dominant carnivores.

_**Bristled [[Moorbounders]].**_ A weird and deadly offshoot of the [[moorbounder]] has rows of long, bladelike bristles covering its sleek body. The creature weaponizes these blades, using them to slash nearby creatures to ribbons. However, these blades make the [[bristled moorbounder]] less suitable as a mount.

## Nergaliid (Devil Toad)

Corpulent, scaled, and utterly repulsive, these vicious devils stalk the dark edges of society away from prying eyes, subsisting on the life force of unsuspecting humanoids. Creatures that die to the nergaliid’s feeding leave a corrupted undead corpse behind known as a [[husk zombie]] (presented earlier in this chapter).

The nergaliid favors feeding on the life force of sleeping humanoids, feasting on the same prey nightly—so long as its victim remains unaware. This ensures a lasting source of nourishment, with the victim beset by terrible nightmares as long as the feeding continues. When a nergaliid is discovered, it tries to strike a deal with the one who uncovered it. It might offer material wealth in exchange for freedom and silence. Only when an accord seems unlikely does the nergaliid attack.

An [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) target fails the save automatically. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the nergaliid gains temporary hit points equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the nergaliid doesn’t gain temporary hit points. If this damage kills the target, its body rises at the end of the nergaliid’s current turn as a [husk zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/husk-zombie) (see earlier in this chapter).

## Sahuagin Warlock of Uk’otoa

The slumbering leviathan [[Uk’otoa]] preys on the fears and ambitions of humanoids that brave the depths of the Lucidian Ocean. Countless communities of sahuagin inhabit uncharted pockets of water along the [[Menagerie Coast]], and the most ambitious among them often hear the call of the leviathan in their dreams, urging them to take his power and use it to achieve their bloodsoaked dreams.

Sahuagin who answer the call of [[Uk’otoa]] tend to have one ambition in common: vengeance against the land dwellers of the [[Clovis Concord]] for daring to sail oceans that do not belong to them. As these devotees receive dark boons from their leviathan lord, other sahuagin begin to gather to their side, drawn to their displays of power and seeking their own pathway to power. Over time, these warlocks eventually become empty husks, mere receptacles for [[Uk’otoa]]’s power, and puppets that the slumbering leviathan can control as he pleases.

## Sea Fury

In times of great danger, sea hags form massive covens to channel powerful magic against outside threats. But when the threat is vanquished, these covens often destroy themselves from within. One sea hag grows more powerful than the others, killing its kin one by one and siphoning their magical power as it does so.

Driven to madness by the power it claims—and by the loneliness that is the cost of its killing spree—the hag becomes a [[sea fury]], which hoards treasure, spreads rumors, and does everything within its power to lure sailors and explorers to its lair. By doing so, it hopes to break its loneliness for a time—and then to destroy its new playthings when they have outlived their usefulness.

Legendary Actions

The [[sea fury]] can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The [[sea fury]] regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**As Water.** The [[sea fury]] transforms into a wave of foaming seawater, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying, and moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. While in this form, it can’t be [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) or [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained). It reverts to its true form at the end of this movement.

**Fearsome Apparition (Costs 2 Actions).** The [[sea fury]] conjures an apparition of one of its dead sisters, which appears in an unoccupied space the [[sea fury]] can see within 30 feet of it. Enemies of the [[sea fury]] that can see the apparition must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) of it until it vanishes at the end of the [[sea fury]]’s next turn.

**Conjure Snakes (Costs 3 Actions).** The [[sea fury]] disgorges a [swarm of poisonous snakes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes), which occupies the same space as the [[sea fury]], acts on its own initiative count, and attacks as directed by the [[sea fury]]. The [[sea fury]] can control up to three of these swarms at a time.

### A Sea Fury’s Lair

A [[sea fury]] lurks in the caverns where its coven once dwelled, decorating the walls with the bones of its slain kin, as well as baubles stolen from sunken wrecks.

A [[sea fury]] encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the [[sea fury]] can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects, but can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

-   Caverns, tunnels, and pools of water within 120 feet of the [[sea fury]] become foggy or murky, to the extent that the area becomes heavily obscured.
-   The [[sea fury]] conjures a 15-foot cube of water that fills an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it, then moves the water in a straight line up to 60 feet, after which the water disperses. Any creature that comes into contact with the rushing wave must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) by it and pushed 15 feet along its course.
-   The [[sea fury]] calls forth the spirit of a dead sailor or sea hag that met its end in the lair. This spirit has the statistics of a [specter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/specter) and lasts until the [[sea fury]] uses another lair action. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the [[sea fury]] and obeys the [[sea fury]]’s commands.

The region containing [[a sea fury’s lair]] is warped by the [[sea fury]]’s magic, which creates the following effects:

-   Sea water within 5 miles of the lair becomes coarse and choppy, as if whipped by an unseen wind.
-   Sea grass within 1 mile of the lair is imbued with a foul mockery of life, grasping ineffectually at any creature that passes within 5 feet of it.
-   Ordinary crabs and octopi within 1 mile of the lair grow in size to become [giant crabs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-crab) and [giant octopi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-octopus), respectively. These creatures serve the [[sea fury]] as spies and guards.

## Shadowghast

A [[shadowghast]] is an undead assassin. Leaping out from the shadows and trailing tendrils of darkness, it closes in on its prey with nary a sound, then tears into a victim with its paralyzing claws and furious bite.

If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Swavain Basilisk

Pearl divers and seafloor scavengers sometimes tell tales of mysterious ocean gardens filled with statues of sea creatures and sailors—the underwater grottoes of the deadly [[Swavain basilisk]]. Though named for the [[Swavain Islands]] where they are most commonly found, these dangerous hunters have been known to wander inland waterways, and have even been spotted in subterranean sewer systems.

_**Death’s Slimy Embrace.**_ Physically dissimilar to its land-based cousins, the [[Swavain basilisk]] is a thin, elongated sea serpent that commonly grows to lengths of twenty-five feet. Its sinuous body lets it move rapidly through the water and ensnare prey with equal ease. Unlike the deadly gaze of its land-based cousin, the [[Swavain basilisk]] secretes a thick oil that can turn other creatures to stone. Petrified prey sinks to the ocean floor, where the basilisk feeds at its leisure, the devoured bits returning to flesh once consumed. If processed properly under the supervision of an experienced alchemist, the basilisk’s oil can be used to reverse the petrification effects it causes.

_**Shipwreck Steward.**_ Swavain basilisks occasionally hunt ashore under cover of night, but are more often drawn to hunt and nest near the sites of shipwrecks. When salvage parties and treasure hunters seek out those wrecks for profit, the [[Swavain basilisk]] adds more drowned stone to its collection.

Unless the save succeeds, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained), and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Petrified).

## Udaak

Known commonly as the brutes of [[Xhorhas]], these enormous creatures resemble an immense, demonic cross between ox and gorilla. Udaaks are solitary wanderers, found most commonly along the edges of settled lands in the barrens of [[Eastern Wynandir]]. Though they often scavenge for food, a hungry [[udaak]] will attack almost any prey, its four sets of red eyes and its tangle of teeth and tusks striking fear into the heart of any creature.

_**Living Siege Engine.**_ Originally brought to [[Exandria]] from the Abyss, udaaks lost their connection to that realm after the [[Divergence]] and have roamed the world freely ever since. In recent years, the warmasters of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] have developed arcane collars that can keep an [[udaak]] under control, and they have begun using these dread creatures in the war against the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

_**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

_**Swallow.**_ The [[udaak]] makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends.

If the [[udaak]] takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the [[udaak]] must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) in a space within 10 feet of the [[udaak]]. If the [[udaak]] dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).
