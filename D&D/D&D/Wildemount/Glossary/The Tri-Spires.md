#### The Tri-Spires
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley/Zadash
**Location**:: [[Zadash]]

 The Tri-Spires are known throughout the walls of [[Zadash]] as the neighborhood of the noble elite and the wealthy. Built on the ruins of the old Pious District after the fall of the [[Julous Dominion]], the Tri-Spires now stand as the center of aristocracy and higher learning within the city â€” and, indeed, throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], second only to [[Rexxentrum]]. The region takes its name from the three large, uniquely constructed towers that lord over the skyline: the Zauberspire, the Constellation Bridge, and the Triumph Chime. The Zauberspire is the central tower of the Halls of Erudition, a beautiful ivory campus that is an extension of the Soltryce Academy. The Constellation Bridge looms over the Gilded Willows neighborhood as an extremely tall, thin watchtower that offers an incredible view of the entire city and the [[Marrow Valley]] beyond. Once a temple to [[Avandra]], The Triumph Chime is now a squat, seven-story belfry outfitted with sleeping chambers, bars, and a raucous gambling hall.
