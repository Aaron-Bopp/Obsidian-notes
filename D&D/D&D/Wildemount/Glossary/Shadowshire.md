#### Shadowshire
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas/Rosohna
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Several well-guarded stairways curl beneath the Firmaments, descending under the surface of [[Xhorhas]] into the Shadowshire, a vast subterranean district built throughout the reclaimed prisons of [[Torog]]. Less affluent [[Dark Elves]] live among the stone and glass abodes built into the rock and sediment. Caverns amass bioluminescent fungi to be harvested for food and medicine, while enchanted lanterns light the various levels with a soft and many-colored luminescence. A magical underground farmland has been established here, where sunless crops are grown to feed the city. The second entrance of the Dungeon of Penance is located within the Shadowshire.
