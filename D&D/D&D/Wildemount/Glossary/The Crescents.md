**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast/Port Damali
**Location**:: [[Port Damali]]

 The ward known as the Crescents was named in reference to the seven large, moon-shaped statues that were a gift from the Alkamar family when the city was founded. This affluent area houses competing guild families and well-connected nobles who wish to live near the politics of the city or the delights of the port. The beautiful Pearl Shrine temple to [[Avandra]] and the Sunfall Sanctuary temple to [[Pelor]] reside within the Crescents.
