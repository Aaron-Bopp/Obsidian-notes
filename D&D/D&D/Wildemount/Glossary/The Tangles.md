#### The Tangles
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields/Rexxentrum
**Location**:: [[Rexxentrum]]

 This western region of Rexxentrum houses the working class folk of the city. It is here that most of the city's general commerce takes place. Dozens of smaller streets branch off major roads to create a labyrinth of twisting neighborhoods and industrial districts. The network of major roads converges to form three major plazas across the district, where shops, inns, and various forms of entertainment can be found. The Platinum Veranda plaza lies at the northern end of the Tangles, where the more expensive homes and luxurious entertainment can be found, as well as the central temple to [[Bahamut]], called the Dragon Seat.
