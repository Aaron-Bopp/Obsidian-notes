#### Firmaments
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas/Rosohna
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Near the center of Rosohna, travelers will find the Firmaments, where the haunted memory of Ghor Dranas has been erased with a beautiful district of glowing drow gardens, luxurious chapels to [[the Luxon]], and the spacious halls of Marble Tomes Conservatory, the city's center of higher learning. Wealthy estates house Den members and figures of import to the dynasty, and the impressive towers of the Nimbus Keep loom over the region. The Nimbus Keep is the center of the [[Aurora Watch]] and the first of two paths to the Dungeon of Penance beneath the city.
