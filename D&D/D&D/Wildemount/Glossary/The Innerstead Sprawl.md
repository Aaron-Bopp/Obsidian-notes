#### The Innerstead Sprawl
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley/Zadash
**Location**:: [[Zadash]]

 A labyrinth of houses owned by the working-class people of Zadash, the Sprawl bends between the other districts, acting as the boundary between them. Except for a few of the temples, such as the Valley Archive of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]], the Platinum House, and the King's Hall, much of the architecture is simple and built for function.
