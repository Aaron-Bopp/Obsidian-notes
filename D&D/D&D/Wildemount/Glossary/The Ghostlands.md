#### The Ghostlands
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas/Rosohna
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Large sections of the foreboding obsidian walls that once surrounded the city have fallen, but they are in the process of being rebuilt as the war with the empire grows more violent. Within these walls, the outlying Ghostlands remain empty, haunted by ghosts and shadows, the razed structures and barracks of the larger, ancient city left to crumble to dust. Two functional roads known as the Hallowed Paths allow caravans, travelers, and military forces to reach the city.
