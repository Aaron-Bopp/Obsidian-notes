 Standing vigilant in the center of the inner walls is the [[Castle Ungebroch]] Terrace, a small district of compact military outposts that surround [[Castle Ungebroch]]. The dark stone of the castle splits into numerous towers, while high-arched stained glass windows dress the exterior of each floor of the citadel. Within the shadowy halls of the castle, lit by flickering torchlight, the king rules with his family and councilors at his beck and call.
