[[Dunamis]] is the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. Manifesting as a translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, [[dunamis]] darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.

Dunamancy is an ancient, esoteric study of magic almost unknown across [[Exandria]]. Facets of dunamancy have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves dunamancers, and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.

### Beyond the [[Kryn Dynasty]]

Although the [[Kryn Dynasty]] is responsible for the carefully guarded development and refining of dunamancy, the mysteries of this magical art have long since spread beyond the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]’s borders. The hidden secrets of harnessing [[dunamis]] eventually found their way into the hands of the [[Cerberus Assembly]] and have continued to slowly disseminate across all [[Wildemount]] as a result.

If you are considering a character pursuing a path involving the manipulation of [[dunamis]], you can easily tie your story into the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the ready access to dunamancy it provides. But you can also consider where else in the world dunamancy might have spread, and how its secrets have influenced your character’s path. You might have stumbled into a cabal of defecting [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] expatriates who teach you their ways, or you might have been entrusted with learning such secrets as a means of fighting the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] with their own power. Work with your Dungeon Master and figure out a fun and logical way that your character and the mysterious power of dunamancy might have crossed paths.

In campaigns outside [[Wildemount]], there is no factional control of dunamancy, so the implementation of this arcane discipline is entirely open. Talk to your Dungeon Master about how dunamancy might fit into their campaign, and how your character’s story could be woven into that lore.
