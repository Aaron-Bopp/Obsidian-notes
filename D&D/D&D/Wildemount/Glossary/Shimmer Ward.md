#### Shimmer Ward
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields/Rexxentrum
**Location**:: [[Rexxentrum]]

 Within the inner walls of the city, the Shimmer Ward is where the noble houses and guild leaders of [[Rexxentrum]] dwell. Here, beautiful gardens and museums celebrate Zemnian culture, and specialist merchants promote their unique wares. The debate forum is rarely used aside from holidays, where intellectuals will challenge each other to arguments about philosophy and history. Cottages and tasteful estates sit behind tall fences and walls, and a pair of open squares host occasional galas when the local elite are in need of socialization.
