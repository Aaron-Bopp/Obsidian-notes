 East of the castle stands the collection of eight tall spires that house the members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Each tower has its own unique appearance. The original Candles were built to the specifications of the original leading members of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. In the years since, each tower has been magically altered to the taste of their successors. This creates a jagged and subtly unsettling sight visible from any point in the city.
