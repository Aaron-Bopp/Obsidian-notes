#### Lucid Bastion
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas/Rosohna
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Located at the very center of Rosohna is the awe-inspiring and towering citadel of the Lucid Bastion. This impressive cathedral is built from the ruins of Virkwzual and now stands as the symbol of Kryn rebirth and their faith in the light of [[the Luxon]]. The Lucid Bastion's spires of gray quartz pierce the sky, and the soft interior glow that suffuses the interior chambers never darkens, shining over the city day and night. Major religious events are centered around the Bastion, for it houses the "heart of consecution," the first [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) to have been discovered. Within these halls, the Bright Queen, her trusted [[Umavi]], and their Dens work to govern and protect all citizens of the [[Kryn Dynasty]].
