**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Most of the city's poorer citizens are scattered throughout this sprawling, foggy district of salvaged structures and newer homesteads. Patches of magically maintained farmland are tilled and tended by nearby denizens, while industrial factories and bellows release stacks of black smoke and faintly colored steam. [[Aurora Watch]] captains coordinate law enforcement from three fortresses, while mercenaries, volunteers, and desperate folk often strike out into [[the Ghostlands]] with hopes of exorcising new neighborhoods to shelter the continuously growing population of [[Rosohna]].
