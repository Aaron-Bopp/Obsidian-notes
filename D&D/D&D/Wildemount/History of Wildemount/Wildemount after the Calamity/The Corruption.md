### The Corruption

It is still unclear what triggered the event. Whether some knowledge-hungry researcher or arrogant sorcerer was delving in forgotten vaults between the planes, or some terrible power lying dormant beneath the forest was awakened, the source of the corruption is unknown. What is known is that in the year 585 PD, suddenly and without warning, a wave of purple-gray shadow rapidly crept from the center of [[Molaesmyr]] to engulf the entire city.

Many elves choked and died on toxic fumes, while others were twisted and driven mad, transforming into terrifying fey abominations. Trees bent and warped, leaves withered and turned a sickly purple, and strange, unknown bramble growths reclaimed the forest floor. This corruption slowly spread throughout the entire Veluthil Forest, decimating the home of the elves. Some survivors fled as fast as they could to the northwest, across the Frigid Depths, eventually settling the township of [[Bysaes Tyl]] in the Pearlbow Wilderness. Others escaped to the northeast, seeking refuge in the [[Flotket Alps]], freezing in the snowy mountains until they stumbled on the dwarves of [[Uthodurn]].

Taking pity on the survivors, the dwarves took in the elven refugees and offered them a home. This act of kindness changed the course of [[Uthodurn]]’s history, eventually forming a unique union of dwarven and elven culture that has endured for nearly three centuries. Craftsmanship within Uthodurn is second to none, but nothing is traded beyond the borders of the city, aside from the odd stolen artifact. Small excavation parties are often sent to the corrupted Veluthil Forest—now called the [[Savalirwood]]—to search the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]], attempting to piece together what caused the corruption and determine if the forest can be recovered.

Unfortunately, a township of criminals and outlaws has sprung up on the southern edge of the [[Savalirwood]], just beyond the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. In addition to the dangerous denizens of this wretched thicket, which is known as [[Shadycreek Run]], there are numerous raiders and thieves seeking relics from the ruins of the forest, escalating conflict throughout the region.
