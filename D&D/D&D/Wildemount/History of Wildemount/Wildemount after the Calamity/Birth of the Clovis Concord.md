### Birth of the [[Clovis Concord]]

At this time, the city of Ank’Harel in [[Marquet]] had just named the mysterious J’mon Sa Ord as their new emperor. In the transition, the Marquesian colonists now living along the coast demanded independence from [[Marquet]] to begin building their own society and identity alongside [[Ki’Nau]]. Ord eventually accepted the request, and the emancipated Marquesians allied themselves with the [[Ki’Nau]] to build a new civilization. Over the following centuries, numerous port towns sprung up and grew into city states, trade routes expanded along what is now known as the [[Menagerie Coast]], and the emerging guilds consolidated enough power to become the region’s ruling class: the [[Clovis Concord]].

The concord works together to keep the surrounding Lucidian Ocean under their watch and rule, setting trade laws and guiding the fortunes of those who sail on the open waters. The blend of cultures that forms the [[Menagerie Coast]] creates a diverse community where the arts are lauded and coin is king. However, the shadow of [[the Myriad]] syndicate continues to infiltrate the streets, while the pirate alliance known as [[the Revelry]] has risen to harry the trade routes and rebel against the concord. Tensions are further escalated by the threat of expanding war to the northeast between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Kryn Dynasty]].
