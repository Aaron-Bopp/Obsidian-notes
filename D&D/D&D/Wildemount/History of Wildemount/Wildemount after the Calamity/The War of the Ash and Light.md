## The War of the Ash and Light
**Tag**:: #Exandria/History
**Location**:: [[History of Wildemount]]

In the past century, the [[Dwendalian Empire]] has clashed with the [[Kryn Dynasty]]. Small skirmishes and slain soldiers on both sides deter expansion beyond the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], with each faction keeping a close eye on the other.

Recently, the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s interest in growing [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] influence has led to increasing curiosity about the source of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]]’s mysterious arcane capabilities. [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] spies successfully stole two of four artifacts known as “beacons,” which seemed to be powerful sources of the unique magical energy called [[Dunamancy|dunamis]]. The Bright Queen [[Leylas Kryn]] began an initiative steal back the beacons and assault [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] strongholds until these sacred relics are returned. Now, in 835 PD, the resulting skirmishes have escalated into all-out war. A fifth beacon has been recently uncovered by the [[Cerberus Assembly]], and the violence threatens to grow past the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] and embroil other denizens of [[Wildemount]] in the conflict.
