### The Chroma Conclave

In the year 815 PD, an unexpected assault on [[Draconia]] came in the form of a group of ancient chromatic dragons calling themselves the Chroma Conclave. The mighty city of Draconia was immediately destroyed and left to crumble in the [[Dreemoth Ravine]]. A powerful white dragon called Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, claimed the ravine as its new domain, while the rest of the dragons sought conquest elsewhere in Exandria. These events shook the nations of [[Wildemount]], sending the [[Clovis Concord]] and the [[Dwendalian Empire]] into a state of alert, while the [[Kryn Dynasty]] temporarily withdrew to Rosohna, fearing another attack.

As time passed, Vorugal and the entire Chroma Conclave were slain and the danger seemed to have dissipated. With [[Draconia]] sundered, the no-longer enslaved ravenites greatly outnumbered their previous masters; they claimed their freedom and punished the surviving draconbloods. A handful of draconian nobles fled to the [[Menagerie Coast]] or the [[Dwendalian Empire]] to seek asylum, leaving the ravenites to rebuild [[Wildemount]] dragonborn society on the ruins of their oppressors.
