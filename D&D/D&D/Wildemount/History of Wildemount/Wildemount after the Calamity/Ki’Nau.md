### The Ki’Nau

The few scattered survivors of the floods found shelter among the higher jungles of the [[Swavain Islands]], gifted with the bounty of a more plentiful and tropical environment. These seafaring people rebuilt among the islands and took the name Ki’Nau, meaning “the Water Children” in their language of Naush. Though the terrible floods of [[the Calamity]] had passed, the deadly seas and flourishing horrors of the wilds were still a persistent threat to the Ki’Nau. Each generation struggled to survive the elements that sunk their boats and the predators of the jungles and ocean depths.

Over time, an older mind began to call from the waters and entered their dreams. This powerful being, a leviathan creation abandoned by his creator [[Zehir]] in the [[Divergence]], called himself [[Uk’otoa]]. He spoke of his divinity and promised protection to the Ki’Nau people in exchange for their worship. The Ki’Nau accepted the persuasive entity as an ally and protector, allowing [[Uk’otoa]] to rise up as the guardian of the islands and help the Ki’Nau become a proud society of warriors, establishing dominance over the region for centuries.
