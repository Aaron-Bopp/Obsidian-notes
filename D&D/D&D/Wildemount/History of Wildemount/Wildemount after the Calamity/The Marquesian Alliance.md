### The Marquesian Alliance

Around the year 400 PD, an exploration vessel from the distant land of [[Marquet]] was nearing the end of its provisions when it reached the [[Swavain Islands]]. Discovered and captured by the ever-watchful [[Ki’Nau]], the desperate explorers made trade offerings of foreign gold, spices, and fine silks. This diplomatic approach won over the leaders of [[Ki’Nau]], and an alliance was made with the Marquesian travelers to return with trade goods and establish a Marquesian outpost, which was to be named Damali.

During this time, a cruel seafaring culture called the Vukan discovered [[Ki’Nau]] and coveted their lush homesteads and rich, sea-gathered jewelry. These Vukan began a series of coordinated assaults on the [[Ki’Nau]], killing and kidnapping a number of them under the shadow of night. The Marquesian guilds who had sent the exploration ship agreed to offer naval support to combat these attacks, but it was [[Uk’otoa]] whose fury ultimately annihilated the Vukan at their home villages and erased them from [[Exandria]].

Having lost a portion of their fleet in these fights, the surviving Marquesian naval ships remained to build small settlements along the coast to aid in their trade with [[Ki’Nau]]. The [[Ki’Nau]] leader Tauan kept a tentative peace with the foreign sailors, but [[Uk’otoa]] wanted to dominate the new arrivals who refused to renounce their old gods and bow to him. These tensions came to a head when a secret sect of Marquesian worshipers of the Cloaked Serpent [[Zehir]] were given a task by their enraged god from beyond the [[Divine Gate]]: to destroy [[Uk’otoa]] for his insolence. With the aid of a powerful cult leader within an archeological guild known as the Allegiance of Allsight, a series of temples built to [[Uk’otoa]] were corrupted with [[Zehir]]’s influence and used to seal [[Uk’otoa]] deep beneath the rock of the ocean floor, robbing the [[Ki’Nau]] of their patron.
