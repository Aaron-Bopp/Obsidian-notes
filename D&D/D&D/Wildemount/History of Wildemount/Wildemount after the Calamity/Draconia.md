### Draconia

After [[the Calamity]], a shard of the destroyed dragonkin city of Kethesk came to rest within the southern [[Dreemoth Ravine]]. The surviving [[dragonborn]] took advantage of the ravine’s defensible layout to build a new city and made an alliance with the cave-dwelling, indigenous [[dragonborn]] they called ravenites, beginning the reformation of civilized [[dragonborn]] society.

With the ravenites as a labor force, the [[dragonborn]] harvested the massive brumestone crystals that had once held their city aloft, and the new city of Draconia began to take shape as a series of floating islands within the heart of the chasm. Calling themselves [[Dragonborn|draconbloods]], they spent hundreds of years slowly reconstructing their nation in seclusion, focusing entirely on their own enlightenment and pursuits. They eventually enslaved the ravenites to mine the ravine’s gold and gemstones, and to ensure [[Dragonborn|draconblood]] dominance in the region, leaving their minds free to focus on internal politics and arcane advancement.
