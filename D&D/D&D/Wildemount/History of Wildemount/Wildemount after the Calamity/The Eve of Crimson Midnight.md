### The Eve of Crimson Midnight

Not a quarter century after [[the Marrow War]] ended and the line of kings was established, a smaller, internal conflict rocked the capital city of [[Rexxentrum]]. A number of noble houses with a strong history of studying arcane pursuits began to compete with other high-born magic practitioners from the Julous Dominion. Throughout the lands of the newly expanded empire, these houses escalated their subterfuge and espionage against one another, until the rivalry finally erupted into an all-out magical conflict in the streets of the capital itself.

The events of the Eve of Crimson Midnight destroyed numerous buildings and maimed a number of innocents caught in the crossfire. The struggle ended with all involved shackled and brought before the king. After days of deliberation, an agreement was drawn up that would absolve those involved of the usual punishment in exchange for direct subservience to the Crown and the goals of the empire. Establishing themselves as the [[Cerberus Assembly]], this council of mages became a powerful tool for the empire to maintain its position as the dominant force of [[Wildemount]].
