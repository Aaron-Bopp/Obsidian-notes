## The Eve of Crimson Midnight

**Location**:: [[History of Wildemount]]

Not a quarter century after [[the Marrow War]] ended and the line of kings was established, a smaller, internal conflict rocked the capital city of [[Rexxentrum]]. A number of noble houses with a strong history of studying arcane pursuits began to compete with other high-born magic practitioners from the [[Julous Dominion]]. Throughout the lands of the newly expanded [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], these houses escalated their subterfuge and espionage against one another, until the rivalry finally erupted into an all-out magical conflict in the streets of the capital itself.

The events of the Eve of Crimson Midnight destroyed numerous buildings and maimed a number of innocents caught in the crossfire. The struggle ended with all involved shackled and brought before [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. After days of deliberation, an agreement was drawn up that would absolve those involved of the usual punishment in exchange for direct subservience to [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] and the goals of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. Establishing themselves as the [[Cerberus Assembly]], this council of mages became a powerful tool for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to maintain its position as the dominant force of [[Wildemount]].
