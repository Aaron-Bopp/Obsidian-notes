#### Shadow Essence (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Ghor Veles]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 The characters are hired by [[Cerberus Assembly]] sages in [[New Haxon]] to gather a rare magical ingredient—shadow essence—that can be collected from dead [gloomstalkers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/[[gloomstalker]]) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#[[Gloomstalker]] "chapter 7")). As gloomstalkers are known to circle above Ghor Veles like vultures, the sages ask the characters to travel there, slay a [[gloomstalker]], and collect its shadow essence in a specially made flask. The sages warn the characters not to linger near Ghor Veles, lest they fall prey to the terrible creatures lurking in its haunted fortress.
