#### Eater of Worlds (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[New Haxon]]
**Level**:: High Level

 The characters are summoned to a meeting with Satyana Vorvexis. One of the [[dragon]]'s spies managed to infiltrate a cult operating within the city and determined that its leaders are preparing a ritual to summon Shothotugg, the Eater of Worlds (see the "[Elder Evils of Exandria](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary/#sidebarElderEvilsOfExandria "[[Elder Evils]] of [[Exandria]]")" sidebar in chapter 7). Shothotugg's arrival would almost certainly place [[New Haxon]] in jeopardy. The cult controls a crumbling dungeon complex below the ruins of Old Haxon. The cult's leaders are a pair of [vampires](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) aided by a small conclave of [cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cloaker), but most of the cult members are nihilistic humanoids and [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn).
