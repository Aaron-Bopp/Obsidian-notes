#### Eater of Worlds (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[New Haxon]]
**Level**:: High Level

 The characters are summoned to a meeting with Satyana Vorvexis. One of the [[dragon]]'s spies managed to infiltrate a [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] operating within the city and determined that its leaders are preparing a ritual to summon Shothotugg, the Eater of Worlds (see the "[Elder Evils of Exandria](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary/#sidebarElderEvilsOfExandria "[[Elder Evils]] of [[Exandria]]")" sidebar in [[chapter 7]]). Shothotugg's arrival would almost certainly place [[New Haxon]] in jeopardy. The [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] controls a crumbling dungeon complex below the ruins of Old Haxon. The [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]]'s leaders are a pair of [vampires](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) aided by a small conclave of [cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cloaker), but most of the [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] members are nihilistic humanoids and [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn).
