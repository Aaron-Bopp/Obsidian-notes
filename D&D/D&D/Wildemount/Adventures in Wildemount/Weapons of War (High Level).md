**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Aeor Crash Site]]
**Level**:: High Level

 The characters are hired by a representative of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the [[Kryn Dynasty]], [[The Myriad]], or some other faction to travel to the [[Aeor Crash Site]] and search for gold vials containing [[frigid woe]], a milky liquid. A previous expedition found one such vial, and the characters' benefactors want more of it. The party's benefactor wants to keep the vials from falling into the wrong hands or wants to sell them to the highest bidder. To reach a hidden cache of vials in the depths of the crash site, the characters must content with [[Aeorian hunters]] (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#AeorianHunters "[[chapter 7]]")) and a rival search party of high-level adventurers.
