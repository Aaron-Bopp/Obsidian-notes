 An entire team of explorers was torn apart in the wastes just outside Balenpost. The tracks nearby indicate that only humanoids were involved in the struggle. Agents of the Dwendalian royal family send the characters to investigate, suspecting that one of the other teams ambushed the victims. Wardlow Akron is loath to cooperate with the characters since they are sent by the empire, and because he knows the responsibility for the attacks lies partly on his shoulders. The person behind the attacks is Mera Vacross, a female human transformed into a [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) by one of Korberta Horswell's experiments. The vampire escaped the lab and makes her home in a cave just outside Balenpost. If the characters take care of the vampire, Wardlow tries to bribe or threaten the characters to keep quiet about the monster's origins.
