**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Fortress of the Dead Jarl]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 When the characters arrive in [[Balenpost]] or [[Syrinlya]], a [frost giant zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-giant-zombie) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#FrostGiantZombie "chapter 7")) attacks the camp. If the characters help defeat the giant, the leader of the camp tells the characters it is the third attack in as many days and asks them to find the source of the zombies. Characters can track the zombies back to the fortress. Each day the characters follow this path, roll any die. On an even result, the characters encounter 1d4 frost giant zombies. When they reach the fortress, they find that one of the walls is breached and must repair it to stop the zombies from leaving the castle. This breach could be natural or could be caused by a faction with a score to settle against the attacked outpost.
