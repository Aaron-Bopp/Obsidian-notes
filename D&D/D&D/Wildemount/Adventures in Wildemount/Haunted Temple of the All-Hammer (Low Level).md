#### Haunted Temple of the [[Moradin|All-Hammer]] (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Uraliss]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] avoid [[Uraliss]]'s temple of [[Moradin]] at all costs. The temple is filled with specters of [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] captured by a high priest who went mad and locked her congregation in the temple during the final [[Orcs|orc]] raid. All her victims starved to death, as did the priest herself, who became a [wraith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/wraith). The characters could come to this building to find a lost treasure of [[Moradin]], or to escape other threats as they pass through the ruined town.
