#### Log Wars (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Tussoa]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 A business war turns physical when a camp of Regver loggers is murdered and evidence points to a nearby camp of Majest loggers as culprits. Regver responds by burning Majest vessels, and the violence continues to escalate. The marquis fears that the war might spill into Tussoa's streets, so she hires the characters to negotiate a peace. They might find that [[the Revelry]] committed the inciting murders as a way to cause chaos in the city.
