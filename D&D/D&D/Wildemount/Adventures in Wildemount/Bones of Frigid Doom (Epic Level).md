**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Dreemoth Ravine]]
**Level**:: Epic Level

 A [death knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-knight) named Pentrakath lurks in a cave in the Dreemoth Ravine, and he has uncovered the bones of Vorugal, the [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-dragon) that destroyed [[Draconia]] twenty years ago. He gathered a host of profane relics and stole the souls of hundreds of dead [[dragonborn]] in an attempt to stitch together a soul powerful enough to resurrect Vorugal as an ancient white dracolich (see [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")).
