**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Igrathad]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 An exiled Dolorav necromancer has allied himself with a clan of bloodthirsty [minotaurs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/minotaur) to manufacture an army of undead, whose slow expansion poses a threat to [[Igrathad]]. Each of [[Igrathad]]'s seven villages appoints a champion to march with Dolorav and Koshtask warriors against this cruel usurper and his legion of unholy monstrosities. The characters must join the fight if they want the villages to help them with some other matter.
