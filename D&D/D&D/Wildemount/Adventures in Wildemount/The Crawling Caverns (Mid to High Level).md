**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Dunrock Mountains]]
**Level**:: Mid to High Level

 Hidden deep in the heart of the Dunrocks are the forgotten depths of the Bastille of Torment, a massive, multilevel dungeon where [[Torog]] tortured the enemies of the Betrayer Gods during the [[Age of Arcanum]]. This horrifying abandoned prison is now run by a cabal of [spirit nagas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spirit-naga), who guard the many arcane secrets and treasures left by the Betrayers.
