#### Awful Wails (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Uthodurn]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters are hired by the Glassblades to investigate a series of murders. Ancient [[elves]], old enough to remember the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]], are withering and dying in the streets at night. Witnesses all report hearing the same thing before finding the bodies: a horrible wail. The culprit is Myra Quirn, an [[Elves|elf]] who was turned into a [banshee](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/banshee) when she was left behind as her people fled [[Molaesmyr]], and turned into a vengeful spirit by the dark magic of the ruins. After many years of searching, Myra found her still-living kin in Uthodurn, and she plans to exact revenge on every last [[Elves|elf]] that left her behind.
