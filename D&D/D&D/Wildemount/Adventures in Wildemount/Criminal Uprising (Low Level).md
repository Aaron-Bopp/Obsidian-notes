#### Criminal Uprising (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Port Zoon]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 While the characters visit Port Zoon, captured [bandits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit) forced to work for the guilds break out of their bonds, overpower their captors, and free other brigands working in the city. These criminals take control of vital industries in Port Zoon, threatening to destroy industrial sites unless given their freedom. The characters are hired to quell the uprising. Who is behind this revolt? Maybe the criminals planned it themselvesâ€”or perhaps an outside organization engineered it for their own purposes.
