**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Savalirwood]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The Nightback Clan captured a merchant caravan traveling through the [[Savalirwood]], suspecting that the travelers are thieves. The characters are hired by the merchant's family to rescue the caravan. If they can track the [[tabaxi]] through the woods, they must either convince the Nightback Clan that the travelers are innocent or fight to free the captives. Things grow more complicated when the [[tabaxi]] present compelling evidence that this merchant caravan is more than just a group of simple travelers.
