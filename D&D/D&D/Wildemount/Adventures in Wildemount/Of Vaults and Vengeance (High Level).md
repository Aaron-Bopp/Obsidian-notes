#### Of Vaults and Vengeance (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Ghor Veles]]
**Level**:: High Level

 One or more of the characters are kidnapped by minions of [Oracs the Enduring](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oracs-the-enduring) (chaotic evil, male, ancient black dracolich) and are carried away to the vaults below Ghor Veles for indoctrination and necromantic experimentation. With the help of a [core spawn seer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/core-spawn-seer) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#CoreSpawnSeer "chapter 7")) from the [[Miskath Pit]], the dracolich and his minions are weaponizing their mortal enemies to gruesome effect. As one half of the party struggles to survive captivity, the rest of the characters must plot their harrowing rescue.
