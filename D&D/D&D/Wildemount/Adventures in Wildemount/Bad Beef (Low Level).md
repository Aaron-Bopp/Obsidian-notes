#### Bad Beef (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Blumenthal]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 Tainted beef from three different cattle farms in Blumenthal has killed several people in [[Rexxentrum]]. [[Crownsguard]] investigators concluded that the meat was intentionally poisoned and hire the characters to find the culprits. Why hire outsiders? The [[Crownsguard]] in Blumenthal is on the list of suspects, since they escorted the meat to [[Rexxentrum]]. Of course, the list of suspects doesn't stop there. Did the farmers work together because they abhor living under imperial rule? Is there an agent of the Kryn within Blumenthal? Is someone using enchantment magic from afar to make farmhands poison beef? One thing is for sure: the culprits are willing to kill and won't come quietly.
