#### Yeenoghu's Army (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Alfield]]
**Level**:: High Level

 While the characters are staying in Alfield, they learn the truth of the recent [gnoll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gnoll) attack. The first battle was just a way to test the town's defenses for the real war: one fought by demons! The [[gnolls]] sacrificed the townsfolk captured during their raid to open a portal to the Abyss, letting demons loyal to Yeenoghu, the Gnoll Lord, invade the Material Plane. With so few defenses in the settlement, the characters are the only people who can truly defend Alfield from the threat.
