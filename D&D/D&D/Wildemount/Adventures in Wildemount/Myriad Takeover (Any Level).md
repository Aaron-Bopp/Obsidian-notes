**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Alfield]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 Overworked leadership and weak law enforcement mean that [[Alfield]] is ripe for [[The Myriad|Myriad]] takeover. The characters could be hired to lead [[the Myriad]] forces, bringing the town's leadership and petty criminals to heel, or they could fight against the takeover, waging battles both physical and political to keep the town out of the syndicate's grasp.
