**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Vol'antim]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters are asked by the [aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/[[aarakocra]]) of Vol'antim to help destroy a nest of gorefeather [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/harpy). During the quest, the characters uncover a clutch of harpy eggs, which the [[aarakocra]] believe should be destroyed, since legends say that each generation of harpies is stronger than the last. If the characters destroy the eggs, they will drive the harpies to greater acts of destruction. But they refuse, how might the [[aarakocra]] react?
