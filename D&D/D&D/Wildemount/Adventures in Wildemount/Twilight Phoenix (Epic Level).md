#### Twilight Phoenix (Epic Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Kamordah]]
**Level**:: Epic Level

 The truth of [[Kamordah]]'s geothermal activity is far more sinister and fantastical than many know. The ancient and mad twilight phoenix [[Desirat]] (see [chapter 1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-[[wildemount]]#DesirattheTwilightPhoenix "[[chapter 1]]")) is chained beneath [[Mount Mentiri]]. A cabal of [archmages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage) who worship [[Asmodeus]] seek to free the Lord of the Nine Hells' steed, secretly gathering components for a ritual to sunder the mountain and unleash the crazed entity to incinerate the countryside. If the characters cannot stop the ritual, they must combat the twisted, primal phoenix herself.
