 Regin Kavla (lawful evil, female, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)), a former spy for [[The Myriad]], is trapped in the bowels of the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]]. Worried that she might share important secrets, [[The Myriad]] hires the characters to get into the prison, capture Regin, and delivered her to them, offering a hefty sum or some other reward â€” whatever it takes to get the job done.
