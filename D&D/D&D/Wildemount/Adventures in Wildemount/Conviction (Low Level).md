 Nathrow Arple (neutral evil, male, stout [[Halflings|halfling]] [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)), a former enforcer for [[the Myriad]], came to [[Balenpost]] with his old crew of four [thugs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thug). The group was captured fifteen years ago during the raid on [[the Myriad]]'s central facility in [[Yrrosa]]. Nathrow got his imprisoned crew on the same exploration team, then they murdered their [[Cerberus Assembly]] leader and made off into the wilds of [[Eiselcross]], looking to steal a fishing vessel. Wardlow Akron offers the characters 100 gp to hunt down the criminals and throws in a [gem of brightness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/gem-of-brightness) if the characters bring back Nathrow alive (so the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] can make an example of him). If the characters brave the dangers of [[Eiselcross]] and catch up to the criminals, Nathrow offers them anything within his power to avoid arrest and turns to combat if all else fails.
