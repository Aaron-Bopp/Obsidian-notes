#### King Killers (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Rexxentrum]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 The characters intercept a cryptic note which indicates that there will be an attempt on King [[Bertrand Dwendal]]'s life the next time the monarch makes a public appearance. The characters are too inexperienced to get an audience with [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]] or anyone close to him, so it's up to the characters to thwart the plot. These [assassins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin) could be sent by the [[Kryn Dynasty]], the [[Cerberus Assembly]], [[the Myriad]], the cult of a [[Betrayer god]], or by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] itself to garner sympathy among the people. If the characters manage to stop the assassins, they earn the notice of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]], who will likely ask more of them.
