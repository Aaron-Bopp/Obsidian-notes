A human blacksmith named Wilhelm Arrisgon never returned from his latest journey to collect a wagon of raw materials. Wilhelm's family hires the characters to find the smith, and they trace him to [[Yrrosa]]. During their investigation, the characters discover that several other solitary travelers have disappeared while passing through the city. Velima Shanglian, a [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) who lives in a hidden lair outside Yrrosa, turned the travelers into her [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn). [[The Myriad]] has a deal with the vampire and sends victims her way in exchange for help with various unsavory tasks. If the characters destroy the vampire, they make an enemy of the Myriad.
