**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Grimgolir]]
**Level**:: Epic Level

 While the characters are in [[Grimgolir]], several [purple worms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/purple-worm) tunnel into the city, causing mass destruction. After the worms are killed or driven off, [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] forces come through the tunnels created by the monstrosities, razing strategic military outposts while the city is already in disarray. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] knows how critical the city is to training Dwendalian troops, so they mobilized the worms and followed behind to deal [[Grimgolir]] a decisive blow.
