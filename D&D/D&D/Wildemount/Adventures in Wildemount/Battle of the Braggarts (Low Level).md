#### Battle of the Braggarts (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Jigow]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 At a tavern, the adventurers witness two braggarts engage in a boast-off. The two boasters, a battle-scarred old [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc) named Temgor and a young [goblin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/goblin) named Gerb, are both prideful and refuse to back down. It seems like the conflict is going to come to blows, and both Temgor and Gerb's friends separately ask the adventurers to defuse the tensions before the [[Aurora Watch]] gets involved.
