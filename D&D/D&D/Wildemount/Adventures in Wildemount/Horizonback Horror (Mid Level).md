 A [horizonback tortoise](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/horizonback-tortoise) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#HorizonbackTortoise "chapter 7")) has broken away from Urzin's fleet and is rampaging through [[Jigow]]. The [[orcs]] and [[goblinkin]] fought to contain it, but every wound they inflict on the beast seems to stitch together before their eyes! An [oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oni) that once led a clan of trolls the [[orcs]] defeated several months ago is out for revenge and devised an alchemical infusion created from troll blood. The oni administered the toxin to the tortoise, granting it the Regeneration feature of a troll and causing it to go berserk, terrifying not only the denizens of [[Jigow]], but also the people clinging to their homes atop the frenzied tortoise.
