#### Smith Contest (Any Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Port Zoon]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 The characters get wind of a smithing contest to be held in Port Zoon. The winner gets a set of magic smith's tools and free tutelage from a master in the craft. If any characters participate, they should be wary: [[the Myriad]] wants those tools, and the competition is literally cutthroat.
