All trade and communication from [[Palebank Village]] (described below) halts suddenly and without warning. When the characters are sent to investigate, they find the entire area transformed into a frozen nightmare, the village leveled and the remaining corpses locked within jagged ice. Uthodurnian scouts report sightings of the long-dormant [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-dragon), [[Gelidon (High Level)]] returning to its lair in [[Mythburrow]].

The [[Diarchy of Uthodurn]] puts out the call to all monster hunters and heroes, setting a handsome bounty on the head of [[Gelidon (High Level)]]. The characters must now clamber down the twisting tunnels of the Mythburrow and destroy the powerful wyrm before their competition can claim the gold and glory.
