#### Lumberjack Madness (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Cyrengreen Forest]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 Lumberjacks from [[Deastok]] and [[Trostenwald]] working in the Cyrengreen have reported strange events. They fall asleep randomly on the job, witness twinkling lights, see horrific nightmarish creatures for mere moments — and some even turn into beasts such as frogs and rabbits for short periods of time. The loggers are spooked and refuse to return to their work until the characters deal with the problem. The problem is [pixies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pixie) — they're upset that the loggers are tearing their forest apart! The good fey are stubborn but might cut a deal with the loggers if the characters agree to negotiate.
