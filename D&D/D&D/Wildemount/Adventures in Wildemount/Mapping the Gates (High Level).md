#### Mapping the Gates (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Savalirwood]]
**Level**:: High Level

 Erma Schnieb (chaotic neutral lightfoot [[Halflings|halfling]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) believes that the curse infecting the [[Savalirwood]] creates portals to the Lower Planes. She hires the characters to explore the forest with her to find and map these gates. In addition to the usual nightmares that stalk the forest paths, fiends patrol the gates and attack anyone who tries to close the planar doors.
