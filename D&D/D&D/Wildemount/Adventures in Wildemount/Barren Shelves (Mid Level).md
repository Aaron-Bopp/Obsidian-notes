 [[Uthodurn]]'s stock of food is running out as winter approaches. The monarchs sponsor a mammoth-hunting contest, offering a prize of 1,000 gp to the team that brings back the largest [mammoth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth). If the characters wish to partake, they must hunt and kill the largest mammoth possible, then deal with a rival crew of adventurers that tries to take their kill by force.
