#### Take Back the Gate (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Wuyun Gate]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 As the characters travel through the region, they need to pass through the gate. When they get to the outpost, they learn that monsters from the mountains ([gnolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gnoll), [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin), [orcs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc), or [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll)) murdered the [[Crownsguard]] and have claimed the gate as their own. From this secure position, they launch more raids into the [[Marrow Valley]]. Someone has to stop them and take back the gate.
