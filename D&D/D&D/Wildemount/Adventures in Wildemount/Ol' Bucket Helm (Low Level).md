 Flocks of black gulls haunt the lonely north shores of the island, congregating around a seaside cave that attracts ordinary crabs and a few giant crabs as well. Just outside the cave mouth, someone has planted a grim scarecrow with a rusted bucket helm for a head, and anyone who tampers with the helm causes the black gulls to form into three hostile swarms (use the [swarm of ravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-ravens) stat block in appendix A of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")). The gulls also gather into swarms at the command of the cave's reclusive occupant, Peggy Silva, a sea hag with snails in her hair who wears an old fishing net as a shawl. A deranged kuo-toa whip named Plookoolp is the only company Peggy Silva tolerates.
