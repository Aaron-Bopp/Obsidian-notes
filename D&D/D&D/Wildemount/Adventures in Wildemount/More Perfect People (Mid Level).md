 Reports of wolves attacking travelers on the road from [[Deastok]], [[Kamordah]], and [[Trostenwald]] have become more frequent. All travelers tell the same story: the beasts tear through caravans, biting as many people as possible before moving on. There is never a death toll. The reason for the strange attacks becomes obvious during the next full moon when the bite victims turn into [werewolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werewolf). The characters are hired to find and stop the lycanthropes spreading the curse.


The instigating werewolves live in the dark heart of the Cyrengreen. They call themselves the Brotherhood of the Moon and aim to spread their curse throughout the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. They believe their mission will make humanoids evolve into a stronger, more perfect people.
