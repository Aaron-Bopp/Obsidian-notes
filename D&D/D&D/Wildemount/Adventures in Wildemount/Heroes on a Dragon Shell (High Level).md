**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Darktow]]
**Level**:: High Level

 The arrangement between the Plank King and the [dragon turtle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dragon-turtle) Idok of the Dragshallow Reefs has broken down, so the creature is now also sinking [[The Revelry|Revelry]] ships that attempt to enter or leave [[Darktow]]. The Plank King hires the characters to parley with Idok and find a way to meet the creature's demands, convince it to end its assaults, or slay it in its lair for a share of its treasure hoard.
