#### The Arcane Tree (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Syrinlya]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 While the characters are in Syrinlya, Morgo Delwur returns from an expedition with a bag of five green seeds from one of [[Eiselcross]]'s [[Aeor|Aeorian]] ruins. The [werebear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/werebear) lost a seed in the snow when showing them off, and a 15-foot-tall, green tree springs up overnight in the middle of the camp. Whenever a creature casts a spell that restores hit points or deals radiant damage to another creature within 90 feet of the tree, the tree uproots itself from the ground and attacks the creature. After killing the spellcasting creature and other threats, the tree replants its roots. Every 1d10 days the tree remains rooted, a new tree of the same type grows up from the ground within 30 feet. If the trees become a problem, Professor Gulgrim Shalebrow asks the characters to deal with them.


The [animated tree](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/animated-tree) uses the [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) stat block, with these changes:

-   It is unaligned.
-   It has resistance against necrotic damage and radiant damage.
-   It understands Common, Druidic, Elvish, and Sylvan but cannot speak.
