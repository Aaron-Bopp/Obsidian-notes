#### Steal the Plans (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Rockguard Garrison]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 Agents of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] hire the characters to infiltrate the [[Rockguard Garrison]] and uncover [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]'s plans to retake the [[Ashguard Garrison]]. The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] want any physical plans the characters find to remain in place to ensure [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] doesn't realize the plot, so all written documents containing key information need to be copied. The garrison's [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard), [scouts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout), and [veterans](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/veteran) patrol the place and question characters who obviously sneak around or don't belong.
