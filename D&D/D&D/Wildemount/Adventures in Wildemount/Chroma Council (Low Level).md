 A secret group of Draconian sympathizers, who call themselves the Chroma Council, tempts the young adults of Talonstadt with promises of wealth and a better life if they adhere to the commandments of [[Tiamat]]. Their recruits disappear into the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]] to meet with the cult leaders, who plan to raid passing caravans for money and supplies. The characters are hired by the recruits' families to steal them back from this seditious cult.
