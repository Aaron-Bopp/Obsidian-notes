#### Hell Hound Purge (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Silberquel Ridge]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 Marta Denizreitch (chaotic neutral, female, [[Humans|human]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) lives in a remote tower where she experiments with conjuration magic to develop new spells. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] funds Marta's research. Years ago, Marta had a problem with [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) attacking the tower, so she summoned [hell hounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hell-hound) to roam the wilds near her tower and keep the trolls at bay. She does not want the hell hounds to cause problems down the line, so she hires the characters to hunt a few to keep the population down. The characters discover they aren't the only ones killing hell hounds: a [hill giant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hill-giant) and a small gang of trolls are killing the hounds in preparation for an attack on Marta's tower!
