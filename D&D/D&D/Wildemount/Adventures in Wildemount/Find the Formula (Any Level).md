**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Trostenwald]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 The characters are hired by an anonymous entity to uncover the secrets of Trostenwald's ale. This means investigating all the rumors, infiltrating the brewing families to find recipes, and examining all the ingredients. The brewing families keep their secrets under lock and key. The plot thickens when the characters' anonymous patron wants to make sure the recipe doesn't get out, so they attempt to kill the characters when the mission is complete. This patron could be a member of [[the Myriad]], a family from [[Shadycreek Run]], or a rival brewery in another settlement.
