**Level**:: Mid Level

 Stumbling on a secret gathering of [cultists](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cultist) of [[Tiamat]] preparing to sacrifice a woman to their evil goddess, the adventurers must stop the ritual and free the captive, who aids them in the battle. She introduces herself as Calianna, a [[Half Elves|half-elf]] sorcerer with a draconic lineage that covers half of her body in black scales. She breathlessly describes this terrible cabal, known as the Cult of [[the Caustic Heart]] (see [chapter 2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#sidebarCultsDubiousWorshipFromTheShadows "chapter 2")), and requests the characters' aid in vanquishing it once and for all.
