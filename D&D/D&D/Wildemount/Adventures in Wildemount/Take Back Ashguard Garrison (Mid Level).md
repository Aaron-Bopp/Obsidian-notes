#### Take Back Ashguard Garrison (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Ashguard Garrison]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 The characters are tasked with taking back the stronghold for the empire. Since a direct assault on the stronghold would likely end in the characters' demise, they are encouraged to use magical disguises, infiltrate the outpost, and form a strategy over a period of months while they gather intelligence. During this time, the characters might learn that the [[Kryn Dynasty]] isn't the evil threat it was made out to be, prompting them to question their loyalties.
