#### A New Drink (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Berleben]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 People in [[Berleben]] are obsessed with swamp swill, a new whiskey that gets folk drunk more quickly and for longer. Some claim to have wonderful reveries while intoxicated by swamp swill, and many have become addicted to the stuff, resorting to violence to get their next drink. If the characters investigate, they find that a tribe of [lizardfolk](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/lizardfolk) is making the swill and giving it to a merchant in [[Berleben]] to sell. The lizardfolk plan to take over [[Berleben]] once enough people are dependent on the swill, but only because [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) threaten the lizardfolk's territory.
