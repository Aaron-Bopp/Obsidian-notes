 While the characters visit the city, they witness a noble drop dead as a [slaad tadpole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/slaad-tadpole) bursts from her chest. More nobles die in the same way as the characters investigate. They eventually discover that the victims all visited the same brothel, an establishment run by a [death slaad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-slaad) in disguise with several slaad bouncers.
