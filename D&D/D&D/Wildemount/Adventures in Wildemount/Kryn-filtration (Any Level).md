#### Kryn-filtration (Any Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Deastok]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 The [[Kryn Dynasty]] wants to infiltrate the nobility of Deastok to manipulate and steal information from wealthy Dwendalian citizens. The Kryn could hire the characters to accomplish this, or the characters could uncover the Kryn plot and try to find the [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy). In either case, [[the Myriad]]'s involvement in the city adds another dimension to the conflict between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and [[Kryn Dynasty]], making the characters wondering who — if anyone — they can trust.
