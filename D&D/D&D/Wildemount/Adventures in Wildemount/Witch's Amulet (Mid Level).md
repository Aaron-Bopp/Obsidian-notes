#### Witch's Amulet (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Ustaloch]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 Something in Ustaloch is turning the fish and crabs in the lake into skeletal abominations that attack boats and people near the shore. The characters are hired to uncover the source of this curse, which happens to be an amulet from the witch's island grove that a group of children discovered and threw in the water. If the characters can find and retrieve the amulet, the witch (a [night hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/night-hag)) might soon come looking for it.


To create the skeletal creatures in this adventure, take any aquatic beast and make the following changes to it:

-   The creature is undead and doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
-   It has immunity to poison damage and [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion), and it can't be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned).
-   It has vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
