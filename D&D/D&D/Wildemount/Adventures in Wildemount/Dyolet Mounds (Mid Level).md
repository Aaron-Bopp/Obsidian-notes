#### Dyolet Mounds (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Velvin Thicket]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 Herwin Melvot (chaotic neutral, male, forest gnome [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) attempted to grow a new kind of dyolet with magic. His experiment resulted in shambling mounds made of dyolet plants that terrorize the Thicket. The [[gnomes]] allow the characters into the forest if the adventurers slay the plant monsters.
