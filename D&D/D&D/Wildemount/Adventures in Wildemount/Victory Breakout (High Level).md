#### Victory Breakout (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Zadash]]
**Level**:: High Level

 The characters are in [[Zadash]] when several monsters are freed from their confines in the Victory Pit. These monsters â€” an [abominable yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti), a [behir](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/behir), a [hydra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hydra), a [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/tyrannosaurus-rex), and others, tear through the streets, leaving carnage in their wake. Did these monsters escape by themselves, or did someone else free them to distract the [[Crownsguard]] and characters while another crime took place?
