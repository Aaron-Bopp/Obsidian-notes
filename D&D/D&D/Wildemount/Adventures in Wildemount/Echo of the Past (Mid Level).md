 A chaotic good, male, [[dranassar]] survivor named Jibu-Corryn has been living as a [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] in [[Asarius]] under the name of Alyxikon, a minor government secretary. A cult of [hobgoblins](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/hobgoblin) and [bugbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bugbear) who call themselves the Lords of Strife are hunting Jibu after hearing a rumor that one of the last of the [[dranassar]] are hiding in [[Asarius]]. Their leader, a hobgoblin captain named Gorthux, possesses the power to transform into a [bone devil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bone-devil) once per day, and plans to offer Jibu as a sacrifice to [[Bane]].


Jibu has heard tales of the characters' prowess and contacts them with a cryptic note. He begs for protection while he settles his affairs in [[Asarius]] and travels to a hermitage in [[Blightshore]].
