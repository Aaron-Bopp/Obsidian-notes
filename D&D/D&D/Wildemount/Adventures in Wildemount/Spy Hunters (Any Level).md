 The [[Cerberus Assembly]] learns that [[Bertrand Dwendal|King Dwendal]]'s [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy) have infiltrated [[Balenpost]]. They hire the characters to find and report the spies to Wardlow Akron. The characters might uncover Karta Meck's network of four spies within the camp or find a lead-lined box among Karta's supplies which holds a [sending stone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sending-stones) paired with another held by [[Oliver Schreiber]]. If discovered, the spies attempt to win over the characters, promising an [[Aeor|Aeorian]] item in exchange for helping to discover what secrets are hidden in Horswell's lab.
