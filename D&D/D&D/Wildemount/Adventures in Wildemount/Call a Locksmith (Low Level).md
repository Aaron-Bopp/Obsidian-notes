#### Call a Locksmith (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Rexxentrum]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The exploits of the characters might draw the attention of the Locksmiths, a resistance group seeking to undermine the totalitarian rule of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]]. A friendly face the characters have come to know within the city invites them to meet Lady Quana Seledo (chaotic good, female, [[Humans|human]] [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/noble)), a well-connected figure who reveals herself to be a key figure in the Locksmiths. She asks the characters to join the cause, offering allies, rare goods, and well-paid work. If they agree, the first mission begins: help the Locksmiths infiltrate the office of Exchequer [[Aethia Drooze]] and steal the current year's tithe ledgers.
