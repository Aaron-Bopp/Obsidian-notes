#### Feeling Crabby (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Odessloe]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The residents of [[Odessloe]] fear that they somehow angered the spirit of the [[Erdeloch]]. Starving giant crabs from the lake have terrorized the Greenset region of the settlement every night for the past week. The cityfolk have left expensive offerings for the spirit on the lake's banks. These offerings are taken, but the crabs continue to attack. If the characters investigate, they find a group of bandits who are capturing and starving the crabs before releasing them into the settlement, and stealing the offerings for themselves. Are these ruffians connected to [[the Myriad]]? Could the stolen offerings anger the actual spirit of the lake enough to punish the settlement for the disrespect?
