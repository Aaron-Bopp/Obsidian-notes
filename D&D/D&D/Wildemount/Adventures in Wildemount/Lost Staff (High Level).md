**Level**:: High Level

 Farrhan Yost (lawful evil, female, human [archmage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/archmage)) was a part of the initial [[Cerberus Assembly]] team that explored [[Eiselcross]]. Now back on the mainland, she tells the characters she lost her [staff of power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-power) in Mutalos when the region was an ocean habitat, hoping it tempts them into exploring the region to find her old staff. As the characters search, she uses the [scrying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/scrying) spell to keep tabs on them. Should the characters discover her staff or any other interesting treasures, Farrhan teleports to their location with her shield guardian and offers a meager payment for the find. If the characters refuse, she attacks. Farrhan intends to get her staff back no matter what and wants to claim the characters' discoveries as her own.
