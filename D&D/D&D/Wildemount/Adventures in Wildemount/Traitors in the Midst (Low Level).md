#### Traitors in the Midst (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Nogvurot]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters are approached by Telva Cornwrath (neutral, female, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)), who claims to work for the [[Augen Trust]]. She hires the characters to infiltrate the ranks of the [[Righteous Brand]] in [[Nogvurot]] and discover which soldiers are accepting bribes from the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]]. She wants to know which criminal family pays each crooked official. She could be who she claims, or she might be a spy for [[The Myriad]] or one of the Tribes in [[Shadycreek Run]] looking to remove competition. In the latter case, she might not want the characters sticking around as loose ends.
