 An illegally transported [rust monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/rust-monster) escaped from its cage in the night, nested within the Silberquel Mines, and gave birth to a small brood. The hungry creatures now threaten to consume the veins of ore needed for the empire's war effort, unless the characters manage to slay or capture them.
