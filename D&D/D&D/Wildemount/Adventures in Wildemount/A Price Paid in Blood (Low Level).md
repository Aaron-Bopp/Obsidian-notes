 A series of macabre murders have shaken the denizens of [[Felderwin]]. The watchmaster has heard rumors that a [blood hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/blood-hunter) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#BloodHunter "[[chapter 7]]")) recently arrived in the city and hires the characters to hunt down the possible murderer. When they finally find the [[blood hunter]], she tries to convince them that the murders are the fault of a rakshasa that's secretly living within the settlement as the watchmaster. The characters must either help the [[blood hunter]] take down the watchmaster or capture the [[blood hunter]] to claim their reward.
