**Level**:: Epic Level

 A powerful artifact of the long-deceased Archmage Oleyahs has been recovered from the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] and is secretly in transit to Bysaes Tyl. Researchers hope that this object holds a key to understanding the destruction of their ancestral home, but when the object arrives, it is revealed to instead be a deceptive casing for the archmage's [demilich](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/demilich) form. A plague of arcane terror rains on Bysaes Tyl, and the characters are tasked by the Ring of Three to destroy or banish the demilich Oleyahs from the burning city.
