#### Fire in the Mines (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Druvenlode]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 A being made of fire attacked miners from the Surgoth Guild who were working a vein of silver ore. The miners survived but are too scared to go back into the mine. Instead, they gamble their savings away at the Sterling Satchel. If the characters investigate, they find a path of destruction in the mine that leads to a [fire elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-elemental) under the control of Casper Windmouth (neutral evil, male, [[Humans|human]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)). Casper is a gambler with many debts to pay, so he took a job from an anonymous source to scare the miners out. Was it a rival miner's guild? Was it the proprietors of the Sterling Satchel, looking to hang on to their customers day and night? Or was it the owner of the Cabin of Fortune, hoping to bankrupt their competitor's clients?
