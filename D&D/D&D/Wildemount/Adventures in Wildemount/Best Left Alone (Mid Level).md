**Location**:: [[Xarzith Kitril]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 One of the prominent mining companies within the city has recently uncovered a mysterious purple stone of unknown origin, about fifteen feet in diameter. Dozens of superstitious miners have fled this site, so the company hires the characters to investigate the stone and uncover its nature. When any of the stone's smooth, reflective surface takes damages, this buried relic of the Shadowfell begins to summon [shadowghasts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/shadowghast) and [gloomstalkers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gloomstalker) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#Gloomstalker "chapter 7")) at an increasingly fast rate. The characters must discover a way to repair and reseal the stone, destroy it, or banish it from [[Exandria]] before the city is overwhelmed.
