**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Palebank Village]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 While the characters stay in Palebank Village, the only survivor of an unlucky Glassblades patrol staggers into the village. An organized band of [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) is coming down from the [[Flotket Alps]] toward the settlement, which needs every able-bodied warrior to keep the trolls at bay. How did these trolls get so organized, and what do they seek in the village?
