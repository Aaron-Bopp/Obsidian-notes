#### Lost Xagonstar (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Ebonglass Massif]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The adventurers travel to Ebonglass Massif by airship to join a well-funded archaeological expedition mounted by Duurek Kronst, a wealthy dwarf who is determined to find the dwarven stronghold of Xagonstar, lost and buried since [[the Calamity]]. An unnatural storm sweeping across [[Blightshore]] causes the airship to crash, but the characters survive. Once they reach the dig site, they see that great progress has already been made. The first great hall of Xagonstar has been discovered! Unfortunately, the archaeologists are missing and the site has been abandoned. Were the diggers captured by the Fang of the Worm or carried off by a hungry [gloomstalker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/[[gloomstalker]]) (as described in [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/[[wildemount]]-bestiary#[[Gloomstalker]] "chapter 7")), or did something slip out of Xagonstar to devour them?
