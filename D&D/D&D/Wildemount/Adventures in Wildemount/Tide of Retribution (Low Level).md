**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Palma Flora]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 [[Palma Flora]]'s shark-hunting tradition has earned its people the ire of a [sahuagin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sahuagin) clan living in the Sharkfeather Abyss, a nearby undersea trench. The sahuagin tend to their flock of sharks peacefully and view the shark-hunters as cruel poachers. One sahuagin has made a pact with the leviathan Uk'otoa and sworn vengeance on the people of [[Palma Flora]]. This adventure hook is expanded into a full introductory adventure in [chapter 5](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/adventures-in-[[wildemount]]-tide-of-retribution "chapter 5").
