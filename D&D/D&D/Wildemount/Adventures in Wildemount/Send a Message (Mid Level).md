 The characters are hired — or blackmailed — by [[The Myriad]] to convince [[Starosta Wyatt Fedar]] to let [[The Myriad]] quell unrest in the city in exchange for favors from the city leader. If the [[starosta]] accepts, [[The Myriad]] asks the characters to crack down on non-[[The Myriad|Myriad]] crime in the city. If the [[starosta]] refuses, [[The Myriad]] asks the characters to run amok, causing and inspiring as much chaos as possible until the [[starosta]] relents.
