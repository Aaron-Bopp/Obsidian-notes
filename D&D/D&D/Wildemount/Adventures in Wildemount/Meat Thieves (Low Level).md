#### Meat Thieves (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Tomb of the Worm]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 As the characters explore [[Gelier]], they cross paths with a group of four [[wildfolk]] commoners led by Jarinmine. The [[Halflings|halfling]] begs them to take a 300-pound package of meat to the sea and dump it in the icy water. She warns the characters not to eat it and offers them her ivory necklace (worth 100 gp) if they agree to the task. If pressed, she says the meat is tainted and that it turns people into slaves for [[Galgonos]]. Jarinmine stole the meat from the wormkin because she believes the diet poisons their minds. She needs to get back to the [[Tomb of the Worm]] before [[Galgonos]] realizes what she's done.


Before the characters reach the sea, six wormkin catch up to them. Their leader is [[Redjaw]], and the others are cultists, all with the wormkin template applied. [[Redjaw]] demands that the characters give back the food that was stolen and forces a fight if the characters refuse. If the characters return the meat, [[Redjaw]] invites them back to the [[Tomb of the Worm]]. If the characters go to the village, they find that Jarinmine and her friends have been captured by the wormkin and are about to be executed for their crimes.
