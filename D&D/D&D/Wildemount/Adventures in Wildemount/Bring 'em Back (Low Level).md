 Talamin Raanan (chaotic neutral, female, high [[Elves|elf]] [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)) once worked for the [[tribes of Shadycreek Run]] as an assassin. The [[Elves|elf]] disappeared five years ago, but spies report that she resides in Gwardan under the name Valemis Tirdra. One of the Shadycreek Tribes, or a faction that wants to see Talamin pay for her crimes, hires the characters to capture the [[Elves|elf]]. When the characters find Talamin, they learn that all she desires is to leave her violent past behind and live out her days with her new family, including her two young children.
