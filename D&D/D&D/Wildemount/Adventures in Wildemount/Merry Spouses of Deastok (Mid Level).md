#### Merry Spouses of Deastok (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Deastok]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 A member of the nobility in Deastok is murdered, and the characters are hired to find the killer. During the investigation, more nobles and prominent members of society are slain. It seems the victims cannot be connected, and each murder employs a different grisly method. The truth is that a group of [incubi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/incubus) and [succubi](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/succubus) married into the [[Truscan family]] over the past decade. These fiends are committing murders for the thrill of it.
