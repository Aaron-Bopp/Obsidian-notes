#### Vault of the Fire Giants (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Kravaraad]]
**Level**:: High Level

 [[Kravaraad]]'s [fire giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-giant) have greedily amassed treasure since the time before [[the Calamity]]. To reach their subterranean vault, the characters must sneak by or carve through the latest creatures who have challenged the fire giants (often [frost giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-giant) or other creatures that can endure the cold). But making it to the fire giants is only half the battle. The fire giants have hewn a vast dungeon under the mountain, and characters must navigate its perils while maintaining their balance whenever [[Kravaraad]] causes the entire complex to tremble. The vault itself is guarded by an enslaved [adult red dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-red-[[dragon]]) that longs to be free.
