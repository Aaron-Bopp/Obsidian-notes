**Location**:: [[Dumaran]]
**Level**:: High Level

 Intercepted messages between the [[Children of Malice]] speak of a ritual that is being prepared in the heart of Dumaran in the coming weeks. Victims have been captured for a mass sacrifice, and the messages mention a "great arrival." The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to uncover more information about this ritual, attempt to release any prisoners, and, should the opportunity present itself, stop this ritual or destroy whatever arrives at its completion.
