 Aramue, a [dryad](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/dryad) of the Vermaloc Wildwood and devout follower of the Wild Mother, possesses a unique gift: she can send dreams to other worshipers of [[Melora]]. Using this power, she reaches out to such individuals. Aramue needs help ridding her forest of an [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ettercap) that has taken control of many of the forest's [giant spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-spider). The spiders attack the forest's outlying settlements and bring prisoners to the ettercap, which it sacrifices to gain [[Lolth]]'s favor. The dryad is kept awake at night by the ettercap's screaming victims.
