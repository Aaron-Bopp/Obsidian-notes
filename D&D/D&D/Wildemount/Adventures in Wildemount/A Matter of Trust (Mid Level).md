#### A Matter of Trust (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Allowak's Sanctuary]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 As the characters travel [[Foren]], they find Dawnmind, a female Allowak [yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti-allowak-variant) (see "[[Allowak's Sanctuary]] Yeti Statistics") holding the tatters of a net as she lies in the snow, covered in claw wounds from others of her kind, with 1 hit point remaining. Three other yeti corpses, Dawnmind's companions, lie in the bloody snow nearby. Dawnmind begs the characters to escort her back to [[Allowak's Sanctuary]] along with the corpses. Her group failed to capture six wild yetis, but those yetis are nearby and stalk the characters if they help Dawnmind.


If the characters travel to [[Allowak's Sanctuary]] with Dawnmind, Brightheart welcomes them as heroes and thanks them with a place to stay, provided that they swear to keep [[Allowak's Sanctuary]] a secret â€” or the [abominable yeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/abominable-yeti) could order the characters to prove their loyalty by capturing a group of wild yetis or [mammoths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth) for her.
