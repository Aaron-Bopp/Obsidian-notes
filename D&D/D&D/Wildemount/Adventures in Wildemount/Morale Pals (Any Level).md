**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Bladegarden]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 [[Bertrand Dwendal|The Crown]] sends the Morale Pals, a famous comedic [[Halflings|halfling]] duo, to keep spirits up in [[Bladegarden]]. But when the curtain goes up on opening night, it reveals the decapitated bodies of the Morale Pals! The characters are hired to answer the question everyone is asking: who killed the [[halflings]]? It might be [[Xhorhas|Xhorhasian]] [spies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy) determined to keep morale low, thieves who wanted the [[halflings]]' purses, or perhaps a rogue killer who wanted to send a message to the whole city that this is just the beginning.
