#### An Early Dawn (Any Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 While the characters are visiting Rosohna, the shadows above the city suddenly disappear, letting in harsh light that hinders the [drow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/drow) and [duergar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/[[duergar]]) residents. Is this phenomenon part of an imminent attack, or did the [[Kryn Dynasty]] anger [[the Luxon]] and must figure out a way to regain their god's favor?
