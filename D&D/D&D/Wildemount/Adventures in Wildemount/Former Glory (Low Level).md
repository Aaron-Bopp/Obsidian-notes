**Level**:: Low Level

 A cabal of disaffected [[Dragonborn|draconblood]] [[dragonborn]] have been secretly assembling in the ruins of their former metropolis. They are guided by the whispers of a [death knight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/death-knight) who promises them the power to reassert control over the ravenites. They have begun learning necromancy and even making minor sacrifices in his name. The death knight, Pentrakath, is currently gathering artifacts elsewhere in [[Wildemount]], but will soon use his cultists and cult fanatics to carry out his twisted plans, if no one intervenes (see "[Dreemoth Ravine Adventures](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-wastes-of-[[xhorhas]]#DreemothRavineAdventures "[[Dreemoth Ravine]] Adventures")" earlier in this chapter).
