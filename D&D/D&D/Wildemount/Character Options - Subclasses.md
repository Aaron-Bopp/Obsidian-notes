This section includes three new subclass options: the [[Echo Knight]] for the fighter and Chronurgy Magic and Graviturgy Magic for the wizard.

## Dunamis and Dunamancy

[[Dunamancy|Dunamis]] is the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. Manifesting as a translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.

[[Dunamancy]] is an ancient, esoteric study of magic almost unknown across [[Exandria]]. Facets of [[dunamancy]] have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves [[Dunamancy|dunamancers]], and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.

### Beyond the Kryn Dynasty

Although the [[Kryn Dynasty]] is responsible for the carefully guarded development and refining of [[dunamancy]], the mysteries of this magical art have long since spread beyond the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]]’s borders. The hidden secrets of harnessing [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] eventually found their way into the hands of the [[Cerberus Assembly]] and have continued to slowly disseminate across all [[Wildemount]] as a result.

If you are considering a character pursuing a path involving the manipulation of [[Dunamancy|dunamis]], you can easily tie your story into the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the ready access to [[dunamancy]] it provides. But you can also consider where else in the world [[dunamancy]] might have spread, and how its secrets have influenced your character’s path. You might have stumbled into a cabal of defecting [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] expatriates who teach you their ways, or you might have been entrusted with learning such secrets as a means of fighting the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] with their own power. Work with your Dungeon Master and figure out a fun and logical way that your character and the mysterious power of [[dunamancy]] might have crossed paths.

In campaigns outside [[Wildemount]], there is no factional control of [[dunamancy]], so the implementation of this arcane discipline is entirely open. Talk to your Dungeon Master about how [[dunamancy]] might fit into their campaign, and how your character’s story could be woven into that lore.

### Dunamis as a Martial Focus

Life is an extended series of choices. Every crossroads offers paths to different possibilities. The reality of each possible choice begins to coalesce as you approach the moment of decision, with multiple timelines humming with opportunity. Once a choice is made, one path sparks to life and continues while others fade, their energy of potentiality diffusing into the multiverse. A rare few characters learn to invoke and harness this released [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] in the throes of battle to enhance their martial capabilities—and such warriors are uniformly feared.

## Fighter

The fighter takes many forms in [[Wildemount]], from the grizzled mercenary who earns their keep by the might of their blade, to the dedicated soldier who fights for the banner of their homeland, to the hearty treasure hunter whose skill with a weapon is their finest asset.

At 3rd level, a fighter gains the Martial Archetype class feature described in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook"). The [[Echo Knight]] is a new option for that feature.

[[Echo Knight]]

### Echo Knight

A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], the [[Echo Knight]] has mastered the art of using [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.

#### Manifest Echo

_3rd-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You can use a bonus action to magically manifest an echo of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another echo, or until you’re [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated).

Your echo has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

You can use the echo in the following ways:

-   As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
-   When you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the echo’s space. You make this choice for each attack.
-   When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo’s space.

#### Unleash Incarnation

_3rd-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You can heighten your echo’s fury. Whenever you take the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/combat#Attack) action, you can make one additional melee attack from the echo’s position.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Echo Avatar

_7th-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You can temporarily transfer your consciousness to your echo. As an action, you can see through your echo’s eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened) and [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded). You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed.

#### Shadow Martyr

_10th-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You can make your echo throw itself in front of an attack directed at another creature that you can see. Before the attack roll is made, you can use your reaction to teleport the echo to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the targeted creature. The attack roll that triggered the reaction is instead made against your echo.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Reclaim Potential

_15th-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You’ve learned to absorb the fleeting magic of your echo. When an echo of yours is destroyed by taking damage, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Constitution modifier, provided you don’t already have temporary hit points.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### _Legion of One_

_18th-level [[Echo Knight]] feature_

You can use a bonus action to create two echoes with your Manifest Echo feature, and these echoes can coexist. If you try to create a third echo, the previous two echoes are destroyed. Anything you can do from one echo’s position can be done from the other’s instead.

In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of your Unleash Incarnation feature left, you regain one use of that feature.

## Wizard

The brightest minds of [[Wildemount]] often find themselves gravitating to the ancient and dangerous study of magic. Some train for decades within the halls and towers of academies, while others learn their craft in the shadows, keeping their discoveries to themselves.

At 2nd level, a wizard gains the Arcane Tradition class feature described in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook"). Chronurgy Magic and Graviturgy Magic are two new traditions available to wizards.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-17.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-17.png)

Chronurgy Wizard

### Chronurgy Magic

Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking. Using the ramping of anticipatory [[Dunamancy|dunamis]] energy, these mages can bend the flow of time as adroitly as a skilled musician plays an instrument, lending themselves and their allies an advantage in the blink of an eye.

#### Chronal Shift

_2nd-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.

You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Temporal Awareness

_2nd-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can add your Intelligence modifier to your initiative rolls.

#### Momentary Stasis

_6th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically force a Large or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the saving throw is a success, the creature is encased in a field of magical energy until the end of your next turn or until the creature takes any damage. While encased in this way, the creature is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) and has a speed of 0.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Arcane Abeyance

_10th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

When you cast a spell using a spell slot of 4th level or lower, you can condense the spell’s magic into a mote. The spell is frozen in time at the moment of casting and held within a gray bead for 1 hour. This bead is a Tiny object with AC 15 and 1 hit point, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. When the duration ends, or if the bead is destroyed, it vanishes in a flash of light, and the spell is lost.

A creature holding the bead can use its action to release the spell within, whereupon the bead disappears. The spell uses your spell attack bonus and save DC, and the spell treats the creature who released it as the caster for all other purposes.

Once you create a bead with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Convergent Future

_14th-level Chronurgy Magic feature_

You can peer through possible futures and magically pull one of them into events around you, ensuring a particular outcome. When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to ignore the die roll and decide whether the number rolled is the minimum needed to succeed or one less than that number (your choice).

When you use this feature, you gain one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion). Only by finishing a long rest can you remove a level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion) gained in this way.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-18.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-18.png)

Graviturgy Wizard

### Graviturgy Magic

Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.

#### Adjust Density

_2nd-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or creature must be Large or smaller. The target’s weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell).

While the weight of a creature is halved by this effect, the creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. While the weight of a creature is doubled by this effect, the creature’s speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

Upon reaching 10th level in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.

#### Gravity Well

_6th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

You’ve learned how to manipulate gravity around a living being: whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.

#### Violent Attraction

_10th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase the attack’s velocity, causing the attack’s target to take an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon’s type.

Alternatively, if a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to increase the fall’s damage by 2d10.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Event Horizon

_14th-level Graviturgy Magic feature_

As an action, you can magically emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher on it.

## Dunamancy Spells

This section presents a sampling of spells developed through the manipulation of [[Dunamancy|dunamis]]. These spells are available to the wizard subclasses previously mentioned in this chapter, as well as other spellcasting classes with the Dungeon Master’s consent (see the “[[Dunamancy]] for Non-[[Dunamancy|Dunamancers]]” sidebar).

### Dunamancy Spell List

## Spell Descriptions

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

### Dark Star

_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of onyx and a drop of the caster’s blood, both of which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.

For the duration, the spell’s area is difficult terrain. A creature with [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) can’t see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

Any creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except [[magic items]], are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

[[Dark Star]]

### Fortune’s Favor

_2nd-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a white pearl worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

### Gift of Alacrity

_1st-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target can add 1d8 to its initiative rolls.

### Gravity Fissure

_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (100-foot line)

**Components:** V, S, M (a fistful of iron filings)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You manifest a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 8d8 force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature is in its area.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

### Gravity Sinkhole

_4th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a black marble)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pulled.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

### Immovable Object

_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds and cause it to become magically fixed in place. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.

If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the DC to move the object increases by 5, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the DC to move the object increases by 10, it can carry up to 20,000 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

### Magnify Gravity

_1st-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.

Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn’t being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Pulse Wave

_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance pulled or pushed increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

### Ravenous Void

_9th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1,000 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a small, nine-pointed star made of iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell’s duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren’t being worn or carried.

When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.

A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere’s center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

### Reality Break

_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a crystal prism)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the [[Reality Break]] Effects table.

At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

d10

Effect

1–2

Vision of the [[Far Realm]]. The target takes 6d12 psychic damage, and it is [stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Stunned) until the end of the turn.

3–5

Rending Rift. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

6–8

Wormhole. The target is teleported, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The target also takes 10d12 force damage and is knocked [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).

9–10

Chill of the Dark Void. The target takes 10d12 cold damage, and it is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) until the end of the turn.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-20.png)

[[Reality Break]]

### Sapping Sting

_Necromancy cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You sap the vitality of one creature you can see in range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 necrotic damage and fall [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).

This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

### Temporal Shunt

_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, taken when a creature you can see makes an attack roll or starts to cast a spell

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You target the triggering creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or vanish, being thrown to another point in time and causing the attack to miss or the spell to be wasted. At the start of its next turn, the target reappears where it was or in the closest unoccupied space. The target doesn’t remember you casting the spell or being affected by it.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

### Tether Essence

_7th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a spool of platinum cord worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.

### Time Ravage

_9th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass filled with diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the [wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) spell or the [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/greater-restoration) cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.

### Wristpocket

_2nd-level conjuration (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You flick your wrist, causing one object in your hand to vanish. The object, which only you can be holding and can weigh no more than 5 pounds, is transported to an extradimensional space, where it remains for the duration.

Until the spell ends, you can use your action to summon the object to your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the spell ends appears in your space, at your feet.

## Heroic Chronicle

The [[heroic chronicle]] is a system that allows players and Dungeon Masters to work together to build a compelling character story. It even allows characters to gain additional proficiencies, [[magic items]], spells, or feats before the campaign begins. This section assumes that the player is starting from scratch—without having chosen a race, class, or background for their character. The events that occur as a result of these random rolls inform what kind of character the player has. A player who already has a character concept in mind can choose options from the tables instead of rolling randomly, ignoring anything that doesn’t fit their character concept. If you’re a player using these tables, don’t be surprised if creating a backstory inspires you to change some aspect of your character concept. Let this tool inspire your imagination rather than limit it.

The “Backstory” section of the chronicle roots a character’s history in the land of [[Wildemount]] by helping the player determine the character’s nation, home settlement, and relationships with family members, allies, and rivals. It helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began. Options for determining a character’s favorite food and mysterious secrets can help further define a character’s relationship to their homeland and the other party members.

The “Prophecy” section of the chronicle sets out three aspirations or goals that the player has for their character. Prophecy goals can help players and DMs create engaging stories that make the game more interesting. Each time a goal is met, it takes on a prophetic tone as a character achieves something they were driven or destined to do. Completing a prophecy goal grants the character a mechanical benefit as a reward.

Dungeon Masters can also use the [[heroic chronicle]] process to generate villains with histories and motivations grounded in the dangerous lands of [[Wildemount]].

### Backstory

A character’s story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.

#### Homeland

The known lands of [[Wildemount]] are divided into four major geographic regions, each of which is described in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "[[chapter 3]]"). From west to east, these regions are the [[Menagerie Coast]], [[Western Wynandir]] (which is further divided into the [[Marrow Valley]] and the [[Zemni Fields]]), the [[Greying Wildlands]], and [[Eastern Wynandir]]. The northernmost reaches of the continent—the forgotten lands of [[Eiselcross]]—are not included in this section.

Roll a d100 and consult the Homelands table to determine which region you were born in. If you were born in one region but grew up in another, roll twice on the table to determine your place of birth and the region you eventually settled in.

##### Homelands

d100

01–21

[[Menagerie Coast]] (choose either the [[Clovis Concord]] or [[The Revelry|Revelry]] pirates)

[[Greying Wildlands]] (choose either the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]] or [[Uthodurn]])

78–00

[[Xhorhas]] in [[Eastern Wynandir]] (choose either the [[Kryn Dynasty]] or [[Xarzith Kitril]])

#### Background

In addition to granting you items, gold, and proficiencies, your background gives you a sense of belonging in the world. You can roll on the [[Backgrounds]] table to randomly determine your character’s background, or you can choose one that fits your character concept. This table includes new [[backgrounds]] and adapted [[backgrounds]] from this book (EGW) as well as the [[backgrounds]] from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") (PH). New and adapted [[backgrounds]] are described later in this chapter.

Your background determines your place in the world. Within the strict hierarchy of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], a family with a poor social status is worth less than the soil they till, while a family of great renown enjoys all the privileges of high society. Most folk toil in the same profession from the day they’re old enough to work until the day they die, and few families ever rise to glory from obscurity. That’s just the way of things.

You, however, are an adventurer. Though your social status is determined by your background and your country of origin, you have the power to rebel against the hierarchies of your land and change your fate. Your background doesn’t change, nor do the proficiencies and other benefits you gain because of it. But the social status associated with your background might shift over the course of your backstory—and over the course of your adventures.

Each nation in [[Wildemount]] views people’s [[backgrounds]] according to its cultural values. Based on your character’s background, think about your social status within the context of the details of your homeland presented below. Then use the Social Status Relationships table to determine how many allies and rivals you’ll roll for later on in this section.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-21.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-21.png)

**_Menagerie Coast._** Both the [[Clovis Concord]] and their hated nemesis, [[the Revelry]] pirates, prize personal freedom over all other things. [[The Revelry]] simply takes this ideology one bloody step further. People of the [[Clovis Concord|Concord]] celebrate folk heroes and entertainers, and all other people who might become celebrities, iconoclasts, and figures of legend.

At the same time, the common working-class sailor is a symbol of the [[Clovis Concord|Concord]]’s strength. As with the crew of a well-run ship, the small actions of individuals can have a huge impact when all are working toward common goals. Common sailors despise [[the Revelry]], and noteworthy sailors might even have a rival within [[the Revelry]].

**_Western Wynandir._** The [[Dwendalian Empire]] prizes king and country over personal freedoms—at least as far as the freedoms of the poor are concerned. For the wealthy noble class, most laws are mere guidelines, since bribery and political favors can make almost any problem go away.

In the [[Dwendalian Empire]], rural folk are seen as honest, hardworking, and pious, while the wealthy ruling class are viewed as beneficent patricians—or as miserly tyrants. Patriotism is a core virtue, and enlisting in the [[Righteous Brand]] and adhering to the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s strict religious laws are the most patriotic acts of all.

**_Greying Wildlands._** The [[Greying Wildlands]] and the settlement of [[Shadycreek Run]] are lawless. Crime is a virtue here, mercy a vice. Only strength rules in the land run by the coalition of criminals known as “the Tribes.” Anyone who doesn’t have the personal strength to defend themself is treated with contempt, and those who represent the iron fist of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] are utterly despised.

Travel farther north, however, and one reaches the [[Diarchy of Uthodurn]], a stable and ancient city ruled by [[elves]] and [[dwarves]]. Here, order and art are prized over chaos and personal enrichment. If your character is from [[Uthodurn]] rather than [[Shadycreek Run]], replace any rival you gain from the Social Status Relationships table with an ally, and vice-versa.

**_Eastern Wynandir._** Accumulating knowledge and achieving spiritual enlightenment are the virtues of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], whose society is built around the tenets of [[the Luxon]]. Artists, entertainers, artisans, and all people who create are well-valued in [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] society. Yet in this age of war, people whose skills allow them to destroy are paradoxically prized just as highly.

To the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], a person’s background is less important than the experiences they’ve accumulated—particularly for those who have begun walking the sacred path known as [[consecution]]. Nonetheless, even the most enlightened society can’t help but look down upon its lowest citizens and sneer at its haughty elite. Once all beings are beloved by [[the Luxon]], perhaps these ills of society will be purged once and for all.

#### Home Settlement

Once you’ve determined your nation and considered your social status within that realm, roll on the appropriate table in this section to determine which settlement you grew up in. If your character is a traveler—a child of soldiers, a nomad, a traveling performer, and so forth—you can roll for up to three settlements that you’ve visited often and have some connections in.

Each home settlement is detailed in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "[[chapter 3]]"). If your home settlement doesn’t make sense for your social status, you can either roll for a different settlement or think about ways to make a contradiction work for your backstory. For example, if you have the Noble background but rolled a village as a home settlement, perhaps you were raised there to protect you from your family’s enemies.

#### Race

You can determine your character’s race by consulting the section for your home settlement in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "[[chapter 3]]"). Each settlement’s description includes a percentile breakdown of its racial demographics. You can roll a d100 to determine your character’s race, or simply choose whichever race you wish to play. If your roll indicates “other [[races]],” you can choose any race that isn’t already represented in the settlement’s demographics.

#### Family

The size of your home settlement plays a part in the size of your family. Villages in [[Wildemount]] are predominantly rural, and families need children to tend their farms and perform household duties. By contrast, land and commodities are expensive in the cities, making it difficult for many people to afford a large family.

Families with at least three children often encourage one child, typically the eldest, to continue the family trade. The other children are encouraged to travel so as to learn a new trade, become a scholar, become apprenticed to a master guild artisan, or similar activities. Imperial families who can afford to do so might even send one or more children to [[Rexxentrum]], where they can learn magic at the [[Soltryce Academy]].

Roll twice on the appropriate Family Size table—once to determine how many living parents you have, and once to determine your living siblings. The state of your family might change over the course of your backstory, just as it might change over the course of the campaign.

**_Parents_**. You might have been blessed with two loving parents, or you might have helped your single parent take care of the rest of your family. You might have been raised by three or more parents, whether because those parents engage in a polyamorous relationship, one or both parents had multiple spouses, or you were raised communally. Or you might have no parents, whether you were orphaned early in life or have outlived the parents you did have.

**_Siblings._** Your siblings can include your parents’ other children, half-siblings from your parents’ other marriages or affairs, cousins who are as close as siblings, or beloved friends who became siblings by bond rather than by blood.

#### Family Member Traits

Once you’ve determined the size of your family, choose the gender and age of each family member.

#### Powerful Family Relationships

Even before your adventuring career began, you had allies who supported you and rivals who sought to thwart your success. In some cases, your allies might be so devoted that they are indispensable companions, while your rivals are hateful enough to make them nothing short of mortal enemies.

Your first allies and rivals are your family. Sometimes your family members are your closest friends. Sometimes you hate their guts. Roll a d3. This is the number of powerful relationships you have within your family.

Roll once on the Family Relationships table for each powerful relationship you have within your family, to determine the setup of your friendship or rivalry.

d100

01–10

You thought you killed this family member, whether by accident or otherwise. You never expected to see them again—but now they’re out for your blood. You gain one rival.

11–20

You insulted this family member so gravely that they left your life forever. If they ever return, it will be to settle the score. You gain one rival.

31–40

You uncovered a secret about this family member, whether a tiny embarrassment or a life-changing scandal. They now seek to unveil your darkest secret. You gain one rival.

41–50

You and this family member have a friendly rivalry, and are constantly trying to best each other in an activity, craft, or other pursuit. You visit occasionally to test each other’s skills. You gain one rival.

This family member owes you a debt, and they don’t like it. They’ll help you out when you need it, but only to clear the slate. You gain one ally.

61–70

This family member loves you, but you were never that close. They’ll do anything to help you—as long as they won’t be at risk of injury or death. You gain one ally.

71–80

This family member caused you to have a horrible accident when you were a child. They still feel incredible guilt, which they would do anything to assuage. You gain one ally.

81–90

This family member left long ago for reasons you don’t understand or won’t talk about. Before they left, they promised you that they would return in your hour of greatest need. You gain one ally.

91–00

This family member has always loved you with all their heart, and would do anything for you. You gain one ally.

#### Acquired Allies and Rivals

If you gained allies or rivals based on your background and your homeland, this section allows you to establish your relationship with those allies and rivals, as well as the broad strokes of their identities. Start by rolling once on the Ally Relationships or Rival Relationships table for each of those allies and rivals. Alternatively, you and your DM can work together to create ally or rival relationships that enhance your character’s story.

When you’ve determined the relationships between you and your acquired allies and rivals, roll for each one on the Ally and Rival Identities table to determine their game statistics. This table includes monsters and NPCs in this book (EGW) and in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_ (MM).

If you roll a particularly powerful ally or rival on this table, their involvement in your life causes a fateful moment to occur in your backstory, as determined in the next section.

d100

Relationship

01–10

This ally is a loyal pet. Rather than rolling on the Ally and Rival Identities table, choose one beast of CR 1/8 or lower as your pet.

11–20

This person once lost a bet to you and is still trying to scrounge up the cash to pay you back. They’ve decided you’d both be better off if they put you in their debt instead.

21–30

This person was once a beggar to whom you gave a large sum of money. They have transformed their life thanks to you, and now want to repay your generosity.

31–40

You were this person’s favorite drinking buddy, and their home is always open to you and your friends.

41–50

This person was once your mentor, but you left before you could complete your training. You are welcome to return and finish what you started, but only when you are ready.

51–60

You bonded with this person over a traumatic event such as a battle or an armed robbery. If you ever tell them that you are in danger, they will try to aid you.

61–70

You and this person share a terrible secret, and you have sworn to never reveal it to anyone. They will help you keep this secret if it is ever in danger of being revealed.

This person fell in love with you. If you reciprocated, they always stand at your side. If you didn’t, they took it well, and still consider you their closest friend.

81–90

You and this person were affected by powerful magic, and now you both share a telepathic connection that functions while you are within 1 mile of each other.

91–00

This person owes you their life. Even if they can’t follow you everywhere you go, they will do anything they can to protect you.

d100

Relationship

01–10

This person believes that you murdered their sibling. Regardless of your guilt or innocence, they are out for your blood.

11–20

You bested this person in combat, but they believe you cheated to defeat them. They long to prove that they are the superior warrior.

21–30

You broke a promise to this person, and it caused them to suffer greatly. Now they conspire to make someone else break a valuable promise to you.

31–40

You once loved this person, but broke their heart. They are now obsessed with making you feel the same pain they felt.

41–50

This person was ordered to arrest you, and doggedly hunts you wherever you go.

51–60

This person thinks that you were replaced by a doppelganger or possessed by a spirit or monster. They are now trying to defeat you, so as to find or free the original you.

61–70

You fled from your home under mysterious circumstances. This person is obsessed with finding out the truth of what caused you to leave.

71–80

You and this person tried to harness power beyond your control, and it left them disfigured and in constant pain. Having since mastered the power that nearly destroyed them, they now seek to turn it upon you.

81–90

You helped this person out once when they were down on their luck, and now they go to you whenever they need help.

91–00

This person wants to be your friend, but their help has always made your life harder.

**_Secret Identities._** Some of these allies and rivals might keep their true identity secret from your character. The DM can decide to make one or more of the rolls on the Ally and Rival Identities table to keep the secret intact. [[Stat blocks]] appear in either appendix B of the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_ (MM) or [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary "[[chapter 7]]") of this book (EGW).

##### Ally and Rival Identities

#### Fateful Moments

No one decides to go adventuring without a reason. Some might set out from home in the name of vengeance, seeking retribution for themselves or their kin. Some might be looking for wealth or glory. Others might seek only a change from their dreary lives, never realizing that they’ll soon be caught up in events beyond their understanding along the open road.

Fateful moments are the turning points in your character’s life. The weight of these joyous or destructive occasions provided some of the talents, skills, and equipment you bring into your life as an adventurer. Roll once on the Fateful Moments table for each such moment you accrued in the previous section, courtesy of the allies and rivals that are part of your backstory.

If a fateful moment grants you a proficiency that you already had, choose any proficiency of the same type (armor, skill, language, tool, or weapon). If a fateful moment doesn’t make sense for your character (for example, if your siblings perished but you don’t have any siblings), roll a new event or work with your DM to change up the details. You can also forego rolling for fateful moments entirely, instead working with your DM to create moments specifically attuned to your character’s story.

15

You saved a pseudodragon from being eaten by a giant spider in a dark forest. The [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon) now loyally follows you wherever you go, even if you’d rather it stay hidden. It is controlled by the DM but obeys your commands if treated well.

16

You nearly died from a virulent disease (the DM’s choice of cackle fever, sewer plague, or sight rot; see [chapter 8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Diseases "chapter 8") of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")).

19

While reading through a mysterious tome once owned by your parent, you found a treasure map that points toward a place in [[Wildemount]] of the DM’s choice.

20

You received a letter revealing that you were the secret child of a wealthy noble family living in [[Rexxentrum]] within the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. They enclosed 100 gp to ensure your safe passage to the imperial capital, and a signet ring bearing your true family’s seal.

#### Favorite Food

Each region of [[Wildemount]] favors different cuisine based on climate and culture. Depending on where you grew up, you probably have a favorite local food. You can roll on the appropriate table for your homeland, or select or create a favorite option of your own.

**_Menagerie Coast._** The sea and the freewheeling culture of the [[Menagerie Coast]] makes its people favor seafood with bold spices, as well as drinks and salads with powerful fruity flavors. Indigenous ingredients have been married with Marquesian and Tal’Dorei recipes, creating a unique and vibrant culinary culture.

[[Clovis Concord|Concordian]] brewers are known for a potent and sweet brandy called silvertooth, distilled from the starchy palm lily root, and sweetened with fermented pineapple and sugarcane. Pirates favor rum, which is cheaper to produce. Tropical fruits and pods not used for brewing make luxurious desserts, and are eaten raw, cooked, dried, and baked into breads and cakes.

**_Western Wynandir._** The austere lifestyle of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the dour climate of its territories makes the people of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] favor hearty dishes made of root vegetables and red meat. Poorer households often eat feet, tongue, ears, and tripe, while the best cuts are reserved for noble tables. Imperial cuisine uses few spices, but still contains plenty of flavor from butter and herbs, or from fermentation.

Heavily fermented and pickled vegetables feature prominently in the cuisine of both rich and poor households alike. Wealthy imperial families drink imported wine, but the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] is best known for its potent spirits, distilled from root vegetables and enjoyed by rural folk.

**_Greying Wildlands._** Fresh game and foraged roots and berries are the primary food of the hunters of the [[Greying Wildlands]]. People who are particularly well connected within the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]] also enjoy exotic foods smuggled across the continent by [[the Myriad]].

Local drinks are made from fermented berries, but consumption of alcohol in the Wildlands was historically limited to ritual purposes. That changed with the arrival of [[the Myriad]], and the overconsumption of illicit alcohol is now seen as a symbol of status and wealth.

**_Eastern Wynandir._** Much of the territory of [[Xhorhas]] is wasteland, and the most edible plants in [[Eastern Wynandir]] are hearty tubers, roots, and grasses. The marshes and bogs of this land are also known for producing vast quantities of rice and cranberries. Most folk living here are hunters who band together to take down the mammoths and other massive beasts that roam the wastelands, one of which can provide enough food to feed a tribe for weeks.

The luxurious cuisine of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] court makes heavy use of mushrooms and rare meats found only in the dangerous caverns of the [[Underdark]]. The aboveground regions of [[Xhorhas]] are known for their fiery plum spirits, whereas working-class [[Dark Elves|drow]] traditionally drink an earthy, mushroom-based beer.

#### Mysterious Secret

You saw something you weren’t supposed to. A note came into your possession by mysterious means. A childhood friend spoke to you of a cryptic message. Whatever its source, a secret has haunted you your entire life. What is it? You can roll on the Mysterious Secrets table or work with your DM to create a secret.

d20

Secret

1

Years ago, my best friend came to me in the middle of the night and gave me a key that glowed with an icy blue light. I never saw that friend again.

2

I was the only witness to a cold-blooded murder. In the aftermath, I saw the killer take a gold coin with a ruby inlaid at its center from the victim’s body.

3

I once had a dream where an old stranger looked me dead in the eye, screamed “Scourger!” at the top of their lungs, and then exploded into a column of flame.

4

While exploring near my home, I found a cliff with a bunch of caverns dug out of it, all of them large enough for people to hide within.

5

I once saw a cat that seemed to be moving with a strange sense of purpose. I followed it to the dwelling of an important local elder, where it gazed through the window for an hour. Then it suddenly shook itself and raced away, as though a spell had been broken.

6

One of my parents left home in the middle of a storm, in the middle of the night. They had their sword and shield. They came back a week later, with the shield practically in pieces. They never talked about that night.

7

I had a friend who was a farmer. Every week, their crops doubled in size until they had pumpkins as big as houses. Then the next week, the friend was gone and their fields were torched. I never heard from them again.

8

I once saw an enormous figure walking through the clouds on a stormy night. At one point, they looked at me, and then kept walking.

9

I woke up one night to find one of my siblings perched on my chest, staring into my eyes. They said, “The time is soon,” and then giggled and ran off. When I asked them, they had no memory of the event.

10

I once saw a giant bird soar past overhead. It croaked out a cry that sounded like my name, then disappeared beyond the clouds.

11

I ate a fruit whose seeds spelled out a magic word where I’d cast them onto the ground. Years later, I saw the same word spelled out within a slice of bread.

12

A warrior friend of mine died. But every so often, I swear I see that friend in their old armor, at the corner of my vision.

13

An old seer once touched my forehead and gave me a vision of a flaming bird chained beneath a mountain, squirming and wailing in the darkness.

14

Once while on a boat, I heard a voice rumbling around me. I looked down below the water, and I swear I saw golden eyes looking up at me.

15

While I was eating, a whole potato exploded into worms, and I suffered a vision of a gigantic worm eating the world like a giant apple.

16

While picking flowers, I saw a tall figure with red skin and horns wandering the meadow. The flowers grew taller where they walked, but I fled in fear and never saw the figure again.

17

I was attacked by wolves in the woods one day, and was saved by a stranger with a bandage over their eyes. This person shone with silver light and was covered with scars—and I think I might have seen black wings tucked in at their back.

18

While trying to forge a sword, I accidentally burned myself with the red-hot blade. A strange vision then came to me, of powerful weapons calling out for me to wield them.

19

I once met someone fleeing through the woods who said they had escaped from some evil place. I asked what that meant, but the stranger fell dead on the spot. When I returned with help to collect the body, it was gone.

20

I once caught a falling star. It looked up from my hands and smiled, then told me to look for it on the day when fire erupts from the earth.

### Prophecy

A prophecy influences your character’s future.

Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met—for good or for ill.

One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don’t have to decide on all three goals at the start. You can choose your immediate goal now and think about the other two while you get a feel for the tone of the campaign.

These prophecy goals can help your character stay motivated, but they’ll also help your Dungeon Master create interesting stories that relate directly to your character. Your three prophecy goals can help the DM shape the campaign by determining what challenges or rewards to put in your character’s way. (If you rolled for a mysterious secret in the last section, that secret is a great thing to link to a goal.) Alternatively, you and your DM can work together to create goals that help link your character goals to an existing story the DM wants to tell.

Each time you complete a prophecy goal, your character gains a mechanical benefit as a reward.

If you’re looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn’t a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.

d20

Prophecy

1

I will defeat the creature that killed my parents. Its defeat might make me question my purpose in life.

2

I will uncover the reason that the [[Cerberus Assembly]] took my sibling away. Finding my sibling will set political events beyond my control into motion.

3

I will save my village from the [[Gnolls|gnoll]] tribe that has raided us for the past year. Their defeat will inspire me to perform even greater feats of heroism.

4

I will unlock the secrets of [[consecution]] that the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] are hiding. This knowledge will open my mind to a terrifying truth.

5

I will join a [[blood hunter]] order. My new comrades-in-arms will make me powerful, but I must pay a steep price for that power.

6

I will steal a king’s ransom from a [[The Revelry|Revelry]] pirate. That wealth will make me happy, but it will also draw unsavory characters to me.

7

I will become a hero of the war between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]]. I will be haunted by the atrocities I witness on the battlefield.

8

I will cleanse the [[Savalirwood]] of its corruption while welcoming that corruption into my own body.

9

I will infiltrate [[the Myriad]], but doing so will compel me to commit evil acts.

10

I will uncover a relic from [[Eiselcross]] and become famous, but the relic will exact a terrible cost.

11

I will speak to a [[dragon]], live to tell the tale, and provoke the [[dragon]]’s everlasting wrath.

12

I will steal a holy relic of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], making me a target for anyone who desires its power.

13

I will hesitate at an important moment. Another person will suffer for it.

14

I will stumble by accident into the arms of the [[Golden Grin]]. Though I will reject their call at first, something will draw me back.

15

I will befriend a flying beast and ride it through the skies. Others will envy me for the bond I have with this creature.

16

I will kneel before Bright Queen [[Leylas Kryn]] without knowing who she is. This moment of uncertainty will lead to danger.

17

I will stand before Princess [[Suria Dwendal]] and briefly hold the fate of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] in my hand. I won’t realize the gravity of my decision until it is too late.

18

My actions will lead to the death of a marquis of the [[Clovis Concord]]. I will know exactly who killed them, but no one in power will believe me.

19

I will anger one of the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]]. As its members hunt me in retribution, others will suffer and I will pay the price.

20

I will meet my birth parents. Doing so reveals a secret about my birth that will change the way I look at the world.

#### For the Dungeon Master

If you’re the Dungeon Master for your group, think about how long you want your campaign to run. Each of the players will have three goals set down for their character, each of which needs to be achieved by the end of the campaign. If you take the number of game sessions you anticipate your campaign lasting and divide it by the number of prophecy goals laid down by all your players, you’ll have the average number of sessions it should take for one player to complete one goal.

If the characters are completing their goals too quickly, remember that it’s more interesting for the players if events that are important to them happen more frequently than if they have to slog through a story that has nothing to do with them. Use your best judgment and find the pacing that works for you.

#### Prophecy Rewards

Each time a character completes one of their three prophecy goals, they gain a reward of the DM’s determination. Any of the following rewards are suitable for completing a goal, or the DM might decide on unique rewards of the same general level:

-   For the next 1d10 days, the character gains inspiration whenever they finish a long rest.
-   For the next 1d10 days, the character has advantage on saving throws to avoid being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened).
-   For the next 1d4 days, the character’s weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type.

## Backgrounds

This section presents two new [[backgrounds]]—the [[Grinner]] and the [[Volstrucker Agent]]—as well as suggestions for adapting some of the [[backgrounds]] from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") to tie them more closely to the factions of [[Wildemount]].

[[Wildemount]] is a land of secrets, so your character’s background might work best if it’s kept secret from the other players—especially if you choose either the [[Grinner]] or [[Volstrucker Agent]] background. Work with your DM to determine a second false background that can help hide your true background, or a cover background that can be used if your true background involves a secret identity.

### Grinner

The [[Golden Grin]] began in the far-off land of Tal’Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king’s authoritarian rule. Today, Tal’Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the [[Menagerie Coast]] and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the [[Clovis Concord]], from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

You are a [[Grinner]]. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed.

**Skill Proficiencies:** [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception), [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Performance)

**Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument, thieves’ tools

**Equipment:** A set of fine clothes, a disguise kit, a musical instrument of your choice, a gold-plated ring depicting a smiling face, and a pouch containing 15 gp

#### Favorite Code-Song

All members of the [[Golden Grin]] have learned a handful of folk songs in their travels, and use those songs to send secret codes and alert fellow Grinners to danger. Choose a favorite song or roll on the Favorite Code-Songs table.

Dr Dranzel, the [[Grinner]]

d6

Favorite Code-Song

1

_Zan’s Comin’ Back_. This hopeful Tal’Dorei folk song declares the inevitable return of a just ruler. Use it to seek out potential allies.

2

_Blow Fire Down the Coast_. A rowdy fighting song from the [[Clovis Concord]], this ditty talks of blasting up pirate ships. Use it to encourage battle.

3

_Hush! Onward Come the Dragons_. This Tal’Dorei folk song recounts the terror in the days after the invasion of the red [[dragon]] called the Cinder King. Use it to encourage caution in speech and deed.

4

_Let the Sword Grow Rust_. An antiwar anthem from [[Marquet]], this song has uncertain origins. Use it to help quell violent encounters.

5

_Drink Deep, Li’l Hummingbird_. A drinking rondo from the [[Menagerie Coast]], this song tells the tale of a young person who drinks so heavily that they awaken to find they’ve stowed away on a ship. Use it to encourage alertness in social situations.

6

_Dirge for the Emerald Fire_. This elven song supposedly has thousands of obscure verses. Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat.

#### Feature: Ballad of the Grinning Fool

Like every [[Grinner]], you know how to find a hideout. In any city of 10,000 people or more on the [[Menagerie Coast]] or in the lands of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], you can play the “Ballad of the Grinning Fool” in a major tavern or inn. A member of the [[Golden Grin]] will find you and give shelter to you and any companions you vouch for. This shelter might be discontinued if it becomes too dangerous to hide you, at the DM’s discretion.

This feature must be used with caution, for not all who know the ballad are your friends. Some are traitors, counterspies, or agents of tyranny.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Grinners are trained in the art of secrecy and innuendo, and are skilled at hiding in plain sight by being the loudest and brightest person in the room. Their skills in subterfuge and combat lend themselves well to an adventuring lifestyle, and traveling with mercenaries and treasure hunters creates a convenient excuse to journey through lands bent under tyranny.

6

### Volstrucker Agent

The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as “scourgers” by residents of large [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] cities such as [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]].

You are a [[Volstrucker agent]]. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of [[Bertrand Dwendal|King Dwendal]]—and more importantly, the will of the [[Cerberus Assembly|Assembly]].

**Skill Proficiencies:** [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception), [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)

**Tool Proficiencies:** Poisoner’s kit

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a black cloak with a hood, a poisoner’s kit, and a pouch containing 10 gp

#### Tragedy

Happy people aren’t selected to join the Volstrucker. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy—in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.

d6

Tragedy

1

**Familicide.** Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family.

2

**Amnesia.** You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past.

3

**Capture.** You were captured and tortured by agents of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], and barely escaped.

4

**Starvation.** A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely.

5

**Disfigurement.** One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day.

6

**Vicissitude.** You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye.

#### Feature: Shadow Network

You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.

The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a [[Volstrucker agent]]’s assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order—but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.

Personality Trait

I prefer to keep my thoughts to myself.

The job is all that matters. I will see it through.

My orders are important, but my comrades are worth more than anything. I would die for them.

Everything I’ve done, I’ve done to protect someone close to me.

If the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] falls, all of civilization falls with it. I will hold back chaos and barbarism at any cost.

Flaw

1

I drink to dull the pain in the back of my head.

2

I go a bit mad when I see blood.

3

I can hear the voices of everyone I’ve killed. I see their faces. I can’t be free of these ghosts.

4

Fear is a powerful motivator. I will do whatever it takes to prevent those who know what I am from seeing me fail, and from those I care about from knowing what I am.

### Adapting Backgrounds

All the [[backgrounds]] from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") fit perfectly into [[Wildemount]]. Additionally, though, a number of existing [[backgrounds]] can be adapted to represent specific factions in the campaign.

#### Acolyte (Luxonborn)

Every acolyte is a servant of some god. But you serve [[the Luxon]], a being that you believe transcends godhood and created the cosmos. No mere priest, you are a student of potential, for [[the Luxon]] is potentiality incarnate. Your Shelter of the Faithful feature applies to all who venerate [[the Luxon]], and to all who practice the art of [[dunamancy]] that [[the Luxon]] bestowed upon the world.

#### Criminal (Myriad Operative)

Most criminals in [[Wildemount]] are petty thieves and cutpurses who operate out of desperation. You, however, are a criminal of a higher caliber. You are a member of [[the Myriad]], the greatest crime syndicate to ever grace the face of [[Exandria]]. You have a network of criminal contacts and allies to help you in your crimes—but you also have rivals and superiors that would gladly throw you to the wolves to save their own skins.

[[The Myriad]] has bases of operation in every major city outside [[Eastern Wynandir]], even if those bases are made up of only two or three members. Wherever you find [[the Myriad]], you can find temporary shelter from the law—for a price.

#### Sailor (Revelry Pirate)

It seems that just about everyone is a sailor on the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Plenty of pirates ply the waters of the coast as well, but none are as infamous or as organized as the mighty [[The Revelry|Revelry]]. If you’re a pirate of [[the Revelry]], you serve [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]] and return a cut of all your plunder to him on the island of [[Darktow]].

[[The Revelry]] doesn’t take kindly to traitors and deserters, so if you count yourself a former member of that crew, you’ll want to watch your back while traveling on the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Thugs might hassle you and your allies until you even the score with [[the Revelry]], either by paying up, submitting to imprisonment, or proving that you’re too dangerous to tangle with.

#### Sage (Cobalt Scholar)

The [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] is an organization of monastic scholars dedicated to preserving knowledge and recorded history, not just across [[Wildemount]] but all of [[Exandria]]. Its operations are primarily based out of the cities of [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]] in the [[Dwendalian Empire]], and you likely studied at one of those sites.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-23.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/04-23.png)

[[Volstrucker Agent]]

As a rank-and-file pupil of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]], you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM’s permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. [[Expositors]] are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]]’s many Archives. Monks of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history.

#### Spy (Augen Trust)

Little is known about the [[Augen Trust]], even within the court of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Only one person knows all the members of this elite network of imperial spies: its leader, [[Oliver Schreiber]], a noble [[Gnomes|gnome]] with the ear of [[Bertrand Dwendal|King Dwendal]].

If you were favored with membership in the [[Augen Trust]], your entire life was laid bare before the secret spymaster at one point, and you were found to be a loyal servant of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] with a particular set of skills. Betraying the Trust is high treason against [[Bertrand Dwendal|the crown]], and defectors are hunted down and quickly slain.

Most defectors from the [[Augen Trust]] flee to the [[Biting North]], beyond the reach of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The [[Clovis Concord]] would extradite traitors in a heartbeat to maintain diplomatic relations with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and fleeing to [[Xhorhas]] is tantamount to suicide in the present political climate.

If you are a member of the Trust going on adventures, you are either a traitor who has somehow managed to keep your true identity secret from the greatest spies in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]—or you are still on active duty. In the latter case, you can work with your DM to figure out why you are traveling with outside adventurers.
