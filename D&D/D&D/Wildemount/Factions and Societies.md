> Queens, kings, emperors, nobles … beneath the rhetoric, it’s all the same. They say they fight to protect your families. They say they fight to enforce your beliefs, your honor. Fight for a better tomorrow. Fight for virtue, for prosperity. Bottom line, it’s all about fighting, and it’s you that dies fighting for their cause.

[[Wildemount]] is shaped by the ideals and interests of its factions, from powerful governments to covert societies. This war-torn continent is a fertile landscape for adventurers on a quest for greatness.

While this chapter outlines the major players across the continent operating in ways that directly affect the political landscape of [[Wildemount]], there are numerous smaller factions that can be introduced in your own [[Wildemount]] campaigns.

These may operate on their own or within larger factions, providing challenges, villains, and an element of chaos that can make your [[Wildemount]] campaign unique.

Below are a few examples of cults deeply rooted throughout [[Wildemount]], and their respective goals.
