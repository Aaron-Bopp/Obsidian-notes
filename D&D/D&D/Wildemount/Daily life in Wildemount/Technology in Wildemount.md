### Technology in [[Wildemount]]
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Customs/Wildemount
**Location**:: [[Daily Life in Wildemount]]

The level of technology in [[Wildemount]] is generally consistent with the technologies found in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook"). However, Dwendalian scientists in [[Hupperdook]] and [[Clovis Concord|Concordian]] tinkerers in [[Port Zoon]] have made incredible advances in black powder technology. Cannons, mobile war engines, and even handheld pistols and muskets have begun to be used as weapons of war.

Black powder weapons are not common, nor are they available to the general public. Only military engineers and special regiments within the Dwendalian armies and the [[Clovis Concord|Concordian]] navy have access to these powerful weapons, though some aspects of these designs are now finding their way into the Xhorhasian military. Statistics for weapons such as black powder barrels, pistols, and rifles are provided in [chapter 9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Firearms "chapter 9") of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide"). All items listed as “Renaissance Items” on the Firearms and Explosives tables exist in some form in [[Wildemount]]. Since these items can’t be purchased in a normal store, characters can only obtain them through theft, military service, or a quest of your own devising.
