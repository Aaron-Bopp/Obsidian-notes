### Currency in [[Wildemount]]

The nations of [[Wildemount]] all mint their own coins, and though some slight regional differences exist between currencies, all regions readily accept gold, silver, and copper coins. Spending money of Dwendalian mint in the [[Kryn Dynasty]] might turn heads, but a gold coin is still a gold coin.

Platinum and electrum coins are rarely minted by modern nations, but enough of both of these currencies survived the [[Age of Arcanum]] that both are considered valid tender across the land.
