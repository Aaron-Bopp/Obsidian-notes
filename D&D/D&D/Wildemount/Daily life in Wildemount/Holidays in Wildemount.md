**Location**:: [[Daily Life in Wildemount]]

The different nations of [[Wildemount]] celebrate different holidays, though some of the gods’ holy days are consistent across the land. Notably, the [[Dwendalian Empire]] has banned the worship of certain gods within its borders, and thus only celebrates the holidays of legal gods. These holy days are listed in [[Pantheon of Exandria]], along with the gods they celebrate.

Holidays unrelated to the gods celebrated across the continent in some form include:

**Zenith.** Summer begins at high noon on the 26th of Unndilar and is celebrated with games, displays of magic, and black powder fireworks.

**Harvest’s Close.** Autumn begins on the 3rd of Fessuran and is typically celebrated with feasting in rural regions and with carnivals in the cities.

**Barren Eve.** Winter’s longest night, the 2nd of Duscar, is a day of mourning for those lost in war. Come victory or ruin in the war between the Dwendalians and the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], countless candles will be lit on the next Barren Eve.
