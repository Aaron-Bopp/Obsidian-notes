## Volstrucker Agent

The Volstrucker are a clandestine organization of arcane assassins and enforcers in the service of the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. Their operatives bear no official title, but are referred to in hushed tones as “scourgers” by residents of large Dwendalian cities such as [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]].

You are a Volstrucker agent. Your duty is to silence dissidents who would undermine the will of King Dwendal—and more importantly, the will of the Assembly.

**Skill Proficiencies:** [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Deception), [Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)

**Tool Proficiencies:** Poisoner’s kit

**Languages:** One of your choice

**Equipment:** A set of common clothes, a black cloak with a hood, a poisoner’s kit, and a pouch containing 10 gp

### Tragedy

Happy people aren’t selected to join the Volstrucker. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] preys upon talented individuals who have been broken by tragedy—in some cases, tragedy that the Volstrucker has arranged for. A slightly broken mind is more easily reshaped and reeducated. Choose the tragedy that set you on this path, or roll on the Tragedies table.

|d6 |Tragedy|
| --- | --- |
| 1 |**Familicide.** Through deceit or manipulation, the Volstrucker convinced you to slaughter your own family. |
| 2 | **Amnesia.** You were forced to study magic so potent that it strained your mind beyond mortal limits, stealing away the memories of your past. |
| 3 | **Capture.** You were captured and tortured by agents of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], and barely escaped. |
| 4 | **Starvation.** A terrible blight afflicted your rural village, and many of your friends and family members starved to death. You survived, but only barely. |
| 5 | **Disfigurement.** One of your arcane experiments went wrong and scarred or dismembered you so gravely that others now shun you. Only the Volstrucker showed you kindness after that day. |
| 6 | **Vicissitude.** You were once the scion of a wealthy family who lost their entire fortune in the blink of an eye. |


### Feature: Shadow Network 
You have access to the Volstrucker shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you write a letter in a special arcane ink, address it to a member of the Volstrucker, and cast it into a fire, the letter will burn to cinders and materialize whole again on the person of the agent you addressed it to.

The ink used to send a letter across the shadow network is the same as that used by a wizard to scribe spells in a spellbook. Writing a letter in this ink costs 10 gp per page.

### Suggested Characteristics

Agents of the Volstrucker are groomed to follow orders without question and to kill without mercy. The trauma that brings one into the order can fester even more strongly against the darkness of a Volstrucker agent’s assignments. Officially, no one ever leaves the order—but those desperate enough do whatever it takes to gain some measure of freedom.
