## Adapting [[Backgrounds]]

All the [[backgrounds]] from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") fit perfectly into [[Wildemount]]. Additionally, though, a number of existing [[backgrounds]] can be adapted to represent specific factions in the campaign.

### Acolyte (Luxonborn)

Every acolyte is a servant of some god. But you serve [[the Luxon]], a being that you believe transcends godhood and created the cosmos. No mere priest, you are a student of potential, for [[the Luxon]] is potentiality incarnate. Your Shelter of the Faithful feature applies to all who venerate [[the Luxon]], and to all who practice the art of [[dunamancy]] that [[the Luxon]] bestowed upon the world.

### Criminal ([[The Myriad|Myriad]] Operative)

Most criminals in [[Wildemount]] are petty thieves and cutpurses who operate out of desperation. You, however, are a criminal of a higher caliber. You are a member of [[the Myriad]], the greatest crime syndicate to ever grace the face of [[Exandria]]. You have a network of criminal contacts and allies to help you in your crimes—but you also have rivals and superiors that would gladly throw you to the wolves to save their own skins.

[[The Myriad]] has bases of operation in every major city outside [[Eastern Wynandir]], even if those bases are made up of only two or three members. Wherever you find [[the Myriad]], you can find temporary shelter from the law—for a price.

### Sailor ([[The Revelry|Revelry]] Pirate)

It seems that just about everyone is a sailor on the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Plenty of pirates ply the waters of the coast as well, but none are as infamous or as organized as the mighty [[The Revelry|Revelry]]. If you’re a pirate of [[the Revelry]], you serve the Plank King and return a cut of all your plunder to him on the island of [[Darktow]].

[[The Revelry]] doesn’t take kindly to traitors and deserters, so if you count yourself a former member of that crew, you’ll want to watch your back while traveling on the [[Menagerie Coast]]. Thugs might hassle you and your allies until you even the score with [[the Revelry]], either by paying up, submitting to imprisonment, or proving that you’re too dangerous to tangle with.

### Sage (Cobalt Scholar)

The [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] is an organization of monastic scholars dedicated to preserving knowledge and recorded history, not just across [[Wildemount]] but all of [[Exandria]]. Its operations are primarily based out of the cities of [[Zadash]] and [[Rexxentrum]] in the [[Dwendalian Empire]], and you likely studied at one of those sites.

[[Volstrucker Agent]]

As a rank-and-file pupil of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]], you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM’s permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. [[Expositors]] are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]]’s many Archives. Monks of the [[Library of the Cobalt Soul|Cobalt Soul]] are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history.

### Spy ([[Augen Trust]])

Little is known about the [[Augen Trust]], even within the court of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Only one person knows all the members of this elite network of imperial spies: its leader, [[Oliver Schreiber]], a noble [[Gnomes|gnome]] with the ear of [[Bertrand Dwendal|King Dwendal]].

If you were favored with membership in the [[Augen Trust]], your entire life was laid bare before the secret spymaster at one point, and you were found to be a loyal servant of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] with a particular set of skills. Betraying the Trust is high treason against [[Bertrand Dwendal|the crown]], and defectors are hunted down and quickly slain.

Most defectors from the [[Augen Trust]] flee to the [[Biting North]], beyond the reach of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. The [[Clovis Concord]] would extradite traitors in a heartbeat to maintain diplomatic relations with the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], and fleeing to [[Xhorhas]] is tantamount to suicide in the present political climate.

If you are a member of the Trust going on adventures, you are either a traitor who has somehow managed to keep your true identity secret from the greatest spies in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]—or you are still on active duty. In the latter case, you can work with your DM to figure out why you are traveling with outside adventurers.
