# Backgrounds

This section presents two new backgrounds—the [[Grinner]] and the [[Volstrucker Agent]]—as well as suggestions for adapting some of the backgrounds from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") to tie them more closely to the factions of [[Wildemount]].

[[Wildemount]] is a land of secrets, so your character’s background might work best if it’s kept secret from the other players—especially if you choose either the [[Grinner]] or [[Volstrucker Agent]] background. Work with your DM to determine a second false background that can help hide your true background, or a cover background that can be used if your true background involves a secret identity.
