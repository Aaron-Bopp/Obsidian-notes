# Heroic Chronicle

The heroic chronicle is a system that allows players and Dungeon Masters to work together to build a compelling character story. It even allows characters to gain additional proficiencies, magic items, spells, or feats before the campaign begins. This section assumes that the player is starting from scratch—without having chosen a race, class, or background for their character. The events that occur as a result of these random rolls inform what kind of character the player has. A player who already has a character concept in mind can choose options from the tables instead of rolling randomly, ignoring anything that doesn’t fit their character concept. If you’re a player using these tables, don’t be surprised if creating a backstory inspires you to change some aspect of your character concept. Let this tool inspire your imagination rather than limit it.

The “Backstory” section of the chronicle roots a character’s history in the land of Wildemount by helping the player determine the character’s nation, home settlement, and relationships with family members, allies, and rivals. It helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began. Options for determining a character’s favorite food and mysterious secrets can help further define a character’s relationship to their homeland and the other party members.

The “Prophecy” section of the chronicle sets out three aspirations or goals that the player has for their character. Prophecy goals can help players and DMs create engaging stories that make the game more interesting. Each time a goal is met, it takes on a prophetic tone as a character achieves something they were driven or destined to do. Completing a prophecy goal grants the character a mechanical benefit as a reward.

Dungeon Masters can also use the heroic chronicle process to generate villains with histories and motivations grounded in the dangerous lands of Wildemount.

### Backstory

A character’s story begins with determining the region where they were born, the job they had before becoming an adventurer, their social status, the settlement where they grew up, and their family relationships. As this backstory develops, the character will gain allies and rivals, as well as learn some of the fateful moments that set them on the path of adventure.

#### Homeland

The known lands of Wildemount are divided into four major geographic regions, each of which is described in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "chapter 3"). From west to east, these regions are the Menagerie Coast, Western Wynandir (which is further divided into the Marrow Valley and the Zemni Fields), the Greying Wildlands, and Eastern Wynandir. The northernmost reaches of the continent—the forgotten lands of Eiselcross—are not included in this section.

Roll a d100 and consult the Homelands table to determine which region you were born in. If you were born in one region but grew up in another, roll twice on the table to determine your place of birth and the region you eventually settled in.

##### Homelands

| d100  | Region (Government)                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01–21 | Menagerie Coast (choose either the Clovis Concord or Revelry pirates)          |
| 22–40 | Marrow Valley in Western Wynandir (Dwendalian Empire)                          |
| 41–72 | Zemni Fields in Western Wynandir (Dwendalian Empire)                           |
| 73–77 | Greying Wildlands (choose either the Tribes of Shadycreek Run or Uthodurn)     |
| 78–00 | Xhorhas in Eastern Wynandir (choose either the Kryn Dynasty or Xarzith Kitril) |

#### Background

In addition to granting you items, gold, and proficiencies, your background gives you a sense of belonging in the world. You can roll on the Backgrounds table to randomly determine your character’s background, or you can choose one that fits your character concept. This table includes new backgrounds and adapted backgrounds from this book (EGW) as well as the backgrounds from the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") (PH). New and adapted backgrounds are described later in this chapter.

Your background determines your place in the world. Within the strict hierarchy of the Dwendalian Empire, a family with a poor social status is worth less than the soil they till, while a family of great renown enjoys all the privileges of high society. Most folk toil in the same profession from the day they’re old enough to work until the day they die, and few families ever rise to glory from obscurity. That’s just the way of things.

You, however, are an adventurer. Though your social status is determined by your background and your country of origin, you have the power to rebel against the hierarchies of your land and change your fate. Your background doesn’t change, nor do the proficiencies and other benefits you gain because of it. But the social status associated with your background might shift over the course of your backstory—and over the course of your adventures.

Each nation in Wildemount views people’s backgrounds according to its cultural values. Based on your character’s background, think about your social status within the context of the details of your homeland presented below. Then use the Social Status Relationships table to determine how many allies and rivals you’ll roll for later on in this section.

**_Menagerie Coast._** Both the Clovis Concord and their hated nemesis, the Revelry pirates, prize personal freedom over all other things. The Revelry simply takes this ideology one bloody step further. People of the Concord celebrate folk heroes and entertainers, and all other people who might become celebrities, iconoclasts, and figures of legend.

At the same time, the common working-class sailor is a symbol of the Concord’s strength. As with the crew of a well-run ship, the small actions of individuals can have a huge impact when all are working toward common goals. Common sailors despise the Revelry, and noteworthy sailors might even have a rival within the Revelry.

**_Western Wynandir._** The Dwendalian Empire prizes king and country over personal freedoms—at least as far as the freedoms of the poor are concerned. For the wealthy noble class, most laws are mere guidelines, since bribery and political favors can make almost any problem go away.

In the Dwendalian Empire, rural folk are seen as honest, hardworking, and pious, while the wealthy ruling class are viewed as beneficent patricians—or as miserly tyrants. Patriotism is a core virtue, and enlisting in the Righteous Brand and adhering to the empire’s strict religious laws are the most patriotic acts of all.

**_Greying Wildlands._** The Greying Wildlands and the settlement of Shadycreek Run are lawless. Crime is a virtue here, mercy a vice. Only strength rules in the land run by the coalition of criminals known as “the Tribes.” Anyone who doesn’t have the personal strength to defend themself is treated with contempt, and those who represent the iron fist of the empire are utterly despised.

Travel farther north, however, and one reaches the Diarchy of Uthodurn, a stable and ancient city ruled by elves and dwarves. Here, order and art are prized over chaos and personal enrichment. If your character is from Uthodurn rather than Shadycreek Run, replace any rival you gain from the Social Status Relationships table with an ally, and vice-versa.

**_Eastern Wynandir._** Accumulating knowledge and achieving spiritual enlightenment are the virtues of the Kryn Dynasty, whose society is built around the tenets of the Luxon. Artists, entertainers, artisans, and all people who create are well-valued in Kryn society. Yet in this age of war, people whose skills allow them to destroy are paradoxically prized just as highly.

To the Kryn, a person’s background is less important than the experiences they’ve accumulated—particularly for those who have begun walking the sacred path known as consecution. Nonetheless, even the most enlightened society can’t help but look down upon its lowest citizens and sneer at its haughty elite. Once all beings are beloved by the Luxon, perhaps these ills of society will be purged once and for all.

#### Home Settlement

Once you’ve determined your nation and considered your social status within that realm, roll on the appropriate table in this section to determine which settlement you grew up in. If your character is a traveler—a child of soldiers, a nomad, a traveling performer, and so forth—you can roll for up to three settlements that you’ve visited often and have some connections in.

Each home settlement is detailed in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "chapter 3"). If your home settlement doesn’t make sense for your social status, you can either roll for a different settlement or think about ways to make a contradiction work for your backstory. For example, if you have the Noble background but rolled a village as a home settlement, perhaps you were raised there to protect you from your family’s enemies.

| 97–00 | Xarzith Kitril        | City             |
#### Race

You can determine your character’s race by consulting the section for your home settlement in [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "chapter 3"). Each settlement’s description includes a percentile breakdown of its racial demographics. You can roll a d100 to determine your character’s race, or simply choose whichever race you wish to play. If your roll indicates “other races,” you can choose any race that isn’t already represented in the settlement’s demographics.

#### Family

The size of your home settlement plays a part in the size of your family. Villages in Wildemount are predominantly rural, and families need children to tend their farms and perform household duties. By contrast, land and commodities are expensive in the cities, making it difficult for many people to afford a large family.

Families with at least three children often encourage one child, typically the eldest, to continue the family trade. The other children are encouraged to travel so as to learn a new trade, become a scholar, become apprenticed to a master guild artisan, or similar activities. Imperial families who can afford to do so might even send one or more children to Rexxentrum, where they can learn magic at the Soltryce Academy.

Roll twice on the appropriate Family Size table—once to determine how many living parents you have, and once to determine your living siblings. The state of your family might change over the course of your backstory, just as it might change over the course of the campaign.

| d100  | Number of Parents | Number of Siblings |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 01–10 | 3 or more         | 2d4 + 2            |
| 11–50 | 2                 | 2d4                |
| 51–89 | 1                 | 1d4                |
| 90–00 | 0                 | 0                  |


| d100  | Number of Parents | Number of Siblings |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 01–05 | 3 or more         | 2d4 + 2            |
| 06–60 | 2                 | 2d4                |
| 61–80 | 1                 | 1d4                |
| 81–00 | 0                 | 0                  |

**_Parents_**. You might have been blessed with two loving parents, or you might have helped your single parent take care of the rest of your family. You might have been raised by three or more parents, whether because those parents engage in a polyamorous relationship, one or both parents had multiple spouses, or you were raised communally. Or you might have no parents, whether you were orphaned early in life or have outlived the parents you did have.

**_Siblings._** Your siblings can include your parents’ other children, half-siblings from your parents’ other marriages or affairs, cousins who are as close as siblings, or beloved friends who became siblings by bond rather than by blood.

#### Family Member Traits

Once you’ve determined the size of your family, choose the gender and age of each family member.

#### Powerful Family Relationships

Even before your adventuring career began, you had allies who supported you and rivals who sought to thwart your success. In some cases, your allies might be so devoted that they are indispensable companions, while your rivals are hateful enough to make them nothing short of mortal enemies.

Your first allies and rivals are your family. Sometimes your family members are your closest friends. Sometimes you hate their guts. Roll a d3. This is the number of powerful relationships you have within your family.

Roll once on the Family Relationships table for each powerful relationship you have within your family, to determine the setup of your friendship or rivalry.

| d100   | Relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–10 | You thought you killed this family member, whether by accident or otherwise. You never expected to see them again—but now they’re out for your blood. You gain one rival.                                         |
| 11–20 | You insulted this family member so gravely that they left your life forever. If they ever return, it will be to settle the score. You gain one rival.                                                             |
| 21–30 | You have always been better than this family member at a particular activity. They grew jealous and abandoned you, so that they could return and best you one day. You gain one rival.                            |
| 31–40 | You uncovered a secret about this family member, whether a tiny embarrassment or a life-changing scandal. They now seek to unveil your darkest secret. You gain one rival.                                        |
| 41–50 | You and this family member have a friendly rivalry, and are constantly trying to best each other in an activity, craft, or other pursuit. You visit occasionally to test each other’s skills. You gain one rival. |
| 51–60 | This family member owes you a debt, and they don’t like it. They’ll help you out when you need it, but only to clear the slate. You gain one ally.                                                                |
| 61–70 | This family member loves you, but you were never that close. They’ll do anything to help you—as long as they won’t be at risk of injury or death. You gain one ally.                                              |
| 71–80 | This family member caused you to have a horrible accident when you were a child. They still feel incredible guilt, which they would do anything to assuage. You gain one ally.                                    |
| 81–90 | This family member left long ago for reasons you don’t understand or won’t talk about. Before they left, they promised you that they would return in your hour of greatest need. You gain one ally.               |
| 91–00 | This family member has always loved you with all their heart, and would do anything for you. You gain one ally.                                                                                                   |

#### Acquired Allies and Rivals

If you gained allies or rivals based on your background and your homeland, this section allows you to establish your relationship with those allies and rivals, as well as the broad strokes of their identities. Start by rolling once on the Ally Relationships or Rival Relationships table for each of those allies and rivals. Alternatively, you and your DM can work together to create ally or rival relationships that enhance your character’s story.

When you’ve determined the relationships between you and your acquired allies and rivals, roll for each one on the Ally and Rival Identities table to determine their game statistics. This table includes monsters and NPCs in this book (EGW) and in the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_ (MM).

If you roll a particularly powerful ally or rival on this table, their involvement in your life causes a fateful moment to occur in your backstory, as determined in the next section.

| d100  | Relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01–10 | This ally is a loyal pet. Rather than rolling on the Ally and Rival Identities table, choose one beast of CR 1/8 or lower as your pet.                                                                           |
| 11–20 | This person once lost a bet to you and is still trying to scrounge up the cash to pay you back. They’ve decided you’d both be better off if they put you in their debt instead.                                  |
| 21–30 | This person was once a beggar to whom you gave a large sum of money. They have transformed their life thanks to you, and now want to repay your generosity.                                                      |
| 31–40 | You were this person’s favorite drinking buddy, and their home is always open to you and your friends.                                                                                                           |
| 41–50 | This person was once your mentor, but you left before you could complete your training. You are welcome to return and finish what you started, but only when you are ready.                                      |
| 51–60 | You bonded with this person over a traumatic event such as a battle or an armed robbery. If you ever tell them that you are in danger, they will try to aid you.                                                 |
| 61–70 | You and this person share a terrible secret, and you have sworn to never reveal it to anyone. They will help you keep this secret if it is ever in danger of being revealed.                                     |
| 71–80 | This person fell in love with you. If you reciprocated, they always stand at your side. If you didn’t, they took it well, and still consider you their closest friend.                                           |
| 81–90 | You and this person were affected by powerful magic, and now you both share a telepathic connection that functions while you are within 1 mile of each other.                                                    |
| 91–00 | This person owes you their life. Even if they can’t follow you everywhere you go, they will do anything they can to protect you.                                                                                 |

| d100  | Relationship                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 01–10 | This person believes that you murdered their sibling. Regardless of your guilt or innocence, they are out for your blood.                                                                                        |     |
| 11–20 | You bested this person in combat, but they believe you cheated to defeat them. They long to prove that they are the superior warrior.                                                                            |     |
| 21–30 | You broke a promise to this person, and it caused them to suffer greatly. Now they conspire to make someone else break a valuable promise to you.                                                                |     |

**_Secret Identities._** Some of these allies and rivals might keep their true identity secret from your character. The DM can decide to make one or more of the rolls on the Ally and Rival Identities table to keep the secret intact. Stat blocks appear in either appendix B of the _[Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")_ (MM) or [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary "chapter 7") of this book (EGW).

##### Ally and Rival Identities

#### Fateful Moments

No one decides to go adventuring without a reason. Some might set out from home in the name of vengeance, seeking retribution for themselves or their kin. Some might be looking for wealth or glory. Others might seek only a change from their dreary lives, never realizing that they’ll soon be caught up in events beyond their understanding along the open road.

Fateful moments are the turning points in your character’s life. The weight of these joyous or destructive occasions provided some of the talents, skills, and equipment you bring into your life as an adventurer. Roll once on the Fateful Moments table for each such moment you accrued in the previous section, courtesy of the allies and rivals that are part of your backstory.

If a fateful moment grants you a proficiency that you already had, choose any proficiency of the same type (armor, skill, language, tool, or weapon). If a fateful moment doesn’t make sense for your character (for example, if your siblings perished but you don’t have any siblings), roll a new event or work with your DM to change up the details. You can also forego rolling for fateful moments entirely, instead working with your DM to create moments specifically attuned to your character’s story.

The [pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pseudodragon) now loyally follows you wherever you go, even if you’d rather it stay hidden.

#### Favorite Food

Each region of Wildemount favors different cuisine based on climate and culture. Depending on where you grew up, you probably have a favorite local food. You can roll on the appropriate table for your homeland, or select or create a favorite option of your own.

**_Menagerie Coast._** The sea and the freewheeling culture of the Menagerie Coast makes its people favor seafood with bold spices, as well as drinks and salads with powerful fruity flavors. Indigenous ingredients have been married with Marquesian and Tal’Dorei recipes, creating a unique and vibrant culinary culture.

Concordian brewers are known for a potent and sweet brandy called silvertooth, distilled from the starchy palm lily root, and sweetened with fermented pineapple and sugarcane. Pirates favor rum, which is cheaper to produce. Tropical fruits and pods not used for brewing make luxurious desserts, and are eaten raw, cooked, dried, and baked into breads and cakes.

**_Western Wynandir._** The austere lifestyle of the Dwendalian Empire and the dour climate of its territories makes the people of the empire favor hearty dishes made of root vegetables and red meat. Poorer households often eat feet, tongue, ears, and tripe, while the best cuts are reserved for noble tables. Imperial cuisine uses few spices, but still contains plenty of flavor from butter and herbs, or from fermentation.

Heavily fermented and pickled vegetables feature prominently in the cuisine of both rich and poor households alike. Wealthy imperial families drink imported wine, but the empire is best known for its potent spirits, distilled from root vegetables and enjoyed by rural folk.

**_Greying Wildlands._** Fresh game and foraged roots and berries are the primary food of the hunters of the Greying Wildlands. People who are particularly well connected within the Tribes of Shadycreek Run also enjoy exotic foods smuggled across the continent by the Myriad.

Local drinks are made from fermented berries, but consumption of alcohol in the Wildlands was historically limited to ritual purposes. That changed with the arrival of the Myriad, and the overconsumption of illicit alcohol is now seen as a symbol of status and wealth.

**_Eastern Wynandir._** Much of the territory of Xhorhas is wasteland, and the most edible plants in Eastern Wynandir are hearty tubers, roots, and grasses. The marshes and bogs of this land are also known for producing vast quantities of rice and cranberries. Most folk living here are hunters who band together to take down the mammoths and other massive beasts that roam the wastelands, one of which can provide enough food to feed a tribe for weeks.

The luxurious cuisine of the Kryn court makes heavy use of mushrooms and rare meats found only in the dangerous caverns of the Underdark. The aboveground regions of Xhorhas are known for their fiery plum spirits, whereas working-class drow traditionally drink an earthy, mushroom-based beer.

#### Mysterious Secret

You saw something you weren’t supposed to. A note came into your possession by mysterious means. A childhood friend spoke to you of a cryptic message. Whatever its source, a secret has haunted you your entire life. What is it? You can roll on the Mysterious Secrets table or work with your DM to create a secret.

| 1   | Years ago, my best friend came to me in the middle of the night and gave me a key that glowed with an icy blue light. I never saw that friend again.                                                                                                                  |
| 2   | I was the only witness to a cold-blooded murder. In the aftermath, I saw the killer take a gold coin with a ruby inlaid at its center from the victim’s body.                                                                                                         |
| 3   | I once had a dream where an old stranger looked me dead in the eye, screamed “Scourger!” at the top of their lungs, and then exploded into a column of flame.                                                                                                         |
| 4   | While exploring near my home, I found a cliff with a bunch of caverns dug out of it, all of them large enough for people to hide within.                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | I once saw a cat that seemed to be moving with a strange sense of purpose. I followed it to the dwelling of an important local elder, where it gazed through the window for an hour. Then it suddenly shook itself and raced away, as though a spell had been broken. |
| 6   | One of my parents left home in the middle of a storm, in the middle of the night. They had their sword and shield. They came back a week later, with the shield practically in pieces. They never talked about that night.                                            |
| 7   | I had a friend who was a farmer. Every week, their crops doubled in size until they had pumpkins as big as houses. Then the next week, the friend was gone and their fields were torched. I never heard from them again.                                              |
| 8   | I once saw an enormous figure walking through the clouds on a stormy night. At one point, they looked at me, and then kept walking.                                                                                                                                   |
| 9   | I woke up one night to find one of my siblings perched on my chest, staring into my eyes. They said, “The time is soon,” and then giggled and ran off. When I asked them, they had no memory of the event.                                                            |
| 10  | I once saw a giant bird soar past overhead. It croaked out a cry that sounded like my name, then disappeared beyond the clouds.                                                                                                                                       |
| 11  | I ate a fruit whose seeds spelled out a magic word where I’d cast them onto the ground. Years later, I saw the same word spelled out within a slice of bread.                                                                                                         |
| 12  | A warrior friend of mine died. But every so often, I swear I see that friend in their old armor, at the corner of my vision.                                                                                                                                          |
| 13  | An old seer once touched my forehead and gave me a vision of a flaming bird chained beneath a mountain, squirming and wailing in the darkness.                                                                                                                        |
| 14  | Once while on a boat, I heard a voice rumbling around me. I looked down below the water, and I swear I saw golden eyes looking up at me.                                                                                                                              |
| 15  | While I was eating, a whole potato exploded into worms, and I suffered a vision of a gigantic worm eating the world like a giant apple.                                                                                                                               |
| 16  | While picking flowers, I saw a tall figure with red skin and horns wandering the meadow. The flowers grew taller where they walked, but I fled in fear and never saw the figure again.                                                                                |
| 17  | I was attacked by wolves in the woods one day, and was saved by a stranger with a bandage over their eyes. This person shone with silver light and was covered with scars—and I think I might have seen black wings tucked in at their back.                          |
| 18  | While trying to forge a sword, I accidentally burned myself with the red-hot blade. A strange vision then came to me, of powerful weapons calling out for me to wield them.                                                                                           |
| 19  | I once met someone fleeing through the woods who said they had escaped from some evil place. I asked what that meant, but the stranger fell dead on the spot. When I returned with help to collect the body, it was gone.                                             |
| 20  | I once caught a falling star. It looked up from my hands and smiled, then told me to look for it on the day when fire erupts from the earth.                                                                                                                          |

### Prophecy

A prophecy influences your character’s future.

Write down three aspirations or goals you have for your character, and which you want to achieve over the course of the campaign. A prophecy goal should have two parts. First is the goal that your character wants to attain. Second is a sense of what complication might ensue once the goal is met—for good or for ill.

One of your prophecy goals should be an immediate goal, one should be long term, and one should be a goal that concludes your character arc at the end of the campaign. You don’t have to decide on all three goals at the start. You can choose your immediate goal now and think about the other two while you get a feel for the tone of the campaign.

These prophecy goals can help your character stay motivated, but they’ll also help your Dungeon Master create interesting stories that relate directly to your character. Your three prophecy goals can help the DM shape the campaign by determining what challenges or rewards to put in your character’s way. (If you rolled for a mysterious secret in the last section, that secret is a great thing to link to a goal.) Alternatively, you and your DM can work together to create goals that help link your character goals to an existing story the DM wants to tell.

Each time you complete a prophecy goal, your character gains a mechanical benefit as a reward.

If you’re looking for prophecy goals for your character, you can roll on the Prophecy Inspirations table for a random goal and a consequence of that goal. If this goal isn’t a perfect fit for your character, you can fine-tune it or roll again to find one that works better.

#### For the Dungeon Master

If you’re the Dungeon Master for your group, think about how long you want your campaign to run. Each of the players will have three goals set down for their character, each of which needs to be achieved by the end of the campaign. If you take the number of game sessions you anticipate your campaign lasting and divide it by the number of prophecy goals laid down by all your players, you’ll have the average number of sessions it should take for one player to complete one goal.

If the characters are completing their goals too quickly, remember that it’s more interesting for the players if events that are important to them happen more frequently than if they have to slog through a story that has nothing to do with them. Use your best judgment and find the pacing that works for you.

#### Prophecy Rewards

Each time a character completes one of their three prophecy goals, they gain a reward of the DM’s determination. Any of the following rewards are suitable for completing a goal, or the DM might decide on unique rewards of the same general level:

-   For the next 1d10 days, the character gains inspiration whenever they finish a long rest.
-   For the next 1d10 days, the character has advantage on saving throws to avoid being [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened).
-   For the next 1d4 days, the character’s weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon’s type.
