## Goliaths

The goliaths of Exandria are a mighty people with stone giant blood running in their veins. Most stand well over seven feet tall and are blessed with a naturally powerful physique. Like their stone giant progenitors, goliaths are a rare sight in Wildemount. Most live on isolated peaks in the Cyrios Mountains, the Penumbra Range, and on the isolated land of Eiselcross. Those few goliaths who are exiled from their herds and wander into more densely peopled lands are uniformly greeted with fear and confusion.

Goliaths have a compulsion to compete and keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills. Above all else, they are driven to outdo their past efforts. Few goliaths reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past achievements.

Among goliaths, any adult who can’t or won’t contribute to the herd is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

_**Age.**_ Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.

_**Alignment.**_ Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self-sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.

_**Size.**_ Goliaths stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:

Height = 6 feet + 2 inches + your size modifier in inches

Weight in pounds = 200 + (2d6 × your size modifier)

_**Speed.**_ Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

_**Natural Athlete.**_ You have proficiency in the [Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics) skill.

_**Stone’s Endurance.**_ You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
