## Dragonborn

[[Wildemount]] was the cradle from which all dragonborn civilization grew. The city-state of [[Draconia]] rose in the [[Dreemoth Ravine]] along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during [[the Calamity]] forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of [[Xhorhas]]. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin.

Twenty years ago, [[Draconia]] was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the [[Dreemoth Ravine]]. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world.

### Dragonborn in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

The [[Dwendalian Empire]] has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of [[Draconia]]. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur.

Many ravenites have journeyed to the [[Dwendalian Empire]] in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the [[Cerberus Assembly]] not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of [[Talonstadt]] for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there.

### Dragonborn on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the [[Clovis Concord]]. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment.

Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the [[Menagerie Coast]] are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the [[Clovis Concord]] must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves.

### Dragonborn in [[Xhorhas]]

Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of [[Xhorhas]] in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of [[the Luxon]]’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.
