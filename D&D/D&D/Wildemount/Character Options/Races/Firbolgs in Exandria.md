## Firbolgs

Firbolgs are a forest-dwelling race native to the [[Greying Wildlands]], particularly the mysterious [[Savalirwood]]. Their bodies are covered with thick fur ranging from tones of earthen brown and ruddy red to cool grays and blues, and even to wild hues of pink and green. Their bodies are bovine or camelid in appearance, with floppy, pointed ears and broad, pink noses, but they are bipedal and have hands that can manipulate weapons and objects.

Most firbolgs live in extended family units, and it is unusual to find one living alone. However, they are introverted to the point where they seldom engage with other firbolgs outside the family unit, and firbolgs rarely form their own cities, villages, or even large tribes. Despite this, many firbolgs enjoy visiting other nations’ settlements for a short time for trade, sightseeing, and to visit friends.

### Firbolgs in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Most imperial citizens have never even heard of firbolgs. Stories involving these folk are rare, and typically liken them to the giants, depicting firbolgs as hulking humanoid warriors rather than fur-covered nature lovers. People living in the great crossroads city of [[Zadash]] might be familiar with one firbolg in particular: the jolly, eccentric enchanter known as Pumat Sol. This familiarity means that many warm quickly to new firbolgs, albeit after some initial surprise.

### Firbolgs on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Since firbolgs are neither prone to travel nor native to the [[Menagerie Coast]], their numbers along [[Wildemount]]’s western shores are vanishingly small. The people of the [[Clovis Concord]] share the same folk tales of giant-like humanoid firbolgs as the folk of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], and are likewise surprised by their gentle nature when they meet them.

### Firbolgs in [[Xhorhas]]

Firbolgs who travel southeast from the [[Greying Wildlands]] and cross the [[Dunrock Mountains]] might find themselves wandering the wastes of [[Xhorhas]]. The territorial monsters that prowl the wastes show no pity to unprepared wanderers, and most firbolg families know better than to undertake such a dangerous journey.

With northern [[Xhorhas]] firmly under the control of the [[Kryn Dynasty]], the dark elves have saved a number of firbolg travelers from monsters over the years. Enough of those have remained in the wastes for small firbolg communities to develop in Rosohna and other major Kryn cities.

Firbolg

Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs’ magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan’s lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.

Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.

Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders.

Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods, enforcing their will.

Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings.

Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan.

### Firbolg Names

Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest’s children by their deeds, habits, and other actions.

By the same token, their clan names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it “home.”

Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.

### Firbolg Traits

A firbolg character has the following racial traits.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.

_**Age.**_ As humanoids related to the fey, firbolg have long lifespans. A firbolg reaches adulthood around 30, and the oldest of them can live for 500 years.

_**Alignment.**_ As people who follow the rhythm of nature and see themselves as its caretakers, firbolg are typically neutral good. Evil firbolg are rare and are usually the sworn enemies of the rest of their kind.

_**Size.**_ Firbolg stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 240 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d12

Height = 6 feet + 2 inches + your size modifier in inches

Weight in pounds = 175 + (2d6 × your size modifier)

_**Speed.**_ Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

_**Firbolg Magic.**_ You can cast [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) and [disguise self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self) with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or long rest. When you use this version of [disguise self](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/disguise-self), you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with humans and elves.

_**Hidden Step.**_ As a bonus action, you can magically turn [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

_**Powerful Build.**_ You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

_**Speech of Beast and Leaf.**_ You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.

_**Languages.**_ You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and Giant.
