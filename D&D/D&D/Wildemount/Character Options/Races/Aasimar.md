## Aasimar

The light of the gods still shines upon [[Exandria]], even from behind the [[Divine Gate]]. Aasimar are the purest expression of that divine light as it burns within every mortal soul, for the souls of those blessed with an angelic ancestor blaze brighter than any other. Even rarer than the [[tieflings]] with whom they share a commonality of ancestry, aasimar are mortal, and yet are understood to be destined for a grander cosmic purpose than others around them. In every culture across the continent of [[Wildemount]], the birth of an aasimar is seen as a blessing and a portent.

Aasimar who can bear the burden of their destiny become champions of noble causes, and encourage others to walk always in the light. More often than not, however, an aasimar saddled with a vague destiny and the grand aspirations of their clan ultimately falls from grace, their inner light succumbing to shadow.

### Aasimar in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

To a law-abiding family worshiping state-approved gods, the birth of an aasimar child is nothing short of a miracle. Such a child is not only promised a charmed life, but elevates the social status of their family. However, to a family that secretly worships gods outlawed by the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], the birth of a child touched by an angel of such deities is a mixed blessing. If the event draws the scrutiny of a settlement’s [[idolmaster]] and their cronies, it might force family members to flee their homes for the [[Greying Wildlands]] or the [[Menagerie Coast]].

### Aasimar on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

In the [[Clovis Concord]], the cosmopolitan melting pot of [[Wildemount]], most folk are inured to the sight of unusual and remarkable people. Even so, aasimar are a sight to behold, and there are many who don’t mind being rude if it means spending a few extra seconds staring at a radiant aasimar as they pass by.

### Aasimar in [[Xhorhas]]

Those in the [[Kryn Dynasty]] who study [[Dunamancy]] see aasimar as brimming with near-limitless potential. As such, aasimar are often sought out from birth to be trained as dunamancers and echo knights. The tribesfolk who wander [[Xhorhas]] see the birth of an aasimar as a message from the gods, and their shamans ascribe meaning to that birth by the conditions of the world. An aasimar born during a raging storm might be a word of warning from [[Kord]] the Storm Lord, whereas an aasimar whose mother gave birth in a field of flowers could be a vow of protection from [[Melora]] the Wild Mother.

### Aasimar Guides

An aasimar, except for one who has turned evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.

The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.

As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character’s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide and Angelic Nature tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character’s guide.
