**Tag**:: #Race/WaterGenasi
**Location**:: [[Races]]

**Features**:: ['Ability Score Increase', 'Acid Resistance', 'Amphibious', 'Swim', 'Call to the Wave']

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—these things call to your heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

**Ability Score Increase**:: Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**Acid Resistance**:: You have resistance to acid damage.

**Amphibious**:: You can breathe air and water.

**Swim**:: You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

**Call to the Wave**:: You know the [shape water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shape-water) cantrip (see below). When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [create or destroy water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/create-or-destroy-water) as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
