## Fire [[Genasi]]
**Tag**:: #Race/Genasi
**Location**:: [[Genasi]]

**Features**:: ['Ability Score Increase', 'Darkvision', 'Fire Resistance', 'Reach to the Blaze']

As a fire [[genasi]], you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire [[genasi]] are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more [[Humans|human]]-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens spot actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire [[genasi]] voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

**Ability Score Increase**:: Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**Darkvision**:: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) unusual: everything you see in darkness is a shade of red.

**Fire Resistance**:: You have resistance to fire damage.

**Reach to the Blaze**:: You know the [produce flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/produce-flame) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [burning hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands) as a 1st-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
