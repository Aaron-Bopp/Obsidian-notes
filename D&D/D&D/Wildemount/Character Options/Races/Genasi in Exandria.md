## Genasi

Genasi are exceedingly rare on Exandria, as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in [[Wildemount]], and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.

Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.

### Genasi in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of [[Wildemount]]. The authoritarian regime of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in [[the Myriad]] crime syndicate.

### Genasi on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Even the cosmopolitan people of the [[Clovis Concord]] react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.

### Genasi in [[Xhorhas]]

Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of [[Xhorhas]], and many who live beyond the walls of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of [[Xhorhas]]. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the [[Vermaloc Wildwood]].

The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.

### Genasi Names

Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.

A genasi character has the following racial traits.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Constitution score increases by 2.

_**Age.**_ Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.

_**Alignment.**_ Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.

Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)

_**Speed.**_ Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

_**Languages.**_ You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.

### Genasi Subraces

There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.

#### Air Genasi

As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.

Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

_**Unending Breath.**_ You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated).

_**Mingle with the Wind.**_ You can cast the [levitate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/levitate) spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Earth Genasi

As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.

Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Strength score increases by 1.

_**Earth Walk.**_ You can move across difficult terrain made of earth and stone without expending extra movement.

_**Pass without Trace.**_ You can cast the [pass without trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace) spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

#### Fire Genasi

As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.

Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens spot actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

_**Darkvision.**_ You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your [darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/monsters#Darkvision) unusual: everything you see in darkness is a shade of red.

_**Fire Resistance.**_ You have resistance to fire damage.

_**Reach to the Blaze.**_ You know the [produce flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/produce-flame) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [burning hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/burning-hands) as a 1st-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

#### Water Genasi

The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—these things call to your heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.

Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

_**Acid Resistance.**_ You have resistance to acid damage.

_**Amphibious.**_ You can breathe air and water.

_**Swim.**_ You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast [create or destroy water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/create-or-destroy-water) as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
