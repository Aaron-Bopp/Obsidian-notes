## Half-[[Elves]]
**Tag**:: #Race/HalfElves
**Location**:: [[Races]]

Half-[[elves]] occupy all lands where [[humans]] and [[elves]] gather. In ancient times, the appearance of half-[[elves]] was a cause for alarm in elven society, for prejudiced [[elves]] saw the union between [[elves]] and [[humans]] as a symptom of impurity in their blood and culture. Such attitudes have cooled across the continent in recent centuries, and most elven societies now feature a diverse array of people—notably the pluralistic union of [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] in the city-state of [[Uthodurn]] and the diverse peoples of the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

### Half-[[Elves]] in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

The [[Dwendalian Empire]] sees half-[[elves]] as a sign that imperial rule is healthy, and that people are traveling across and strengthening the bonds of its disparate provinces. However, this belief is less pervasive in the elven enclave of [[Bysaes Tyl]], which was coerced into joining the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] decades ago. The [[elves]] of [[Bysaes Tyl]] are dedicated to maintaining a tenuous grasp on their lost realm of [[Molaesmyr]], and any [[Elves|elf]] who bears a non-[[Elves|elf]] child is considered a traitor to their ancient culture.

### Half-[[Elves]] on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

In some ways, the [[Clovis Concord]] can be considered a half-[[Elves|elf]] nation, founded as it was by the native [[Humans|human]] [[Ki’Nau]] people and by [[Elves|elf]] and [[Humans|human]] settlers from [[Marquet]]. Half-[[elves]] are also a common sight arriving on passenger ships from Tal’Dorei. The [[elves]] of Syngorn, the center of elven culture in Tal’Dorei, still hold a shameful and outdated view of their half-[[Elves|elf]] children, many of whom seek passage or stow away on ships to the [[Menagerie Coast]] to start new lives.

### Half-[[Elves]] in [[Xhorhas]]

Half-[[elves]] of all different ancestries dwell within the lands of the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], with most having one [[Dark Elves|dark elf]] parent. The idea of [[elves]] forming relationships and even having children with people of other humanoid races has long since been accepted throughout [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] lands—so much so that it seems somewhat unnatural when people outside the culture express surprise at half-[[elves]] with small, minotaur-like horns, or with the tufted ears and yellow eyes of a bugbear.
