In ancient times, kenku were black-winged angels—ambassadors who served [[the Raven Queen]] as her emissaries of death. Their voices were once heard across entire planes, calling the dead to [[the Raven Queen]]’s embrace. The kenku likewise served as her loyal warriors in [[the Calamity]], and even saved her from a near-fatal encounter with the [[Betrayer God]] known as [[Tharizdun]].

Though the kenku saved [[the Raven Queen]] from oblivion, all of her black-winged emissaries were consumed by [[Tharizdun]]’s infinite void. For long years, the kenku were thought to have been annihilated, and it was only when [[Tharizdun]] was defeated and chained by the god [[Ioun]] near [[the Calamity]]’s end that they were freed.

When the gods sealed themselves behind the [[Divine Gate]], [[the Raven Queen]] realized what her emissaries had sacrificed to save her. Though the kenku survived oblivion, they returned as mortals, stripped of all the divine gifts their god had bestowed on them: their voices, their wings, and all memories of their past existence. Bearing [[Tharizdun]]’s curse of oblivion, the kenku were reduced to squat beings that could speak only by mimicking the words of others.

Kenku exist across [[Wildemount]] in small numbers. Considered by most to be monsters, they keep to themselves as a result, always longing for something they can neither ask for nor explain. Something in a kenku’s mind stirs when it looks to the sky and see birds flying freely—an ancient longing, and a memory trapped within oblivion.

### Kenku Names

Kenku names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names.

Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone. Non-kenku refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Sample names include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher.

Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler.

Some kenku are law-abiding and pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter.
