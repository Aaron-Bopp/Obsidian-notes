## Dwarves

Dwarves’ long memories give them uncommon insight into the world of the past. However, this connection to the past can make their societies resistant to change, even when change is desperately needed.

### Dwarves in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Most folk in the [[Dwendalian Empire]] think of dwarves as greedy, cave-dwelling hermits with a passion only for jewelry, drinking, and fighting. Most dwarves in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] come from the city-state of [[Grimgolir]] and its settlements under the [[Dunrock Mountains]], whose miners, jewelers, and warriors are some of the finest in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Imperial beer, particularly smooth, sweet Trost ale from [[Trostenwald]], is a delicacy among Grimgol dwarves. The people who lived beneath the mountains never grew wheat or hops, and so never brewed beer. Until the dwarves began trading with [[humans]] from the long-fallen [[Julous Dominion]], dwarven liquor was a potent, ugly-smelling spirit called rütga, distilled from heavy root vegetables.

### Dwarves on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Along the [[Menagerie Coast]], most folk see dwarves as foreigners possessed of fiery passions and an eagerness for action. Dwarves are uncommon visitors on the coast, with most coming from the distant realms of Tal’Dorei and [[Marquet]] as sailors or travelers, as pirates from the notorious [[The Revelry|Revelry]], or as soldiers from the [[Dwendalian Empire]].

Ancient legends tell of dwarves living in mountaintop citadels in the ominous [[Cyrios Mountains]], performing strange rituals that call upon the power of the Storm Lord. Along the coast, stories of the strong passion and swift judgment of the dwarves are often a product of the legends of these religious zealots. But these beliefs have been strengthened in modern times by the clear-eyed marquis of [[Port Zoon]], [[Alamads Haddou]], who lays down laws in plain language and enacts swift justice by the letter of those laws.

### Dwarves in [[Xhorhas]]

Dwarves are few and far between in [[Xhorhas]], and those few who remain are known as [[duergar]], or “deep dwarves.” Though some [[duergar]] have joined with the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and dwell on the surface, most live in the ancient tunnels of the Underdark and harbor a deep-seated enmity for the drow.

[[Duergar]] insurgents, striking [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] settlements or seeking hidden paths toward the surface from perhaps a dozen small outposts in the Underdark, are trying to carve out their own underground dominion. [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] forces have been successful in holding onto their underground territories so far, but many generals fear that the war in the west is drawing more and more soldiers from their fortifications in the Underdark. If [[duergar]] aggression is left unchecked, territory might inevitably have to be ceded to the insurgents.
