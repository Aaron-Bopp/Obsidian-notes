## Aarakocra

Many people across [[Wildemount]] consider the winged aarakocra to be a myth, so infrequently do they descend from their lofty aeries to deal with wingless folk. Where they are known, the aarakocra rarely engage with the land-bound societies of Wildemount, though some take great pleasure in traveling on the open ocean with Concord sailors and Revelry pirates. Some legends say that [[Melora]] the Wild Mother created the aarakocra as storm herders who drive the clouds across the sky, and some aarakocra tribes play a sport called h’aara-shie, or “cloud chasing,” that reflects this ancient tale.

### Aarakocra in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Within the empire, most aarakocra keep to the hidden settlement of Vol’antim in the [[Cyrios Mountains]]. The appearance of an aarakocra is seen as a blessing in the settlements of the [[Truscan Vale]] and the [[Marrow Valley]]—often much to the aarakocra’s embarrassment. Most rural folk consider the aarakocra to be angels of [[Erathis]] the Law Bearer, no matter how diligently the aarakocra explain otherwise.

### Aarakocra on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

The few aarakocra who descend from the [[Cyrios Mountains]] or emerge from the canopy of the [[Quoraska Jungle]] for longer than a day or two are often swept up in the beauty of the sea. Thus enamored, many join a ship’s crew and set out to explore the Lucidian Ocean with their new allies. The common people of the [[Menagerie Coast]] look upon the aarakocra’s bright wings with awe and dream about taking to the sky, but are often baffled by their seemingly nonsensical idioms and figures of speech.

### Aarakocra in [[Xhorhas]]

Aarakocra are native to the mountains and jungles of western [[Wildemount]], and have precious few settlements in the mountains surrounding [[Xhorhas]]. The average Kryn dark elf would react to the sight of an aarakocra with shock, for they have neither stories nor experience with such creatures.

### Aarakocra Names

As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other races, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.

**Aarakocra Names:** Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed

### Aarakocra Traits

Being able to fly at high speed at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. Keep this in mind before allowing your players to choose this race.

An aarakocra character has the following traits.

_**Ability Score Increase.**_ Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.

_**Age.**_ Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. They don’t usually live longer than 30 years.

_**Alignment.**_ Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.

_**Size.**_ Aarakocra average 5 feet tall and have slender, lightweight bodies. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d8

Height = 4 feet + 3 inches + your size modifier in inches

Weight in pounds = 70 + (1d4 × your size modifier)

_**Speed.**_ Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

_**Flight.**_ You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.

_**Talons.**_ Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

_**Languages.**_ You can speak, read, and write Aarakocra, Auran, and Common.
