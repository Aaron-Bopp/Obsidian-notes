Genasi are exceedingly rare on [[Exandria]], as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in [[Wildemount]], and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an [[air genasi]], while a [[fire genasi]] might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.

Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.

### Genasi in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of [[Wildemount]]. The authoritarian regime of the [[Dwendalian Empire]] reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the [[Cerberus Assembly]] takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the [[Cerberus Assembly|assembly]] under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in [[The Myriad]] crime syndicate.

### Genasi on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Even the cosmopolitan people of the [[Clovis Concord]] react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.

### Genasi in [[Xhorhas]]

Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of [[Xhorhas]], and many who live beyond the walls of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]’s cities pray to [[Kord]] the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and [[water genasi]] are often born under [[Kord]]’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of [[Xhorhas]]. Few [[earth genasi]] roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the [[Vermaloc Wildwood]].

The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to [[Rosohna]].

### Genasi Names

Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.

### Genasi Traits

A genasi character has the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase**:: Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age**:: Genasi mature at about the same rate as [[humans]] and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than [[humans]] do, up to 120 years.

**Alignment**:: Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.

**Size**:: Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like [[humans]]. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:

**Size modifier**:: 2d10

**Height**:: 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches

**Weight in pounds**:: 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)

**Speed**:: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages**:: You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.
