## Humans

The most populous race in [[Wildemount]], humans define common culture across the continent. Their unrelenting ambition creates societies that aggressively pursue productivity while valuing leisure, and their short life spans often lead humans to romanticize the ugly past and fear the unknown future.

### Humans in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

In the [[Dwendalian Empire]], humans are everywhere and occupy every walk of imperial life.

Humans recoil from the unknown in ways that longer-lived folk do not, and nations dominated by a nonhuman majority are a tremendous source of fear and suspicion to human-majority nations. Human survival instinct stokes the flames of fear, especially when those flames are amply fueled by nationalistic propaganda. Such is the relationship between the [[Dwendalian Empire]] and the drow-majority [[Kryn Dynasty]] of [[Xhorhas]].

Other societies—including [[Uthodurn]]’s pluralistic society of [[elves]] and [[dwarves]]—are less maligned. However, this is because the average citizen of the empire knows nothing about those societies, reducing them to objects of curiosity for imperial scholars.

### Humans on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Within the [[Clovis Concord]], humans are seen as adept diplomats, nation builders, and loyal soldiers. They are the most populous people of the [[Menagerie Coast]], but ever since [[the founding]] of the Clovis Concord, that nation has been one defined by its diversity. Although other nations of [[Wildemount]] and the world might consider humans to be the definitive, adaptable jacks-of-all-trades, the people of the Concord know that all folk have this capacity.

### Humans in [[Xhorhas]]

Humans are rare in [[Xhorhas]], and those found within that land typically belong to wandering clans or are soldiers of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Aside from such soldiers, humans are not viewed with inherent suspicion by most Xhorhasians, but the war between the [[Kryn Dynasty]] and the Dwendalian Empire has made Xhorhas an even more dangerous land for all human travelers. [[Dark Elves]] and monsters that might treat a wandering human with caution elsewhere are likely to attack on sight in Xhorhas, because they know that an imperial human will do the same to them.
