## Goblinkin

The civilized people of the world consider goblins to be nothing more than monsters—and in many ways, they’re right. Goblins and their cousins, the hobgoblins and bugbears, were first created by [[Bane]], as foot soldiers for his unholy army. Eons ago, when the flames of [[the Calamity]] burned across [[Exandria]], the Betrayer Gods gathered in the realm that would eventually become [[Xhorhas]]. There, they found a people known as the [[dranassar]]. An ancestor race to the goblinoids, the dranassar were tall and beautiful, strong of body and mind, and fleet of foot. Their hair was thick and black, and their skin gleamed like gold. Most of the dranassar willingly served the divine beings that descended upon their land, but a few fought back against the Betrayer Gods’ rule.

[[Bane]], a cruel tyrant even among the Betrayer Gods, smote the rebellious [[dranassar]] and twisted them into the goblinkin. When the armies of the Betrayer Gods wanted for skirmishers, Bane twisted the dranassar into goblins. When he was in need of loyal soldiers, he made them into hobgoblins. And when brute force was required, he sculpted them into bugbears. As the war of gods and mortals raged on, Bane corrupted even those dranassar who remained loyal to him.

The Betrayer Gods are long since defeated, but the goblinkin survived—leaderless, lost, and fallen into chaos. It is said that the voice of [[Bane]] still whispers into the minds of the goblinkin, goading them to commit senseless acts of cruelty against all they see.

Few goblins can steel their will against [[Bane]]’s foul whispers, but those who do live peaceful lives free of the god’s influence. Likewise, people who are transfigured into goblins or reborn as goblins do not hear the voice of Bane, and are free from his curse of strife.

### Goblinkin in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

Goblins living in [[Western Wynandir]] form small tribal groups and do their best to evade the vigilant eye of the imperial army. The fearsome soldiers of the Righteous Brand, known to the goblins as _drohurror_ or “terrorfolk,” are the greatest threat to the tribes. But with goblins treated as little better than vermin throughout the empire, any imperial citizen strong enough to wield a pitchfork can be a threat in their own right.

With most goblins in the empire tormented by [[Bane]]’s homicidal whispers, the people of the empire are just as fearful of goblinkin as the goblins are of them. Farmers and folk in rural regions such as the southern [[Marrow Valley]] take special precautions against goblin raids, and kill goblins on sight as if they were marauding animals. Even goblins who manage to free themselves of Bane’s influence are hard-pressed to overcome the fears of the empire’s rural folk. By contrast, city dwellers are rarely exposed to goblin raiders, and though they might react with suspicion and fear when seeing a goblin on the street, most are more accepting of the notion that not all goblins are evil.

### Goblinkin on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

Goblins are a rare sight on the [[Menagerie Coast]], so most folk who live there know of them only through folklore and stories told by travelers. With visitors from the [[Dwendalian Empire]], the realms of Tal’Dorei, and [[Marquet]] common on the coast, most of those stories are tales of the vicious goblins of the Ravager horde of Tal’Dorei or the fearsome Duneburrow goblins of the far-off Marquesian deserts, painting a deeply unwholesome picture of goblinkin.

People living along the northern [[Menagerie Coast]], in cities such as [[Gwardan]], have firsthand accounts of the goblins and bugbears who have recently settled in the [[Lushgut Forest]]. Those who worship the Wild Mother in Gwardan have long seen the forest as one of her most sacred places, and initially reacted with fear to the forest’s “monstrous invaders.” But with the bugbears and goblins having freed themselves of [[Bane]]’s corrupting influence through druidic meditation, they are slowly fostering friendship with the people of Gwardan.

### Goblinkin in [[Xhorhas]]

Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears are a common sight in [[Xhorhas]], especially around [[Rosohna]]—for it was here that [[Bane]] first created the goblinkin from the noble [[dranassar]]. The people of the [[Kryn Dynasty]] have made efforts to forge close ties with the goblinkin who have made their home in the region, and have even managed to subvert the curse of strife by the power of [[the Luxon]]. Any creature reborn into a goblinkin body is born without the curse, and any natural-born goblin born within one hundred miles of a [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) is likewise shielded from Bane’s seed of corruption.
