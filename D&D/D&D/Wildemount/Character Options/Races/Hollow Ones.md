## Hollow One

The eastern coast of Xhorhas, known to the Kryn as Blightshore, is a land scarred by evil magic. Among the creations of that foul place are the Hollow Ones, beings whose souls have left for the afterlife, yet whose bodies still retain a fragment of their former selves.

Hollow One

The magic that sustains Hollow Ones is a mystery. Most Hollow Ones are reborn after dying in Blightshore, suggesting that the spell-scarred nature of the land brought them back for an unknown purpose. Yet some beings find that, days after they died, they awaken, clutching to life, with only a terrible emptiness inside to remind them of their death.

In Blightshore, Hollow Ones are seen as a people like any other. They seem strange, but the adventurous and hardy folk of Blightshore are used to making allies with strange creatures. Elsewhere, Hollow Ones are indistinguishable from living creatures, save for the faint stench of necromancy that lingers about them.

The transition from life to becoming a Hollow One affects different people to different degrees. Some let their anger and regret consume them. Others use their second chance to become a brighter force in the world. However, all Hollow Ones are marked by their new existence: feelings of unease, dread or sadness cling to them like tattered rags of their past life.

### Supernatural Gift: Hollow One

The Dungeon Master has the option to allow a character created in a Wildemount campaign to be a Hollow One. Alternatively, a character who perishes in the course of a campaign might return as a Hollow One, created by the mysterious forces that scar the land.

As a Hollow One, the void left behind by your departed soul is filled with the strange magic of Blightshore. Becoming a Hollow One is a supernatural gift (see “[Supernatural Gifts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/other-rewards#SupernaturalGifts "Supernatural Gifts")” in chapter 7 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")) that bestows upon you the following traits.

_**Ageless.**_ You don’t age, and effects that would cause you to age don’t work on you.

_**Cling to Life.**_ When you make a death saving throw and roll 16 or higher, you regain 1 hit point.

_**Revenance.**_ You retain your creature type, yet you register as undead to spells and other effects that detect the presence of the undead creature type.

_**Unsettling Presence.**_ As an action, you can unsettle a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes within the next minute. Constructs, undead, and creatures that can’t be [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) are immune to this feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
