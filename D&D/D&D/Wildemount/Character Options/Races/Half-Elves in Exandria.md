## Half-Elves

Half-elves occupy all lands where humans and elves gather. In ancient times, the appearance of half-elves was a cause for alarm in elven society, for prejudiced elves saw the union between elves and humans as a symptom of impurity in their blood and culture. Such attitudes have cooled across the continent in recent centuries, and most elven societies now feature a diverse array of people—notably the pluralistic union of dwarves and elves in the city-state of [[Uthodurn]] and the diverse peoples of the [[Kryn Dynasty]].

### Half-Elves in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]

The [[Dwendalian Empire]] sees half-elves as a sign that imperial rule is healthy, and that people are traveling across and strengthening the bonds of its disparate provinces. However, this belief is less pervasive in the elven enclave of [[Bysaes Tyl]], which was coerced into joining the empire decades ago. The elves of Bysaes Tyl are dedicated to maintaining a tenuous grasp on their lost realm of [[Molaesmyr]], and any elf who bears a non-elf child is considered a traitor to their ancient culture.

### Half-Elves on the [[Menagerie Coast]]

In some ways, the [[Clovis Concord]] can be considered a half-elf nation, founded as it was by the native human Ki’Nau people and by elf and human settlers from [[Marquet]]. Half-elves are also a common sight arriving on passenger ships from Tal’Dorei. The elves of Syngorn, the center of elven culture in Tal’Dorei, still hold a shameful and outdated view of their half-elf children, many of whom seek passage or stow away on ships to the [[Menagerie Coast]] to start new lives.

### Half-Elves in [[Xhorhas]]

Half-elves of all different ancestries dwell within the lands of the Kryn, with most having one dark elf parent. The idea of elves forming relationships and even having children with people of other humanoid races has long since been accepted throughout Kryn lands—so much so that it seems somewhat unnatural when people outside the culture express surprise at half-elves with small, minotaur-like horns, or with the tufted ears and yellow eyes of a bugbear.
