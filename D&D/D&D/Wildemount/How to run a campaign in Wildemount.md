## A New D&D Setting

Wildemount is a new setting for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign, originally created by Matthew Mercer as the setting for the second campaign of the hit series Critical Role. Though it’s just one continent in the larger world of Exandria, Wildemount is teeming with varied cultures, locales, peoples, and monsters. It is home to both avatars of evil and paragons of good, but it is defined by the common people who exist in between these two ideals.

This book is for D&D players and Dungeon Masters of all experience levels. It is for newcomers and for hardcore fans of Critical Role alike. If you’ve watched every episode of Critical Role to date, this book will still contain surprises for you, as there are corners of Wildemount that even the Mighty Nein weren’t able to explore in their adventures.

If you’re a Dungeon Master, this book will help you create a D&D campaign set in a land of war, intrigue, and swashbuckling adventure. You could set your campaign entirely within one of Wildemount’s four regions, or you could follow the example set by Critical Role and create a campaign with a constantly evolving tone as the adventurers journey across the continent. You will also find brand-new monsters and introductory adventures that can help you start a campaign in any of Wildemount’s four regions.

If you’re a player, this book contains new options that will help your character fit in perfectly with this strange new land. You can use the heroic chronicle system to create a backstory that firmly roots your character in the lands of Wildemount. You’ll also find new subclasses as well as new magic items that will help you attain greater and greater power as you travel the continent.

## Nations of Wildemount

Wildemount’s various regions are described in greater detail in [[Wildemount Gazetteer]] Here’s a quick overview of the major civilizations of Wildemount.

### [[Dwendalian Empire]]

The Dwendalian Empire is a young, ambitious state borne from decades of strife in Western Wynandir — the heartland of Wildemount. Its austere lands are dotted with tiny villages, ruins of ancient civilizations, and pockets of uncharted wilderness.

Campaigns set in the Dwendalian Empire are bound to involve elements of war and political intrigue. The empire is at war with the Kryn Dynasty, a nation of surface-dwelling drow which occupies Eastern Wynandir and the wastes of Xhorhas. This war allows various Dwendalian factions, such as the power-hungry Cerberus Assembly, to vie for political dominance.

### [[Clovis Concord]]

The Clovis Concord is a republic of city-states lining the Menagerie Coast, the westernmost shore of Wildemount. This tropical region is rich with history and known for a lively, free-spirited culture that contrasts sharply with Wildemount’s other, politically narrow-minded nations.

Campaigns set on the Menagerie Coast are often nautical, exploring the conflict between the law of the Clovis Concord and the chaos of the Revelry pirates. They can also investigate the jungles that line the coast and the ancient ruins hidden within their verdant boughs.

### [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]]

The Tribes of Shadycreek Run are a fragmented coalition of thieves, slavers, and scoundrels who managed to amass power in the frigid backwater of Shadycreek Run. While they struggle to enrich themselves through crime, however, they fail to realize that malign, primordial powers are creeping into the north underneath their noses.

Campaigns set in the Biting North often involve morally gray characters butting heads with equally amoral organizations in a struggle to survive — and then explode into chaos as forces beyond mortal imagination make all these petty conflicts seem insignificant by comparison.

### [[Kryn Dynasty]]

The Kryn Dynasty is an empire made up of dark elves (drow) and other humanoids typically considered to be monsters by the other nations of Wildemount, such as minotaurs, goblinkin, and gnolls. The Kryn Dynasty rules over the wastes of Xhorhas, a land once blighted by the rule of the Betrayer Gods when immortals still walked the land. The Kryn safeguard a secret; if your players haven’t seen any of Critical Role, revealing this secret could mark the turning point of a campaign.

A campaign set in Xhorhas will doubtless involve the war between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, but it can also include traditional dungeon crawls, political intrigue within the courts of the dynasty, or even wilderness exploration that could unearth secrets lost since the fall of the Betrayer Gods.


## War!

The continent of Wildemount is a powder keg about to explode. Tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty have just erupted into open war, and everyone in Wildemount, including the adventurers, must contend with the fallout of the conflict between the continent’s two imperial superpowers.

### The War of Ash and Light

The war is only as important as you make it. If you place either the battles of the war or their consequences front and center, the war will be of chief concern to your players. If you keep the war and its consequences distant, then the characters will be free to interact with or ignore the war as they see fit. With a little bit of creative tweaking of the setting, you could create a Wildemount campaign where the war has been called off or never even happened!

If you want the war to be an important part of your campaign, you need to give your players a reason for their characters to care about it. The easiest way to get buy-in from your players is to discuss out-of-character how big of a factor they want war to be in this campaign. You can even dial the importance of the war up and down over the course of the campaign, depending on how you and your players feel over time.

#### Bring It On!

If you and your players find war to be dramatic and compelling, urge your players to create characters with strong ties to the conflict. For example, patriotic (or even jingoistic) characters will always fight for king or queen and country. Likewise, greedy characters will fight for profit and glory. Once they’ve given you their reasons, turn those motivations into plot points in your campaign.

#### In the Background

The adventurers don’t have to be active combatants for the war to affect their lives. See below for a list of adventure options that touch on the consequences of war without directly involving mass warfare.

#### No War, Please

If you want the war to be completely absent, simply dial the timeline back by a year, or even just a few months. All the political tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty still exist, but now they’re just simmering instead of at a full boil.

### Adventuring Options

Not all campaigns set in Wildemount need to deal with the war directly. That is, the characters aren’t expected to conscript with one army or another, or even serve as mercenaries. The effects of war are far-reaching and multifarious, and loose-cannon adventurers are the perfect people to get involved in the countless conflicts sparked by war. These schemes could include:

**Crime.** In times of war, criminals and smugglers take advantage of lax law enforcement. Petty criminals and crime syndicates like the Myriad will need help moving illicit goods in and out of Dwendalian and Xhorhasian cities, and Revelry pirates will need loyal crew members to raid unprotected towns.

**Disaster.** When a town is destroyed by advancing armies, or by a landslide caused by artillery, the common folk need help escaping. This could involve escorting noncombatants through no-man’s-land to a nearby town, or carving out a new settlement from the wilds.

**Law.** When officers of the law are conscripted as soldiers, local lawmasters suddenly find themselves in need of mercenary aid. Lawful characters might find great adventure in flushing criminals out of cities and busting their wilderness hideaways.

**Military.** Obviously, characters can choose to join up with one of the sides in this conflict to embark on missions and take orders from a commanding officer. This is a good option if you want to run an episodic campaign, where most game sessions begin with a stated mission that the players must accomplish and ends with a reward and another mission.

**Upheaval.** The explosions of artillery and the pounding of boots against the plains can spook monsters, and invasions can cause even powerful monsters such as giants and dragons to flee their lairs. Whenever an upheaval occurs, soldiers and commoners alike find their lives in danger — and only adventurers can deal with the threat.

**Trade.** Like the crime syndicates, opportunistic traders know that war is a chance to become rich. Adventurers are the perfect pawns for trade barons looking to sell high-value goods, especially if they have to cross dangerous land to reach their buyers.

### How to Run a War Campaign

If there’s one thing D&D adventurers hate, it’s being told what to do, but serving in an army is all about following orders. It’s up to the Dungeon Master to make sure the characters are aware of what they’re getting into if they decide to enlist. Similarly, if you force your players to join a military unit and then discover that the characters actually want to go on self-directed adventures without a commanding officer ordering them around, you and your players should talk out-of-game to figure out a way to turn the campaign around.

Since D&D is primarily a game about a small group of characters going on adventures alone, it can be difficult to simulate massive battles using D&D combat rules. Because of this, it’s generally best to keep the characters away from mass battles. However, huge conflicts with thousands of combatants are a cornerstone of epic fantasy, and your players might be disappointed if your war campaign doesn’t have at least one climactic battle.

To solve this problem, you can break down your mass combat into manageable chunks. Find a significant location that the characters can either defend or conquer with minimal reinforcements, like an overrun citadel. Then, have the major battle proceed in waves that guide the characters from one cinematic encounter to another. You can think of these encounters like rooms in a dungeon; some rooms have multiple doors that the characters can choose from, while others only have a single passage.

For example, after capturing the ruined fortress, the characters learn that a garrison of soldiers has arrived to help hold onto the fort, and the characters are needed elsewhere on the battlefield. You could present them with just a single urgent target, such as an enemy warlord, or you could offer them options, such as three different allied battalions under attack.

If you need to depict a lot of both allied and hostile NPCs battling in the same encounter as the players, you can simplify the encounter by ignoring dice rolls entirely and deciding when a creature dies based on your own instinct. This can work once in a while, but try to avoid doing this all the time, since seeing you simply decide the result of combat without dice can damage the believability of your game world.
