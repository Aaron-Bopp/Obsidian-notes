# Character
Grace was at [[Camp Holy Rock]] last year when [[The Incident]] occurred. Of course she does not remember it, but she does remember the nightmares that she had for weeks afterword. [[Karen Waters]] is very concerned about Grace, and will do almost anything to prevent her from getting into a situation with monsters again. Once Grace gets back to camp the nightmares come back with a vengeance, but she tells nobody. She did invite her younger sister [[Miya Moreston]] to be a counselor as an attempt to soothe her fears.
