# Camp Holy Rock
## Mystery
### Dog on the path
Alligator attacks a dog on one of the mountains trails at [[Camp Holy Rock]]. Hides well in bushes and then strikes so quickly that nobody can see what it was. It slithers through the bushes until it reaches a creak and then follows it back to its cavern
### Attack at the pond
Tommy lurks in the pond. [[Harley Cotts]] stops [[Parmis Davies]] and [[Alex Beck]] from going out on the dock and/or falling in the water. This prevents Tommy from being able to make and attack, but [[Harley Cotts]] does see tracks through the mud into the woods
