# Character
## Backstory
Mom (Miriam) worked for [[NACMA]] but liaison with actual US military so we moved a lot bc military fam through my mom. She died of cancer like five years ago so I want to live up to her image of being a great monster Hunter. My dad, Scott Cotts, is a chill sweet guy that’s super supportive and still had contact with agency so that’s how I got in. I’m a driven, lesbian survivalist sent to the camp to work on my people skills so I can better protect bystanders. I have a side shave and wear gray ribbed tank tops and cargo pants/shorts and tall socks with my hiking shoes.
