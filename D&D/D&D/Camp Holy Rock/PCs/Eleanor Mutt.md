### Backstory
A very book oriented childhood led to an unhealthy obsession with the Harry Potter series. For her 14th birthday her parents suprised her with a trip to orlando studios and the night she got her wand was the night everything changed. She stood out on the porch of the hotel room one night and shouted out "Stupify!" and to her utmost suprise a red light flashed and flew out into the sky. Of course her parents didn't believe her and she wasn't able to repricate... It took awhile to be able to cast on command but when she could she decided to hide it from others. She realized it wasn't normal. Shortly after she ran into a new issue and that was monsters. During a normal spell training session a ghost accompanied by a very weiry human appeared. This human was also a wizard and informed Eleanor of the world and what lies ahead for her life. He informed her of the [[Northern Floridians Pottermore Fan Club]] and to hide her magic from others.
