Maybe you're hoping that this summer will be a bit more exciting that normal, maybe you are running away from something whether you know what it is or not, or maybe you just decided that it would be fun to be a camp counselor. When you signed up to be a counselor for Camp Holy Rock you expected to have some summer fun, get away from your problems, and maybe make some new friends, but instead you are plunged head first into a world of mystery, magic, and monsters.

In Monster of the Week, the world of monsters is just below the surface of societies collective consciousness. Much like our real world you've heard ghost stories, and watched shows about bigfoot hunting, maybe you even saw a shape in the shadows that you were just never able to explain. Maybe you never thought they were real, or you had an odd fascination with finding out, or maybe you got a little closer than most people that would have wanted, but there's nothing special about you, except that you're one of the ones who know's monsters are real.

# Daily Life
Every week [[Albert Murphy]] brings in a new set of campers for the counselors to take care of. Mon-Thurs the camp is a day camp, going till about 4pm, but on Thursday, the campers sleep over into Friday. They enjoy some extra fun, extra time at the snack shop, and extra time with their new friends. On the weekend, the counselors get the campground to themselves (outside of [[Grace Moreston]]).
