## Moves
- **Bad Luck Charm**: 
	- Whenever you use magic and miss, the backlash never affects you directly if there’s someone else around to hit. It’ll go for allies, other hunters, and innocent bystanders. Sometimes, every so often, it might even hit an enemy
- **Force of Will**: roll +*Weird* 
	- When you apply your will to dispelling a magical effect, blocking a spell, or suspending a Phenomenon. 
	- **On a hit**, momentary magics are canceled completely, and long-lasting spells and effects are suspended temporarily. 
	- On a **10+**, you can also spend Luck to instantly snuff out a powerful spell or  strange  effect.  
	- On  a  **7-9**  you  take  1-harm  as  the  strain of dismissing magic unravels you.
- **Luck of the Damned**: 
	- After you use magic or cast a rote, take +1 forward on the next roll you make

### Rotes
- **Mind Worm**: roll +*Weird* 
	- When you can perceive a creature of interest you launch a psychic attack that lodges a worm in their brain. When a worm is lodged you can ask one question from [[Investigate a mystery]]
		- On a *10+*, you lodge a worm in the brain of your target. You can immediately deal two harm and end the connection or you can maintain the worm. The target is not aware of you until they take damage
		- On a *7-9*, you lodge a worm in the brain of your target. You can immediately deal one harm and end the connection or you can maintain the worm. The target is immediately aware of you, but is not immediately aware of what you are doing
		- On a *miss*, you fail to lodge a worm and the creature you were trying to perceive is immediately aware of your attempt. If they cannot understand what you were doing they are filled with a intense foreboding towards you
	- **Maintaining the connection**:
		- For every additional 5 seconds you maintain the worm you can ask a question from [[Investigate a mystery]], take an additional harm, and store up an additional harm
		- When the connection ends, the creature immediately takes the damage you has been stored up
	- **Requirements**: Object of power, spilling of blood
		- You must have access to two of your five senses that can directly interact with the target
		- You or a willing person must take 1-harm for every 5 seconds the worm is maintained

## Temptation
**Secrets**: Use magic to discover forbidden, dangerous knowledge

You have a dangerous drive that you pursue, sometimes to the exclusion of your own safety. You need to act under pressure to resist giving in to your temptation, if a perfect opportunity presents itself; if you fail this roll, you don’t mark experience like you would have if you’d willingly  acted out your desires.

### Other Temptations

- **Vengeance**: Use magic to inflict disproportionate retribution on someone who wronged you
- **Power**: Use magic to exert your dominance over another
- **Addiction**: Use magic to do what you could do without it
- **Callousness**: Use magic without regard for the safety of others.
- **Carnage**: Use magic to inflict gruesome violence
- **Glory**: Use magic to steal someone’s thunder.
