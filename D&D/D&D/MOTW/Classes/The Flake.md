*Everything’s connected. But not everyone can see the patterns, and most people don’t even look that hard.*

*But me, I can never stop looking deeper. I can never stop seeing the truth.*

*I spot the patterns. That’s how I found the [[monsters]], and that’s how I help kill them.*

To make your Flake, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG9.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, transgressive, concealed.
- Wild eyes, moving eyes, focused eyes, searching eyes, suspicious eyes, wide eyes, guarded eyes.
- Ratty clothes, casual clothes, rumpled suit, neat clothes, comfortable clothes, army surplus [[gear]].

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm+1, Cool+1, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird=0
- Charm=0, Cool+1, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird+1
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough+1, Weird=0
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird+1
- Charm-1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird+2

**[[MOVES]]**

*You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus pick three Flake [[moves]]:*

- **Connect the Dots**: At the beginning of each mystery, if **you look for the wider patterns** that current events might be part of, roll [[+Sharp]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 3, and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1. Spend your [[hold]] during the mystery to ask [[the Keeper]] any one of the following questions: 
  - *Is this person connected to current events more than they are saying?*
  - *When and where will the next critical event occur?*
  - *What does the monster want from this person?*
  - *Is this connected to previous mysteries we have investigated?*
  - *How does this mystery connect to the bigger picture?*
- **Crazy Eyes**: You get +1 Weird (max +3).
- **See, It All Fits Together**: You can use Sharp instead of Charm when you **[[manipulate someone]]**.
- **Suspicious Mind**: If someone lies to you, you know it.
- **Often Overlooked**: When **you** **act all crazy** to avoid something, roll [[+Weird]]. On a 10+ you’re regarded as unthreatening and unimportant. On a 7-9, pick one: unthreatening or unimportant. On a miss, you draw lots (but not all) of the attention.
- **Contrary**: When **you seek out and receive someone’s honest advice** on the best course of action for you and then do something else instead, mark experience. If you do exactly the opposite of their advice, you also take +1 [[ongoing]] on any [[moves]] you make pursuing that course.
- **Net Friends**: You know a lot of people on the Internet. When **you** **contact a net friend to help you** with a mystery, roll [[+Charm]]. On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information. On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. On a miss, you burn some bridges.
- **Sneaky**: When **you attack from ambush, or from behind**, inflict +2 [[harm]].

**[[GEAR]]**

You get one normal weapon and two hidden [[weapons]].

Normal [[weapons]] (pick one):

- .38 revolver (2-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-[[harm]] close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-[[harm]] far loud)
- Magnum (3-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] close messy loud)
- Big knife (1-[[harm]] hand)

Hidden [[weapons]] (pick two):

- Throwing knives (1-[[harm]] close many)
- Holdout pistol (2-[[harm]] close loud reload)
- Garrote (3-[[harm]] intimate)
- Watchman’s flashlight (1-[[harm]] hand)
- Weighted gloves/brass knuckles (1-[[harm]] hand)
- Butterfly knife/folding knife (1-[[harm]] hand)

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Flake by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- They’re somehow tied into it all. You’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- They’re a close relative. Ask them to decide exactly what.
- Old friends, who originally met through a long chain of coincidences.
- You went through hell together: maybe a monster, maybe military service, maybe time in an institution. Whatever it was, it bound you together, and you have total trust in each other.
- Members of the same support group.
- Fellow freaks.
- The signs all pointed to working together. So you found them and now you work together.
- You know each other through cryptozoology and conspiracy theory websites.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Sharp, max +3
- Get +1 Charm, max +2
- Get +1 Cool, max +2
- Get +1 Weird, max +2
- Take another Flake move
- Take another Flake move
- Get a haven, like [[The Expert]] has, with two options
- Gain another option for your haven
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
