*Everything’s connected. But not everyone can see the patterns, and most people don’t even look that hard.*

*But me, I can never stop looking deeper. I can never stop seeing the truth.*

*I spot the patterns. That’s how I found the [[monsters]], and that’s how I help kill them.*

To make your Flake, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, transgressive, concealed.
- Wild eyes, moving eyes, focused eyes, searching eyes, suspicious eyes, wide eyes, guarded eyes.
- Ratty clothes, casual clothes, rumpled suit, neat clothes, comfortable clothes, army surplus [[gear]].

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]=0
- [[Charm]]=0, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]+1
- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]=0
- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+1
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+2

## **[[MOVES]]**


*You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus pick three Flake [[moves]]:*

- Weighted gloves/brass knuckles (1-[[harm]] [[hand]])
- Butterfly knife/folding knife (1-[[harm]] [[hand]])

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Flake by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- They’re somehow tied into it all. You’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- They’re a [[close]] relative. Ask them to decide exactly what.
- Old friends, who originally met through a long chain of coincidences.
- You went through hell together: maybe a monster, maybe military service, maybe time in an institution. [[Whatever]] it was, it bound you together, and you have total trust in each other.
- Members of the same support group.
- Fellow freaks.
- The signs all pointed to working together. So you found them and now you work together.
- You know each other through cryptozoology and conspiracy theory websites.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Charm]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +2
- Take another Flake move
- Take another Flake move
- Get a [[haven]], like [[The Expert]] has, with two options
- Gain another option for your [[haven]]
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
