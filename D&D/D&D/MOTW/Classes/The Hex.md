# The Hex

> “I didn’t have [[magic]] fall into my lap. I’m not blessed, I’m not one of the scary children—I’m just a girl who found a way to give herself the strength to fight this war. I don’t have the option of not taking this risk.”

To make your [[Hex]], first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], Temptation, and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![[image40.png]]

**Look, pick one from each list:**

- Woman, man, transgressing, unknown, nonbinary, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- [[Sharp]] eyes, angry eyes, glowing eyes, shifty eyes, serene eyes, featureless eyes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ eyes.

- Retro clothes, hippy clothes, trendy clothes, too-formal clothes, ill-fitting clothes, anachronistic clothes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clothes.

**Ratings, pick one line:**

- [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]–1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]–1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]–1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]–1, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]=0, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]–1, [[Weird]]+2

## Rotes

Whenever you **[[Use Magic]]**, you can decide afterwards that a particular spell is a **rote** that you know. Write down in detail what the spell does, and what it requires. You know how to cast it off the top of your head, and you choose two requirements from this list:

- [[Magic]] words and ritual [[Gestures]].

- An object of power (wand, talisman, orb, staff, etc) which must be wielded.

- ![[image42.jpg]]
- An expendable component such as sulfur, sage, or incense, which must be burned, blown, or scattered during the casting.

- Runes or symbols written or engraved on a surface (which must be prepared).

- A spilling of blood, which inflicts 1-[[harm]] upon you or a willing participant.

Give your new rote a name, and decide specifically what the requirements are (which words, [[Gestures]], objects, symbols, and procedures are required). Unlike regular **[[Use Magic]]**, a rote’s cost and the consequences for failing it are known to you in advance. After you cast it for the first time, treat each rote as a custom move—a specialised version of [[Use Magic]], which is built with [[the Keeper]]. Write down what it does on a 10+, a 7-9, and a miss. Also, a rote is a bit more powerful than a basic **[[Use Magic]]** spell: its glitches are less onerous and its effect may be a little bigger.

Casting a rote requires you to have the needed items at [[hand]] and the ability to physically use them. You roll +[[Weird]] to cast it, as you would when **using [[magic]]** normally.

You start out knowing up to one rote, which you can choose when creating your character or during play. You can learn more by taking [[improvements]]—when you do, you can choose the new rote right away or in play.

## Temptation

You have a dangerous drive that you pursue, sometimes to the exclusion of your own safety. Decide if your Temptation drove you to learn [[magic]], or if learning [[magic]] drove you to it.

Whenever you give in to your Temptation and act accordingly, you mark experience. You need to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to resist giving in to your temptation, if a perfect opportunity presents itself; if you fail this roll, you don’t mark experience like you would have if you’d willingly acted out your desires.

Choose one Temptation: b **Vengeance:** [[Use Magic]] to inflict disproportionate retribution on someone who wronged you.

- **Power:** [[Use Magic]] to exert your dominance over another. b **Addiction:** [[Use Magic]] to do what you could do without it. b **Callousness:** [[Use Magic]] without regard for the safety of others.

- **Carnage:** [[Use Magic]] to inflict gruesome violence.

- **Secrets:** [[Use Magic]] to discover forbidden, dangerous knowledge.

- **Glory:** [[Use Magic]] to steal someone’s thunder.

## Moves

You have three [[Hex]] [[moves]]. You have this one:

- ![[Bad Luck Charm]]
- ![[Burn Everything]]
- ![[Cast the Bones]]
- ![[Force of Will]]
- ![[Luck of the Damned]]
- ![[Sympathetic Token]]
- ![[This Might Sting]]
- ![[Wise Soul]]
## Gear

You have [[whatever]] magical items or amulets you use to perform [[magic]], including [[whatever]] you need to cast your rotes. You also have two wizardly [[weapons]].

**Wizardly [[weapons]], pick two:**

- .38 revolver b Athame b Crossbow (2-[[harm]] [[close]] (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] (2-[[harm]] [[reload]] [[loud]]) [[magic]] silver) [[close]] [[slow]])

- Shotgun b Shillelagh b Staff (1-[[harm]] (3-[[harm]] [[close]] (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[hand]] [[balanced]] [[messy]] [[loud]]) [[balanced]]) large) **[[Introductions]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your [[Hex]] by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- You once cast a powerful spell or curse on them. Tell them why, and ask them how it ended.

- They fear your power, or what you might do with it. Ask them why.

- You’re madly in love with them. Ask them if they can tell.

- They encourage you to indulge your temptation. Ask them why.

- They keep you grounded, and are unfazed by your displays of power.

- You were part of the same cult, sect, or secret society. Decide together what horrible things you did in the name of power.

- You [[learned]] through divination that they’re important and you should help them. Decide whether you’ve told them or not.

- They helped you out when a spell went awry. Tell them what the spell was, and ask them how they helped you.

## Luck

You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[Hex]] Special**: When you spend [[Luck]], until the end of the mystery, backlash on your spells will be extra nasty.

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list.

## Improvements

- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +3. 
- Take another Rote. 
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2. 
- Take another Rote. 
- Get +1 [[Charm]], max +2. 
- Take another Rote. 
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2. 
- Take another [[Hex]] move, or an additional Rote. 
- Take another [[Hex]] move, or an additional Rote. 
- Take a [[Haven]], like [[The Expert]] has, with two options. 
- Take a move from another playbook.

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMprovements]]**  

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3. 
- Change this hunter to a new type. 
- Make up a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced. 
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Erase one used [[Luck]] mark from your playbook.
- Gain another two Rotes. 
- Choose one advanced [[Hex]] move (see below).

## Advanced Hex Moves

When you take the “Choose one advanced [[Hex]] move” improvement, choose one of these [[moves]]. You can never have both:

- **Apotheosis**: You become a terrifying fount of mystical power. Once per mystery, after you suffer loss or [[harm]], you may enter a state where you have both immense power and zero interest in the well-being of other people. While in this state, you can fly, use +[[Weird]] to **[[Kick Some Ass]]** instead of +[[Tough]] (using innate [[magic]] as a 3-[[harm]] weapon with [[whatever]] properties you choose), ignore the component costs of your rotes, ignore one requirement of every spell you cast with **[[Use Magic]]**, and you have +1 [[ongoing]] to do everything. On the other [[hand]], you outright cannot use the **[[Protect Someone]]** move, you have all the Temptations, and you have to indulge them whenever a good opportunity presents itself. When you try to resist a temptation, roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+, your apotheosis ends. On a 7-9, it ends with you doing something dangerous or cruel. On a miss, it ends only after you [[harm]] someone (or something) you love.

- **Synthesis**: You manage to conciliate your dark power with your moral impulses. You lose your Temptation. Whenever you **[[Use Magic]]** to **[[Help Out]]** or **[[Protect Someone]]**, you mark experience. Mark a second experience if you do it at the expense of your own safety.
