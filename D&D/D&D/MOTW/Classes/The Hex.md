# The Hex
> “I didn’t have magic fall into my lap. I’m not blessed, I’m not one of the scary children—I’m just a girl who found a way to give herself the strength to fight this war. I don’t have the option of not taking this risk.” 

To make your Hex, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], Temptation, and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![[image40.png]]

**Look, pick one from each list:**

-   Woman, man, transgressing, unknown, nonbinary, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   Sharp eyes, angry eyes, glowing eyes, shifty eyes, serene eyes, featureless eyes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ eyes.

-   Retro clothes, hippy clothes, trendy clothes, too-formal clothes, ill-fitting clothes, anachronistic clothes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clothes.

**Ratings, pick one line:**

b Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp=0, Tough–1, Weird+2 b Charm+1, Cool–1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2 b Charm–1, Cool+1, Sharp=0, Tough+1, Weird+2 b Charm–1, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird+2 b Charm=0, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough–1, Weird+2

## Rotes

Whenever you **[[use magic]]**, you can decide afterwards that a particular spell is a **rote** that you know. Write down in detail what the spell does, and what it requires. You know how to cast it off the top of your head, and you choose two requirements from this list:

-   Magic words and ritual gestures.

-   An object of power (wand, talisman, orb, staff, etc) which must be wielded.

-   ![[image42.jpg]]An expendable component such as sulfur, sage, or incense, which must be burned, blown, or scattered during the casting.

-   Runes or symbols written or engraved on a surface (which must be prepared).

-   A spilling of blood, which inflicts 1-[[harm]] upon you or a willing participant.

Give your new rote a name, and decide specifically what the requirements are (which words, gestures, objects, symbols, and procedures are required). Unlike regular **[[use magic]]**, a rote’s cost and the consequences for failing it are known to you in advance. After you cast it for the first time, treat each rote as a custom move—a specialised version of [[Use Magic]], which is built with [[the Keeper]]. Write down what it does on a 10+, a 7-9, and a miss. Also, a rote is a bit more powerful than a basic **[[use magic]]** spell: its glitches are less onerous and its effect may be a little bigger.

Casting a rote requires you to have the needed items at hand and the ability to physically use them. You roll [[+Weird]] to cast it, as you would when **using magic** normally.

You start out knowing up to one rote, which you can choose when creating your character or during play. You can learn more by taking [[improvements]]—when you do, you can choose the new rote right away or in play.

## Temptation

You have a dangerous drive that you pursue, sometimes to the exclusion of your own safety. Decide if your Temptation drove you to learn magic, or if learning magic drove you to it.

Whenever you give in to your Temptation and act accordingly, you mark experience. You need to **[[act under pressure]]** to resist giving in to your temptation, if a perfect opportunity presents itself; if you fail this roll, you don’t mark experience like you would have if you’d willingly acted out your desires.

Choose one Temptation: b **Vengeance:** [[Use Magic]] to inflict disproportionate retribution on someone who wronged you.

b **Power:** [[Use Magic]] to exert your dominance over another. b **Addiction:** [[Use Magic]] to do what you could do without it. b **Callousness:** [[Use Magic]] without regard for the safety of others.

b **Carnage:** [[Use Magic]] to inflict gruesome violence.

b **Secrets:** [[Use Magic]] to discover forbidden, dangerous knowledge.

b **Glory:** [[Use Magic]] to steal someone’s thunder.

## Moves

You have three Hex [[moves]]. You have this one:

B **Bad Luck Charm**: Whenever you **[[use magic]]** and miss, the backlash never affects you directly if there’s someone else around to hit. It’ll go for allies, other hunters, and innocent [[bystanders]]. Sometimes, every so often, it might even hit an enemy.

Plus pick two of these:

b **Burn Everything**: When you **[[use magic]]** to inflict [[harm]], you can choose to inflict 3-[[harm]] area magic obvious or 3-[[harm]] ignore-[[armour]] magic obvious. b **Cast the Bones**: Once per mystery, you may perform some kind of divination (tarot, casting the runes, reading entrails, or something like that) to glean information about the future. When you seek guidance by divination, roll [[+Sharp]]. On a 10+, [[hold]] 2. On a 7-9, [[hold]] 1. On a miss, you get some information, but it’s not what you want to hear. Spend those holds to ask any question from the **[[investigate a mystery]]** move, or one of the following questions:

-   What can I gain from this person/place/thing/creature?

-   Who has touched this person/place/thing/creature before me? [[The Keeper]] will answer truthfully, with either a direct answer or how to find out more.

b **Force of Will**: When you apply your will to dispelling a magical effect, blocking a spell, or suspending a Phenomenon, roll [[+Weird]]. On a hit, momentary magics are cancelled completely, and long-lasting spells and effects are suspended temporarily. On a 10+, you can also spend Luck to instantly snuff out a powerful spell or strange effect. On a 7-9, you take 1-[[harm]] as the strain of dismissing magic unravels you. b **Luck of the Damned**: After you **[[use magic]]** or cast a rote, take +1 [[forward]] on the next roll you make. b **Sympathetic Token**: As long as you carry a personal object belonging to someone, such as a lock of hair, a full set of toenails, or a treasured family heirloom, you get +1 [[ongoing]] to **[[use magic]]** against them. You can also **[[use magic]]** against them at a distance. If you try to **[[use magic]]** against them and miss, the token is lost, destroyed, or loses its power.

b **This Might Sting**: You can **[[use magic]]** to heal 3-[[harm]], but the process is exceptionally painful. On a 7-9 it also leaves a gnarly scar.

b **Wise Soul**: Whenever you **[[use magic]]**, right before you roll, you can ask [[the Keeper]] what exactly would happen on a miss. If you dislike the risk, you can stop at the last second, and let the spell fizzle harmlessly. All of the effort is wasted.

## Gear

You have whatever magical items or amulets you use to perform magic, including whatever you need to cast your rotes. You also have two wizardly [[weapons]].

**Wizardly [[weapons]], pick two:**

b .38 revolver b Athame b Crossbow (2-[[harm]] close (2-[[harm]] hand (2-[[harm]] reload loud) magic silver) close slow)

b Shotgun b Shillelagh b Staff (1-[[harm]] (3-[[harm]] close (1-[[harm]] hand hand balanced messy loud) balanced) large) **[[Introductions]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Hex by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

-   You once cast a powerful spell or curse on them. Tell them why, and ask them how it ended.

-   They fear your power, or what you might do with it. Ask them why.

-   You’re madly in love with them. Ask them if they can tell.

-   They encourage you to indulge your temptation. Ask them why.

-   They keep you grounded, and are unfazed by your displays of power.

-   You were part of the same cult, sect, or secret society. Decide together what horrible things you did in the name of power.

-   You learned through divination that they’re important and you should help them. Decide whether you’ve told them or not.

-   They helped you out when a spell went awry. Tell them what the spell was, and ask them how they helped you.

## Luck

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Hex Special**: When you spend Luck, until the end of the mystery, backlash on your spells will be extra nasty.

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list.

## Improvements

b Get +1 Weird, max +3. b Take another Rote. b Get +1 Cool, max +2. b Take another Rote. b Get +1 Charm, max +2. b Take another Rote. b Get +1 Sharp, max +2. b Take another Hex move, or an additional Rote. b Take another Hex move, or an additional Rote. b Take a Haven, like [[The Expert]] has, with two options. b Take a move from another playbook.

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED [[IMprovements]]** b Get +1 to any rating, max +3. b Change this hunter to a new type. b Make up a second hunter to play as well as this one.

b Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced. b Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.

b Retire this hunter to safety.

b Erase one used Luck mark from your playbook.

b Gain another two Rotes. b Choose one advanced Hex move (see below).

## Advanced Hex Moves

When you take the “Choose one advanced Hex move” improvement, choose one of these [[moves]]. You can never have both:

b **Apotheosis**: You become a terrifying fount of mystical power. Once per mystery, after you suffer loss or [[harm]], you may enter a state where you have both immense power and zero interest in the well-being of other people. While in this state, you can fly, use [[+Weird]] to **[[kick some ass]]** instead of [[+Tough]] (using innate magic as a 3-[[harm]] weapon with whatever properties you choose), ignore the component costs of your rotes, ignore one requirement of every spell you cast with **[[use magic]]**, and you have +1 [[ongoing]] to do everything. On the other hand, you outright cannot use the **[[protect someone]]** move, you have all the Temptations, and you have to indulge them whenever a good opportunity presents itself. When you try to resist a temptation, roll [[+Cool]]. On a 10+, your apotheosis ends. On a 7-9, it ends with you doing something dangerous or cruel. On a miss, it ends only after you [[harm]] someone (or something) you love.

b **Synthesis**: You manage to conciliate your dark power with your moral impulses. You lose your Temptation. Whenever you **[[use magic]]** to **[[help out]]** or **[[protect someone]]**, you mark experience. Mark a second experience if you do it at the expense of your own safety.
