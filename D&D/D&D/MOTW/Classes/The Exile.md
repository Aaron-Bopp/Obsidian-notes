## Introductions 

 When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together. Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Exile by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you. 

## History 

 Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters: 

- This hunter is a distant descendant in your family line. 

- This hunter was the first to take you in, explain the modern world, and learn about your origins. Work out how you managed to communicate (perhaps you speak a common language, or ancient and modern versions of the same one). 

- This hunter belongs to an organisation that existed in your home time. Decide between you what your relationship was with that group, and how you’ll be remembered by them. 

- This hunter showed understanding when you were [[confused]] and overwhelmed. 

- When you met, you immediately liked and respected each other. 

- This hunter possesses a message or item left for you by your comrades in the past. Tell them what it is and ask how it came into their possession. 

- This hunter had a vision, premonition, or proph- ecy that mentioned you. Tell them what the vision showed them about you. 

- You both became hunters because of the same sort of monster attacked you or your kin. Decide between you what it was.
