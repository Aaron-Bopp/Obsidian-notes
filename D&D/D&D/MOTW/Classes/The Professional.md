*It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down [[monsters]]. Still, that’s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”*

To make your Professional, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Agency, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Professional by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- Your relationship with them has romantic potential. So [[far]] it hasn’t gone further.
- They’re on the Agency’s watch list, and you’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- You are related. Tell them how [[close]].
- You met on a mission and worked together unofficially. And successfully.
- They’ve worked with the Agency before, and they’re well regarded.
- You were friends back in training, before the Agency recruited you. This could be military, law enforcement, or some weirder school: decide the details between you.
- They pulled you (and maybe your team) out of a terrible FUBARed mission.
- You got sent to “deal with them” as a hazard to the Agency’s policies one time. Tell them how you resolved this.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your [[Luck]] boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.
