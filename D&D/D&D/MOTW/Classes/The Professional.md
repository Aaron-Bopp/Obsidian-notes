*It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down [[monsters]]. Still, that’s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”*

To make your Professional, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Agency, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG13.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, concealed.
- Chiseled face, scarred face, unshaven face, soft face, young face, old face, determined face.
- Tailored suit, shabby suit, perfect suit, utility coveralls, battledress, paramilitary uniform, lab coat.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm=0, Cool+2, Sharp-1, Tough+2, Weird-1
- Charm-1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird=0
- Charm+1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird=0
- Charm-1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+1
- Charm=0, Cool+2, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird-1

**AGENCY**

Decide who it is you work for. Are they a black-budget government department, a secret military unit, a clandestine police team, a private individual’s crusade, a corporation, a scientific team, or what?

Is the Agency’s goal to: destroy [[monsters]], study the supernatural, protect people, gain power, or something else?

Pick two resource tags for the Agency, and two red tape tags:

**Resources** (pick two):

- Well-armed
- Well-financed
- Rigorous training
- Official pull
- Cover identities
- Offices all over the place
- Good intel
- Recognised authority
- Weird tech gadgets
- Support teams

**Red Tape** (pick two):

- Dubious motives
- Bureaucratic
- Secretive hierarchy
- Cryptic missions
- Hostile superiors
- Inter-departmental rivalry
- Budget cuts
- Take no prisoners policy
- Live capture policy

**[[MOVES]]**

*You get all the basic [[moves]], plus four Professional [[moves]].*

*You get this one:*

- When you **deal with the Agency,** requesting help or [[gear]], or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for [[gear]] or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.

*Then pick three of these:*

- **Bottle It Up**: If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you **[[Act Under Pressure]]**. For each +1 you use, [[the Keeper]] holds 1. That [[hold]] can be spent later—one for one—to give you -1 on any move *except* **[[Act Under Pressure]]**.
- **Unfazeable**: Take +1 Cool (max +3).
- **Battlefield Awareness**: You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 [[armour]] (max 2-[[armour]]) on top of whatever you get from your [[gear]].
- **Leave No One Behind**: In combat, when **you help someone escape**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can *either* get them out *or* suffer no [[harm]], you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention.
- **Tactical Genius**: When you **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, you may roll +Cool instead of +Sharp
- **Medic**: You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. **When you do first aid**, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 [[harm]]. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 [[harm]] or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 [[harm]]. This move takes the place of regular first aid.
- **Mobility**: You have a truck, van, or car built for monster hunting. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it. 

*Good things*: roomy; surveillance [[gear]]; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed [[weapons]]; anonymous; armoured (+1 [[armour]] inside); tough; monster cage.

*Bad things*: loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-  guzzler; uncomfortable; slow; old.

**[[GEAR]]**

Pick one serious weapon and two normal [[weapons]].

You get *either* a flak vest (1-[[armour]] hidden) *or* combat [[armour]] (2-[[armour]] heavy) for protection.

Serious [[weapons]] (pick one):

- Assault rifle (3-[[harm]] far area loud reload)
- Grenade launcher (4-[[harm]] far area messy loud reload)
- Sniper rifle (4-[[harm]] far)
- Grenades (4-[[harm]] close area messy loud)
- Submachine gun (3-[[harm]] close area loud reload)

Normal [[weapons]] (pick two):

- .38 revolver (2-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-[[harm]] close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-[[harm]] far loud)
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] close messy)
- Big knife (1-[[harm]] hand)

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Professional by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- Your relationship with them has romantic potential. So far it hasn’t gone further.
- They’re on the Agency’s watch list, and you’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- You are related. Tell them how close.
- You met on a mission and worked together unofficially. And successfully.
- They’ve worked with the Agency before, and they’re well regarded.
- You were friends back in training, before the Agency recruited you. This could be military, law enforcement, or some weirder school: decide the details between you.
- They pulled you (and maybe your team) out of a terrible FUBARed mission.
- You got sent to “deal with them” as a hazard to the Agency’s policies one time. Tell them how you resolved this.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your Luck boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Cool, max +3
- Get +1 Charm, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Get +1 Tough, max +2
- Take another Professional move
- Take another Professional move
- Add a new resource tag for your Agency *or* change a red tape tag
- Get command of an Agency team of monster hunters
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Get some or all of the other players’ hunters hired by your agency. They get the **deal with the agency** move, as well as salary and benefits.
