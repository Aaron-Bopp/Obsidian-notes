# The Hard Case 

> I’ve fought anything that you can fight, and won. Now I found [[monsters]] needing a beatdown, and there ain’t nobody can give ‘em the thrashing I can. Stand back, I got this. 

## Luck 

Mark [[luck]] to change a roll to 12 or avoid all [[harm]] from an injury. 

 Okay [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Doomed 

**Hard Case special** : When you spend a point of [[Luck]], someone you fought in the past is going to turn up. Did you part as enemies or with respect? 

## Harm 

When you reach 4 or more, mark [[unstable]]. 

Okay [ ][ ][ ]|[ ][ ][ ][ ] Dying [[Unstable]]: [ ] 

## Experience 

 Experience: [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] 

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Hard Knocks 

 You had a long, harsh schooling to get as hard as you are. What was it? Pick one: 
 - **[[Bodyguard]]** : When you spend 1 [[Fire]] to [[protect someone]] , as well as +1 [[forward]], you may protect them even if they are out of reach or the [[harm]] they are about to suffer would be [[unstoppable]]. Get an ally group of old colleagues: good at protecting people. Get the “concealed [[armour]]” [[gear]] pick.
 - **Enforcer** : Spend 1 [[Fire]] to look so scary that it counts as a reason for manipulating someone. After you roll, if you terrify them, spend [[Fire]] 1-for-1 to increase your result. Gain an ally who can help with money, disguises, back you up, or get underworld gossip. Get the “bag of cash” [[gear]] pick.
 - **Secret Martial Art** : Spend [[Fire]] 1-for-1 to increase [[harm]] inflicted by your unarmed attacks. Your unarmed attacks gain [[ignore-armour]]. Get an ally, a [[mentor]] or student: good in a fight or philosophical discussion. Get the “ancient sword” [[gear]] pick.
 - **Military** : When you’re using military [[gear]] on a move, you may spend 2 [[Fire]] to boost the result level (a miss becomes a 7-9, 7-9 becomes 10+, or 10+ becomes 12+). You have an ally group, your old comrades: good in a fight or when you need help making preparations. Get the “battered assault rifle” [[gear]] pick.
 - **Resistance** : What was your cause? You have contacts amongst sympathetic activists. If you need help and it fits the cause, call on them. Roll +[[Charm]]. On a 10+ they will help. On a 7-9 they’ll help you but then you have to help them. On a miss, they help but you get drawn into their trouble. You may spend 2-[[Fire]] instead of rolling; you rouse them and they’ll help as if you rolled 10+. Gain an ally, an old comrade from the movement. Get the “spell formula” [[gear]] pick.
 - **Street Fighter** : When you have an ally standing by your side, spend 1-[[Fire]] to add +2 [[harm]] when you inflict [[harm]]. If there are multiple allies at your side, you may spend [[Fire]] for each. Gain an ally, an old friend you can count on for anything. Get the “firewater” [[gear]] pick.
