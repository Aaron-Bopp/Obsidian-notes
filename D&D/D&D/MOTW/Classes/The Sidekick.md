# The SidEKick 

 I don’t know much about the occult or [[monsters]], or this whole deal. But I found a Hero. Someone better than me. They need a [[hand]] now and then, to do the heroic stuff. Someday, maybe, I can be a big damn hero too. 

## Luck 

Mark [[luck]] to change a roll to 12 or avoid all [[harm]] from an injury.

**Sidekick special** : Whenever you spend a [[Luck]] point, you’ll get a chance to do something heroic. 

## Harm 

When you reach 4 or more, mark [[unstable]]. 

 Okay [ ][ ][ ]|[ ][ ][ ][ ] Dying [[Unstable]]: [ ]

---

## Getting Started 

 To make your Sidekick, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions in this playbook to decide your hero, look, ratings, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]]. 

## Hero 

 Pick one of the other hunters to be your hero. This is the person you decided is such an awesome monster hunter that you are going to spend your time helping them out. Think about the hero and decide what your relationship is. Perhaps they’re an older sibling, a parent, a friend who was always better than you, perhaps they saved you from a monster, or you found out about their monster hunting by accident. Check with the hero’s player, to make sure they’re okay with it. When your hero’s player has picked their ratings, ask them which is highest. You’ve been trying to be like them, so you get an extra +1 to that rating. If they have a tie for highest, you can pick which one you put your +1 on. Pronouns: _______________________ 

## Look 

Check your hero’s choices in their playbook. Pick one from each line from that playbook, and copy at least one of the choices they made. ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ ________________________________________________ 

## Ratings, pick one line: 


 - [[Charm]] +1, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] 0, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1
 - [[Charm]] +1, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] 0
 - [[Charm]] +1, [[Cool]] 0, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1
 - [[Charm]] 0, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1
 - [[Charm]] +1, [[Cool]] 0, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1 Remember to take +1 on your hero’s best rating as well! 

## Introductions 

 When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together. Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Sidekick by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you. 

## History 

 Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters: 

- (For the hero) This hunter is your hero. 

- This hunter makes you a bit jealous of their relation- ship with your hero. 

- This hunter has been your friend for [[many]] years. Where did you meet? 

- This hunter bonded with you after defeating a monster together, the first time you worked as a team. What was it? 

- This hunter knew you back when you were a nobody. Tell them something about the person you used to    be, something you’re now ashamed of. 

- This hunter introduced you to your hero. 

- This hunter saved your life when you were distracted, so you owe them big time. 

- This hunter’s pretty great, they could have almost been your hero. Tell them why they’re not quite as good. 

## Leveling Up 

 When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the list below.
