## Getting Started 

To make your Snoop, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions in this playbook to decide your look, ratings, crew, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]]. Pronouns: _______________________ 

## Look, pick one from each List: 

- Slender body, hefty body, trim body, jittery body, tall body, short body, ________________ body. 

- Student clothes, arty clothes, old suit, stylish suit, safari wear, hat & trenchcoat, utility wear, _________________ clothes. 

## Ratings, pick one line: 


 - [[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] -1, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] 0, [[Weird]] +1
 - [[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] 0, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1
 - [[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] +1, [[Tough]] 0, [[Weird]] -1
 - [[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] -1, [[Sharp]] +2, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] 0
 - [[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] 0, [[Tough]] -1, [[Weird]] +1 

## Crew 

 Decide if your crew is the other hunters, or if you have an entourage. If they are not [[the hunters]], there are up to three of them. Pick a name and job for each. Tell [[the Keeper]]–your crew are [[bystanders]]. If it’s the other hunters, decide together who gets which job. Crew jobs: camera, sound, editing, dogsbody, researcher, driver, director, producer, [[bodyguard]]. 

## Team Concept: Monster Revelations 

This is a [[quick]] example series setup based around the Snoop. The team has an Internet video channel, Monster Revelations,” that covers their monster hunts and teaches viewers about the [[monsters]] that are really out there. A Snoop is required to run things; a Flake or Expert makes a good researcher; a Mundane can make the coffee; everyone else can [[hold]] a camera or microphone or carry things. 

## Introductions 

 When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together. Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Snoop by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you. 

## History 

 Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters: 

- You’re best friends from school/university (film class, maybe?) 

- You met this hunter when they killed a monster you were doing a story on. Ask them what it was. 

- This hunter almost defeated a monster but you did something to prevent that. Ask them what the monster was, then tell them what you did. Was it an accident or on purpose? 

- This hunter was in danger of some having unhelpful publicity, but you got the story killed. 

- You have a crush on this hunter. Ask them if they’ve noticed. 

- This hunter saved your ass when you did something stupid. Ask them what you did. 

- This hunter is a huge fan of your work. Ask them if they keep quiet about it or if everyone knows? 

- This hunter is a relation, [[close]] or distant. Decide between you exactly what.
