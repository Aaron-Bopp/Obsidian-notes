*Fight [[fire]] with **[[fire]] [[magic]]**.*

To make your Spell-slinger, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Combat [[Magic]], [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG14.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Woman, man, androgynous.
- Rumpled clothes, stylish clothes, goth clothes, old fashioned clothes.
- Shadowed eyes, fierce eyes, weary eyes, sparkling eyes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]=0, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]=0, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+2

## **COMBAT MAGIC**


You have a few attack spells you can use as [[weapons]]. When you use these spells to **[[Kick Some Ass]]**, roll +[[Weird]] instead of +[[Tough]]. Sometimes the situation may require you to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to cast your spell without problems.

Pick three options from the list below.

Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells with any of your effects.

Combat [[magic]], pick three (with at least one base):

**Bases:**

- **Blast**: 2-[[harm]] magical [[close]] obvious [[loud]]
- **Ball**: 1-[[harm]] magical [[area]] [[close]] obvious [[loud]]
- **Missile**: 1-[[harm]] magical [[far]] obvious [[loud]]
- **Wall**: 1-[[harm]] magical [[barrier]] [[close]] 1-[[armour]] obvious [[loud]]

**Effects:**

- **[[Fire]]**: Add “+2 [[harm]] [[fire]]” to a base. If you get a 10+ on a combat [[magic]] roll, the [[fire]] won’t spread.
- **Force or Wind**: Add “+1 [[harm]] [[forceful]]” to a base, or “+1 [[armour]]” to a wall.
- **Lightning or Entropy**: Add “+1 [[harm]] [[messy]]” to a base.
- **Frost or Ice**: Adds “-1 [[harm]] +2 [[armour]]” to a wall, or “+1 [[harm]] [[restraining]]” to other bases.
- **Earth**: Add “[[forceful]] [[restraining]]” to a base.
- **Necromantic**: Add “[[life-drain]]” to a base.

## **[[MOVES]]**


You get all the basic [[moves]] and four Spell-slinger [[moves]]. You have this one:

- ![[Tools and Techniques]]
- ![[Consumables]]
- ![[Foci]]
- ![[Gestures]]
- ![[Incantations]]
- ![[Advanced Arcane Training]]
- ![[Arcane Reputation]]
- ![[Could’ve Been Worse]]
- ![[Enchanted Clothing]]
- ![[Forensic Divination]]
- ![[Go Big or Go Home]]
- ![[Not My Fault]]
- ![[Practitioner]]
- ![[Shield Spell]]
- ![[Third Eye]]
## **[[GEAR]]**


You don’t need much—aside from any [[Foci]] or [[Consumables]] to power your [[magic]]. Still, it’s good to carry some backup. Pick one:

- Old revolver (2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[reload]] [[loud]])
- Ritual knife (1-[[harm]] [[hand]])
- Heirloom sword (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]])

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Spell-slinger by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They act as your conscience when the power goes to your head. Ask them about the last time this happened.
- Blood relation, though you were out of contact for years. Ask them how they reconnected with you.
- [[Mentor]] from another life. Ask them what they taught you.
- Your [[magic]]-fueled rescue of them introduced them to the supernatural. Tell them what creature was after them.
- An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship. Tell them what you once fought over.
- You thought they were dead, and now they’re back. What “killed” them?
- They’re an on-again/off-again love interest. Ask them what keeps you apart. Tell them what keeps you together.
- A comrade-in-arms. You’ve faced the biggest threats together.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Tough]], max +2
- Take another Spell-Slinger move.
- Take another Spell-Slinger move.
- Take a move from another playbook.
- Take a move from another playbook.
- Take another Combat [[Magic]] pick.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below:

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Erase one used [[Luck]] mark from your playbook.
- Take another Combat [[Magic]] pick.
- You may cross off another option from your [[Tools and Techniques]].
