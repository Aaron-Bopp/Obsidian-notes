*Fight fire with **fire magic**.*

To make your Spell-slinger, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Combat Magic, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG14.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Woman, man, androgynous.
- Rumpled clothes, stylish clothes, goth clothes, old fashioned clothes.
- Shadowed eyes, fierce eyes, weary eyes, sparkling eyes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm-1, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird+2
- Charm-1, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2

**COMBAT MAGIC**

You have a few attack spells you can use as [[weapons]]. When you use these spells to **[[kick some ass]]**, roll [[+Weird]] instead of [[+Tough]]. Sometimes the situation may require you to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to cast your spell without problems.

Pick three options from the list below.

Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells with any of your effects.

Combat magic, pick three (with at least one base):

**Bases:**

- **Blast**: 2-[[harm]] magical close obvious loud
- **Ball**: 1-[[harm]] magical area close obvious loud
- **Missile**: 1-[[harm]] magical far obvious loud
- **Wall**: 1-[[harm]] magical barrier close 1-[[armour]] obvious loud

**Effects:**

- **Fire**: Add “+2 [[harm]] fire” to a base. If you get a 10+ on a combat magic roll, the fire won’t spread.
- **Force or Wind**: Add “+1 [[harm]] forceful” to a base, or “+1 [[armour]]” to a wall.
- **Lightning or Entropy**: Add “+1 [[harm]] messy” to a base.
- **Frost or Ice**: Adds “-1 [[harm]] +2 [[armour]]” to a wall, or “+1 [[harm]] restraining” to other bases.
- **Earth**: Add “forceful restraining” to a base.
- **Necromantic**: Add “life-drain” to a base.

**[[MOVES]]**

You get all the basic [[moves]] and four Spell-slinger [[moves]]. You have this one:

- **Tools and Techniques**: In order to use your combat magic effectively, you rely on a collection of tools and techniques. If you don’t use them, there are drawbacks. Cross off one; you’ll need the rest.
- **Consumables**: You need to have certain supplies— powders, oils, etc— on hand to cast your spell. They’re used up when you cast the spell. If you don’t have them on hand, your body will be the substitute: take 1-[[harm]] ignore-[[armour]] when you cast.
- **Foci**: You need wands, staves, and other somewhat obvious props to focus your efforts at their most powerful. If you don’t have what you need on hand, your combat magic does 1 less [[harm]].
- **Gestures**: You need to be able to wave your hands around obviously in order to use your combat magic. If you’re restrained in any way, you can still cast the spell but it’s more likely to go wrong; take -1 [[ongoing]] to your combat magic.
- **Incantations**: You must speak in an arcane language to control your magic without it filtering directly through your mind. If you use combat magic spell, successfully or failed, while unable or unwilling to speak, you must immediately **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to avoid scrambling your thoughts—producing hallucinations, sensory deprivation, and general befuddlement.

Plus pick three of these:

- **Advanced Arcane Training**: If you have two of your three Tools and Techniques at the ready, you may ignore the third one.
- **Arcane Reputation**: Pick three big organizations or groups in the supernatural community, which can include some of the more sociable types of [[monsters]]. They’ve heard of you and respect your power. With affected humans, take +1 [[forward]] when you **manipulate** them. You may **manipulate** affected [[monsters]] as if they were human, with no bonus.
- **Could’ve Been Worse**: When you miss a **[[Use Magic]]** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic: 
  - **Fizzle**: The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You’ll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.
  - **This Is Gonna Suck**: The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.
- **Enchanted Clothing**: Pick an article of every-day clothing–it’s enchanted without any change in appearance. Take -1 [[harm]] from any source that tries to get at you through the garment.
- **Forensic Divination**: When you successfully **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**, you may ask “What magic was done here?” as a free extra question.
- **Go Big or Go Home**: When you must **[[Use Magic]]** as a requirement for [[Big Magic]], take +1 [[ongoing]] to those **[[Use Magic]]** rolls.
- **Not My Fault**: +1 to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** when you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting.
- **Practitioner**: Choose two effects available to you under **[[Use Magic]]**. Take +1 to **[[Use Magic]]** whenever you choose one of those effects.
- **Shield Spell**: When you **[[Protect Someone]]**, gain 2-[[armour]] against any [[harm]] that is transferred to you. This doesn’t stack with your other [[armour]], if any.
- **Third Eye**: When you **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 [[hold]] on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 [[hold]], but you’re exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!

**[[GEAR]]**

You don’t need much—aside from any foci or consumables to power your magic. Still, it’s good to carry some backup. Pick one:

- Old revolver (2-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- Ritual knife (1-[[harm]] hand)
- Heirloom sword (2-[[harm]] hand messy)

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Spell-slinger by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They act as your conscience when the power goes to your head. Ask them about the last time this happened.
- Blood relation, though you were out of contact for years. Ask them how they reconnected with you.
- Mentor from another life. Ask them what they taught you.
- Your magic-fueled rescue of them introduced them to the supernatural. Tell them what creature was after them.
- An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship. Tell them what you once fought over.
- You thought they were dead, and now they’re back. What “killed” them?
- They’re an on-again/off-again love interest. Ask them what keeps you apart. Tell them what keeps you together.
- A comrade-in-arms. You’ve faced the biggest threats together.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Weird, max +3
- Get +1 Cool, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Get +1 Tough, max +2
- Take another Spell-Slinger move.
- Take another Spell-Slinger move.
- Take a move from another playbook.
- Take a move from another playbook.
- Take another Combat Magic pick.

**ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below:

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Erase one used Luck mark from your playbook.
- Take another Combat Magic pick.
- You may cross off another option from your Tools and Techniques.
