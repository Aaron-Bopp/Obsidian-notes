## Moves

You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus three Searcher [[moves]]. You get this one:

- **First Encounter**: One strange event started you down this path, sparking your need to discover the truth behind the unexplained. Decide what that event was: pick a category below and take the associated move. Then tell everyone what happened to you (or someone close to you). Then pick a category below and take the associated move: b **Cryptid Sighting**: You take note of any reports of strange creatures. Whenever you first see a new type of creature, you may immediately ask one of the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** questions. b **Zone of Strangeness**: Things are not fixed. You never need **[[Act Under Pressure]]** when supernatural forces alter the environment around you, and you get 2-[[armour]] against [[harm]] from sudden changes to the laws of physics.

- **Psychic Event**: Your mind is awakened. You may **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to use the **sensitive** weird move, or—if **sensitive** is your weird move—**empath**. See page 21. b **Higher power**: Something looks out for you. You start with an extra Luck.

- **Strange Dangers**: You are always watching for hazards. When you have no [[armour]], you still count as having 1-[[armour]].

- **Abduction**: They taught you hidden knowledge. Gain +1 to any move when you research strange or ancient secrets to do it.

- **Cosmic Insight**: You have encompassed the soul of the universe. You never need to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** due to feelings of fear, despair, or isolation.

Then pick two of these:

- **Prepared to Defend**: Even truth seekers need to fight some times. Whenever you suffer [[harm]] when you **[[kick some ass]]** or **[[Protect Someone]]**, you suffer 1-[[harm]] less. b **Fellow Believer**: People understand you’ve also known strangeness. [[Bystanders]] will talk to you about weird things they would not trust another hunter (or a mundane official) to believe. b **Guardian**: You have a mystical ally (perhaps a spirit, alien, or cryptid) who helps and defends you. Define them, and their powers, with [[the Keeper]]’s agreement. Their look is one of: invisible, an intangible spirit thing, a weird creature, disguised as an animal, or disguised as a person.

- **Just Another Day**: When you have to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** due to a monster, phenomenon, or mystical effect, you may roll +Weird instead of [[+Cool]]. b **Network**: You may gain an ally group of others who had experiences similar to your first encounter—perhaps they’re a support group or hobbyist club. Detail up to five members with useful skills related to what happened to them (none are up for fighting [[monsters]]).

- **Ockham’s Broadsword**: When you first encounter something strange, you may ask [[the Keeper]] what sort of thing it is. They will tell you if it (or the cause) is: natural, an unnatural creature, a weird phenomenon, or a person. You gain +1 [[forward]] dealing with it.

- **The Things I’ve Seen**: When you encounter a creature or phenomenon, you may declare that you have seen it before. [[The Keeper]] may ask you some questions about that encounter, and will then tell you one useful fact you learned and one danger you need to watch out for (maybe right now).

## Gear

You get a laptop, a car or motorcycle, a camera, binoculars, two sets of investigation tools, and one self-defence weapon. **Investigation tools, pick two:**

- A bag of cameras & b Historical documents microphones. and witness reports

- Forensic tools. of strange events.

- Ghost hunting tools. b Maps, blueprints, and b Scientific measuring tools. building reports for b Cryptid hunting [[gear]]. significant places.

**Self-defence [[weapons]], pick one:**

- Walking stick (1-[[harm]] hand innocuous).

- Small handgun (2-[[harm]] close reload loud).

- Small knife (1-[[harm]] hand messy).

## Introductions

- Martial arts training (1-[[harm]] hand innocuous).

- Incapacitating spray  (0-[[harm]] hand irritating).

- Heavy flashlight (1-[[harm]] hand innocuous).

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Searcher by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

-   In your researches, you found accounts (and pictures) of someone matching their description perfectly, but long before they were born. Tell them if you have mentioned this.

-   A relative. Decide between you how close.

-   They were involved in a supernatural event similar to your first encounter. Perhaps it was the same event, or perhaps you investigated their event later. Ask them how the event affected them.

-   You figured out a supernatural or weird secret they keep. Ask them what it is.

-   You met when you were each investigating seperate mysteries. Tell them what trick you used to protect them from weirdness and ask them how they saved you from a danger.

-   You’re both veterans of a therapy or support group or a treatment program. Work out the details between you.

-   Some creature or force is stalking them. Ask them what it is. Then decide if you’ve told them about it or if they are still happily unaware.

-   You found their pet when it went missing. Where had it gone?


## Luck

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Searcher Special**: When you spend a point of Luck, your first encounter comes up in play. It could be a flashback, new occurrence, or related event.

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list.

## Improvements
<table><colgroup><col style="width: 56%" /><col style="width: 43%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p>b Get +1 Sharp, max +3 b Get +1 Weird, max +3 b Get +1 Charm, max +2 b Get +1 Cool, max +2 b Take another</p><p>Searcher move b Take another</p><blockquote><p>Searcher move</p></blockquote></th><th><p>b Gain an ally.</p><p>b Take a second <strong>first encounter</strong> move, based on a recent mystery. b Take a move from another playbook</p><p>b Take a move from another playbook.</p></th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>
