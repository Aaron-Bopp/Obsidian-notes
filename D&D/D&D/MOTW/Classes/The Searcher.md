## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- In your researches, you found accounts (and pictures) of someone matching their description perfectly, but long before they were born. Tell them if you have mentioned this.

- A relative. Decide between you how [[close]].

- They were involved in a supernatural event similar to your [[First Encounter]]. Perhaps it was the same event, or perhaps you investigated their event later. Ask them how the event affected them.

- You figured out a supernatural or [[Weird]] secret they keep. Ask them what it is.

- You met when you were each investigating seperate mysteries. Tell them what trick you used to protect them from weirdness and ask them how they saved you from a danger.

- You’re both veterans of a therapy or support group or a treatment program. Work out the details between you.

- Some creature or force is stalking them. Ask them what it is. Then decide if you’ve told them about it or if they are still happily unaware.

- You found their pet when it went missing. Where had it gone?

## Luck

You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Searcher Special**: When you spend a point of [[Luck]], your [[First Encounter]] comes up in play. It could be a flashback, new occurrence, or related event.
