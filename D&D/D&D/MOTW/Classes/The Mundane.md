*You heard about how [[monsters]] only pick on people with crazy powers who can fight back on even terms? Yeah, me neither. But, hell, I ended up in this monster-hunting team so I gotta do what I can, right?*

To make your Mundane, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG12.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, androgynous, concealed.
- Friendly face, alluring face, laughing face, trustworthy face, average face, serious face, sensual face.
- Normal clothes, casual clothes, goth clothes, sporty clothes, work clothes, street clothes, nerdy clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp=0, Tough+1, Weird-1
- Charm+2, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird=0
- Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp-1, Tough+1, Weird+1
- Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird-1
- Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird-1

**[[MOVES]]**

*You get all the basic [[moves]], plus pick three Mundane [[moves]]:*

- **Always The Victim**: When another hunter uses **[[protect someone]]** to protect you, they mark experience. Whenever a monster captures you, you mark experience.
- **Oops!** If **you want to stumble across something important**, tell [[the Keeper]]. You will find something important and useful, although not necessarily related to your immediate problems.
- **Let’s Get Out Of Here!** If you can **[[protect someone]]** by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll [[+Charm]] instead of [[+Tough]].
- **Panic Button**: When you need to escape, **name the route you’ll try** and roll [[+Sharp]]. On a 10+ you’re out of danger, no problem. On a 7-9 you can go or stay, but if you go it’s going to cost you (you leave something behind or something comes with you). On a miss, you are caught halfway out.
- **The Power of Heart**: When fighting a monster, if you **help someone**, don’t roll [[+Cool]]. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.
- **Trust Me**: When **you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger**, roll [[+Charm]]. On a 10+ they’ll do what you say they should, no questions asked. On a 7-9 they do it, but [[the Keeper]] chooses one from: 
  - They ask you a hard question first.
  - They stall and dither a while.
  - They have a “better” idea.

On a miss, they’re going to think you’re crazy and maybe dangerous too.

- **What Could Go Wrong?**: Whenever you **charge into immediate danger** without hedging your bets, [[hold]] 2. You may spend your [[hold]] to: 
  - Inflict +1 [[harm]].
  - Reduce someone’s [[harm]] suffered by 1.
  - Take +2 [[forward]] on an **[[act under pressure]]** roll.
- **Don’t Worry, I’ll Check It Out**: Whenever **you go off by yourself** to check out somewhere (or something) scary, mark experience.

**[[GEAR]]**

You get two Mundane [[weapons]] and a means of transport.

Mundane [[weapons]] (pick two):

- Golf club, baseball bat, cricket bat, or hockey stick (2-[[harm]] hand innocuous messy)
- Pocket knife or multitool (1-[[harm]] hand useful small)
- Small handgun (2-[[harm]] close loud reload)
- Hunting rifle (3-[[harm]] far loud reload)
- Sledge-hammer or fire axe (3-[[harm]] hand messy)
- Nunchuks (2-[[harm]] hand area)

Means of transport (pick one):

- Skateboard
- Bicycle
- Fairly new car in decent condition
- Classic car in terrible condition
- Motorcycle
- Van

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Mundane by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- You are close relations. Tell them exactly how you’re related.
- Initially rivals, you both now respect each others’ talents.
- Romantically involved, or you just have a crush on them. Ask them which they prefer.
- They’re your hero, exactly the kind of monster hunter you aspire to be. Tell them why you worship them.
- Good friends. Tell them if it’s from way back, or recently.
- You’re a bit suspicious of them (maybe due to their unnatural powers or something like that).
- They introduced you to the existence of [[monsters]]. Tell them how you feel about that.
- You saved their life from a monster due to an unlikely chain of events. Tell them what.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your Luck boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Charm, max +3
- Get +1 Cool, max +2

- Get +1 Tough, max +2
