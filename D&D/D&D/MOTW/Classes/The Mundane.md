*You heard about how [[monsters]] only pick on people with crazy powers who can fight back on even terms? Yeah, me neither. But, hell, I ended up in this monster-hunting team so I gotta do what I can, right?*

To make your Mundane, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Mundane by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- You are [[close]] relations. Tell them exactly how you’re related.
- Initially rivals, you both now respect each others’ talents.
- Romantically involved, or you just have a crush on them. Ask them which they prefer.
- They’re your hero, exactly the kind of monster hunter you aspire to be. Tell them why you worship them.
- Good friends. Tell them if it’s from way back, or recently.
- You’re a bit suspicious of them (maybe due to their unnatural powers or something like that).
- They introduced you to the existence of [[monsters]]. Tell them how you feel about that.
- You saved their life from a monster due to an unlikely chain of events. Tell them what.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your [[Luck]] boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Charm]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2

- Get back one used [[Luck]] point

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.
