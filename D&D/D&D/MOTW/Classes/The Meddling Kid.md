#NPC # [[Moves]] 

 You get all the basic [[moves]], plus three Meddling Kid [[moves]]. Pick three of these:
 - **Unmasked!:** When you have a monster captured or at bay, you may explain it is not a monster after all but a specific person in a mask. You must explain the real reason for all the seemingly supernatural events you have seen, and how the villain was behind them. When you reveal the culprit , roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+, your deduction is correct and it really is that person in a mask! On a 7-9, [[the Keeper]] must choose one of: 

- This really is a monster, but the named bystander     was secretly their ally all along 

- You are correct, but while you talked, they found     a way to attempt an escape 

- The explanation for all the events is correct but     you picked the wrong person: when you unmask     them, the villain is someone unexpected. On a miss, the monster gets an opportunity to create chaos while you explain your (incorrect) deductions.
 - **Power Snack!** : When you take the time to eat your chosen snacks and really enjoy them, take +1 [[forward]]. My power snack is: ____________________________
 - **Best Bud!** : You have an animal ally to help you solve mysteries. They can talk, but with a [[heavy]] accent (most people don’t understand).
 - **Hard Head!** : Any time you suffer [[harm]] from an attack, you may choose to take 0-[[harm]]. You instead are knocked out for a few minutes.
 - **It’s A Trap!**: When you make a trap to capture a monster or minion, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 7-9 or higher you capture something! On a 10+ not only do you capture something, but you can choose one extra effect: 

- It will take some time for the victim to get free 

- The trap inflicts [[harm]] (and may include effects     from **Wallop!** if you have that move) 

- The trap may be re-set and re-used later (you’ll     need to roll the move again when you do so,     with +1 [[forward]]). 


 - **Tell Me The Truth!**: When you are questioning somebody to [[investigate a mystery]], you may add these questions to the list you may choose to ask: 

- Who has something to gain from this situation? 

- What are you plotting? 

- Are you lying to me? 

- Who knows about ________?
 - **Run Away!**: When you decide to get out of a bad sit- uation, you can get away just fine. Unfortunately you will end up somewhere just as bad, but important to the current mystery.
 - **A Pleasant and Friendly Manner**: When you politely **manipulate somebody** , your impeccable manners always count as a reason for the person to do what you say.
 - **Wallop!**: When you use an improvised weapon to attack something, you may choose one of these extra effects: 

- Momentarily stun them with a blow to the head 

- Trip or entangle them 

- Inflict +1 [[harm]] but the improvised weapon     breaks.
