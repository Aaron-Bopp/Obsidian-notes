# The Summoned

> I was called here. Don’t know why. Don’t know where from. But I got this sense: like there’s a destiny waiting for me. I think–real soon–we’re gonna find out why I was called. But I have this feeling it’s for something bad. Real bad.

## Luck

Mark [[luck]] to change a roll to 12 or avoid all [[harm]] from an injury.

 Okay [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Doomed

**Summoned special** : Whenever you spend a [[Luck]] point, another Sign of the Apocalypse will come to pass. When you have spent all your [[Luck]], the Apocalypse begins.

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark [[unstable]].

 Okay [ ][ ][ ]|[ ][ ][ ][ ] Dying
 [[Unstable]]: [ ]

## Experience

 Experience: [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Signs & Luck

 Whenever you use [[Luck]], you’ll trigger another sign of the Apocalypse. You choose what it is, but [[the Keeper]] brings the sign into the game. When all your [[Luck]] is used, the Apocalypse is imminent. It’s up to you to stop, or cause, the end of the world. Your call.

## Introductions

 When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together. Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Summoned by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

 Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- This hunter was there when you were summoned.     Ask them who the summoners were.

- This hunter sees your human side. Ask them why.

- You could probably take this hunter in a fight, but     you’re not certain. Together, decide when the last     time you threw down was, and what interrupted     your fight.

- This hunter fascinates you, romantically. Ask them if     they know about it, and if they reciprocate it.

- This hunter is tied into your destiny somehow. Tell     them how they fit into your first sign of the Apoc-     alypse.

- This hunter saved your ass when the shit went down.     Ask them how.

- You met this hunter while separately hunting a     monster. Ask them why you now work together.

- This hunter is your good friend. Tell them if it’s from     way back, or recently.

- You are suspicious about this hunter’s motives. Ask     them what they did that gave you doubts about them.

## Leveling Up

 When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the list below.

## Improvements

 - Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2

 - Take a move from another playbook
 - Take a move from another playbook

 After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these, from the list below.
