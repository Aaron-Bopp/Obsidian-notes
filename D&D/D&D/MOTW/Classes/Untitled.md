_Your birth was prophesied. You are the Chosen_

_One, and with your abilities you can save the world. If you fail, all will be destroyed. It all rests on you. Only you._

 COoL - _Act Under Pressure_

- _Help Out_

 SHARP - _Investigate a Mystery_

- _Read a Bad Situation_

 TOUGH - _Kick Some Ass_

- _Protect Someone_

WEIRD - _Use Magic_ **Luck**

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 _or_ avoid all harm from an injury.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

**Chosen special**: When you spend a point of Luck, the Keeper will bring your fate into play.

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: b

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a

move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Fate

You get to decide what sort of fate is in store for you. Pick how you found out about your fate on the reverse side of this sheet.

## Moves

_You get all of the basic moves, plus three Chosen moves._

_You get these two:_

- **Destiny’s Plaything**: At the beginning of each mystery, roll +Weird to **see what is revealed about your immediate future**. On a 10+, the Keeper will reveal a useful detail about the coming mystery. On a 7-9 you get a vague hint about it. On a miss, something bad is going to happen to you.

- **I’m Here For A Reason**: There’s something you are destined to do. Work out the details with the Keeper, based on your fate. You cannot die until it comes to pass. **If you die in play**, then you must spend a Luck point. You will then, somehow, recover or be returned to life. Once your task is done (or you use up all your Luck), all bets are off.

_Then pick one of these:_

- **The Big Entrance**: When **you make a showy entrance into a dangerous situation**, roll +Cool. On 10+ everyone stops to watch and listen until you finish your opening speech. On a 7-9, you pick one person or monster to stop, watch and listen until you finish talking. On a miss, you’re marked as the biggest threat by all enemies who are present.

- **Devastating**: When **you inflict harm**, you may inflict +1 harm.

- **Dutiful**: When your fate rears its ugly head, and **you act in accordance with any of your fate tags** (either heroic or doom) then mark experience. If it’s a heroic tag, take +1 forward.

- **Invincible**: You always count as having 2-armour. This doesn’t stack with other protection.

- **Resilience**: You heal faster than normal people. Any time your harm gets healed, heal an extra point. Additionally, your wounds count as 1-harm less for the purpose of the Keeper’s harm moves.

## Gear

You can have protective gear worth 1-armour, if you want. You have a special weapon you are destined to wield.

## Your Special Weapon

Design your weapon by choosing a form and three business-end options (which are added to the base tags), and a material. For example, if you want a magic sword you could choose the following: handle + blade + long + magic.

**Form** (choose 1):

- staff (1-harm hand/close) - haft (2-harm hand heavy) - handle (1-harm hand balanced) - chain (1-harm hand area)

**Business-end** (choose 3 options): - artifact (add the “magic” tag) - spikes (+1 harm, add the “messy” tag) - blade (+1 harm) - heavy (+1 harm) - long (add the “close” tag) - throwable (add the “close” tag) - chain (add the “area” tag)

**Material** (choose 1):

Finally, pick what material the business-end is made from: add “steel,” “cold iron,” “silver,” “wood,” “stone,” “bone,” “teeth,” “obsidian,” or anything else you want.

## Getting Started

To make your Chosen, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, fate, moves, gear, and your special weapon. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

**Look, pick one from each List:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, androgynous.

- Fresh face, haggard face, young face, haunted face, hopeful face, controlled face.

- Preppy clothes, casual wear, urban wear, normal clothes, neat clothes, street wear.

  

**Ratings, pick one line:**

- Charm+2, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough+2, Weird-1 - Charm-1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough+2, Weird-1 - Charm+1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird-1 - Charm-1, Cool+1, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird+2 - Charm+1, Cool+2, Sharp-1, Tough-1, Weird+2

## Your Fate

**How You Found Out** (pick one): - Nightmares and visions - Some weirdo told you - An ancient cult found you - Sought out by your nemesis - Attacked by monsters - Trained from birth - You found the prophecy

Then pick two heroic and two doom tags for your fate from the lists below. This is how your fate will unfold. It’s okay to pick contradictory tags: that means your fate is pulling you both ways.

**Whenever you mark off a point of Luck,** the Keeper will throw something from your fate at you.

**Heroic** (pick two):

- Sacrifice - You are the

Champion - Visions - Secret training - Magical powers - Mystical inheritance **Doom** (pick two):

- A normal life - True love - You can save the world

- Hidden allies - The end of monsters - Divine help

- Death

- You can’t save everyone

- Impossible love - Failure - A nemesis - No normal life - Loss of loved ones

- Treachery - Doubt

- Sympathy with the enemy

- Damnation - Hosts of monsters - The end of days - The source of Evil

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**Improvements**

- Get +1 Charm, - Get +1 Weird, max +3 max +3

- Get +1 Cool, max +3 - Take another - Get +1 Sharp, Chosen move max +3 - Take another - Get +1 Tough, Chosen move max +3 - Gain an ally

- Take a move from another playbook - Take a move from another playbook

**Advanced Improvements** - Get +1 to any rating, max +3. - Change this hunter to a new type. - Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.

- Mark two of the basic moves as advanced. - Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced. - Retire this hunter to safety. - Delete one of your Doom tags, and (optionally) one of your Heroic tags. You have changed that aspect of your destiny.

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your

Chosen by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- You are close blood relations. Ask them exactly how close.

- They are destined to be your mentor. Tell them how this was revealed.

- Your best friend in the world, who you trust totally.

- A rival at first, but you came to a working arrangement.

- Romantic entanglement, or fated to be romantically entangled.

- Just friends, from school or work or something. Ask them what.

- They could have been the Chosen One instead of you, but they failed some trial. Tell them how they failed.

- You saved their life, back when they didn’t know monsters were real. Tell them what you saved them from.

## Leveling Up

After you have leveled up _five_ times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re below.

  

# The Crooked

_“Yeah, I’ve been around the block. A bit of this, a bit of that. When I came across the secret underworld of monsters and magic… well… it wasn’t so different from the underworld I already knew._

_It was easy to find an angle, just like before.”_

 COoL - _Act Under Pressure_

- _Help Out_

 SHARP - _Investigate a Mystery_

- _Read a Bad Situation_

 TOUGH - _Kick Some Ass_

- _Protect Someone_

WEIRD - _Use Magic_ **Luck**

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 _or_ avoid all harm from an injury.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

**Crooked special**: Whenever you spend a Luck point, someone from your past will re-appear in your life. Soon.

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: b

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Background

You worked a less-than-legal jo- before you became a monster hunter. What did you do?

- **Hoodlum**. You can use Tough instead of Charm to **manipulate someone** with threats of violence.

- **Burglar**. When you **break into a secure location**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ pick three, on a 7-9 pick two: you get in undetected, you get out undetected, you don’t leave a mess, you find what you were after.

- **Grifter**. When you are about to **manipulate someone**, you can ask the Keeper “What will convince this person to do what I want?” The Keeper must answer honestly, but not necessarily completely.

- **Fixer**. If you **need to buy something, sell something, or hire someone**, roll +Charm. On a 10+ you know just the person who will be interested. On a 7-9 you know the only person who can do it, but there’s a complication. Pick one: you owe them; they screwed you over; you screwed them over. On a miss, the only person who can help is someone who absolutely hates you.

- **Assassin**. When you take your first shot at an unsuspecting target, do +2 Harm. - **Charlatan**. When you want people to think you are using magic, roll +Cool. On a 10 or more, your audience is amazed and fooled by your illusion. On a 7-9 you tripped up a couple of times, maybe someone will notice. You may also **manipulate** **people** with fortune telling. When you do that, ask “What are they hoping for right now?” as a free question (even on a miss).

- **Pickpocket.** When you **steal something small**, roll +Charm. On a 10 or more, you get it and they didn’t notice you taking it. On a 7-9 either you don’t gra- it, you gra- the wrong thing, or they remember you later: your choice.

## Moves

You get all the basic moves, and two Crooked moves:

- **Artifact**: You ‘found’ a magical artifact with handy powers, and kept it. Pick one: Protective amulet (1-armour magic recharge), Lucky charm (may be used as a Luck point, once only), Grimoire (studying the book gives +1 forward to use magic), Skeleton key (opens any magically sealed lock), Imp stone (A weak demon is bound to serve the holder. The imp must be summoned with the **use magic** move).

- **Crew**: You have a regular crew, a team of three or four people who will help you out with pretty much anything. They count as a team (see page 119).

- **Deal with the Devil**: You sold your soul to the Devil. Pick one or two things you got out of the deal: wealth, fame, youth, sensual gratification, skill (add +1 to two ratings). Payment is due either when you die, in six months (if you picked two things) or otherwise in a year.

- **Friends on the Force**: You know a few cops who can be persuaded to look the other way, or do you a favour, for certain considerations. You can **act under pressure** to get in touch with them when you need to divert any law enforcement attention. There will be a cost, although maybe not right now.

- **Made**: You’re “made” in a gang. Name the gang and describe how their operations tie into your background. You can call on gang members to help you out, but they’ll expect to be paid. Your bosses will have requests for you now and again, but you’ll be paid. Minor trouble will be overlooked, but you better not screw over any other made gangsters.

- **Driver**: You have +1 ongoing while driving, plus you can hotwire anything (the older it is, the fewer tools you need to do it). You also own two handy, widely-available vehicles (perhaps a sportscar and a van).

- **Home Ground**: Your crew made a point of keeping the locals happy - keeping them safe, ensuring things always went down okay. When you’re back in your old neighbourhood, you can always find people who will hide you or help you with a minor favour, no questions asked.

- **Notorious**: You have a reputation from your criminal past. When **you reveal who you are**, your terrifying reputation counts as a reason for people to do what you ask, for the **manipulate someone** move. Revealing your identity to someone can create other problems later, of course.

  

## Gear

Effective weapons, pick three:

- .22 revolver (1-harm close reload small) - .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud) - 9mm (2-harm close loud) - Shotgun (3-harm close messy) - Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud) - Big knife (1-harm hand) - Baseball bat (1-harm hand) - Submachinegun (2-harm close reload auto) - Assault rifle (3-harm close/far auto)

## Heat

You didn’t get here without making enemies. Pick at least two of these and name the people involved: - A police detective, , has made it a personal goal to put you away.

- You have a rival from your background,

  , who never misses a chance to screw you over.

- You pissed off a well-connected criminal,

 , and they’ll do whatever they can to destroy you.

-  is someone with special powers, a person or monster, who you took advantage of.

-  is an old partner you betrayed in the

middle of a job. **Underworld**

Pick how you discovered about the real underworld. Keep this in mind when you select your moves in the next section, so that everything fits together. - The target of a jo- was a dangerous creature. Pick one: vampire, werewolf, troll, reptiloid. - You worked with someone who was more than they seemed. Pick one: sorcerer, demon, faerie, psychic.

- You were hired by something weird. Pick one: [[immortal]], god, outsider, witch.

- Things went south on a job—including, but not limited to, running into (choose one): a horde of goblins, a hunger of ghouls, a dream-eater, a salamander.

## Getting Started

To make your Crooked, pick a name. Then follow the instructions in this playbook to decide your look, ratings, background, heat, underworld, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

**Look, pick one from each List:**

- Man, woman, concealed.

- Hard eyes, friendly eyes, watchful eyes, smiling eyes, calculating eyes.

- Street wear, tailored suit, cheap suit, tracksuit, nondescript clothes.

**Ratings, pick one line:**

- Charm +1, Cool +1, Sharp +2, Tough 0, Weird -1 - Charm -1, Cool +1, Sharp +1, Tough +2, Weird 0 - Charm -1, Cool +2, Sharp +2, Tough 0, Weird -1 - Charm +2, Cool +1, Sharp +1, Tough 0, Weird -1

- Charm +2, Cool 0, Sharp +1, Tough -1, Weird +1

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your

Crooked by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- This hunter knows about your criminal past. Tell them what crimes they saw you commit.

- This hunter was there when you decided to give up the life and hunt monsters instead. Work out together what happened.

- This hunter is your younger sibling or child (possibly adopted). You look out for them.

- This hunter is a cousin or more distant relative.

- This hunter saved your life when a monster had the drop on you. Now you owe them one.

- This hunter worked with you on a semi-legal or illegal job. Work out what it was.

- This hunter is your moral compass. When you talk over things with them, their advice keeps you on the straight and narrow.

- You’re powerfully attracted to this hunter. Maybe someday you’ll deserve them.

list below.

## Improvements

- Get +1 Sharp, max +3 - Get +1 Tough, max +2 - Get +1 Cool, max +2 - Get +1 Charm, max +2 - Take another Crooked move - Take another Crooked move - Gain an ally: one of your old crew.

- Recover a stash of money from the old days, enough

to live without care... for a year or two. - Take a move from another playbook - Take a move from another playbook

## Harm

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: b

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

You get all the basic moves, and pick three Divine moves:

- **Boss from Beyond**: **At the beginning of each mystery**, roll +Weird. On a 10+, your Superiors ask you to do something simple. On a 7-9, they ask you to do something complicated or difficult. In either case, you get to ask them one of the questions from the **investigate a mystery** move right now. On a

miss, you are required to do something terrible. If you do not accomplish what they’ve ordered, you cannot use this move again until you have made up for your failure.

- **Angel Wings**: You can go instantly to anywhere you’ve visited before, or to a person you know well. When **you carry one or two people with you**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. On a 7-9, you don’t quite manage it. Either you are all separated, or you all appear in the wrong place.

- **What I Need, When I Need It**: You may store any small object you own, putting it into a magical space nobody can get to. You may retrieve anything you stored at any time; it appears in your hand.

- **Smite**: Your body and divine weapon always count as a weakness against the monsters you fight. Your unarmed attacks are 2-harm intimate hand messy.

## Gear

_Pick one divine weapon:_

- Flaming sword (3-harm hand fire holy) - Thunder hammer (3-harm hand stun holy) - Razor whip (3-harm hand area messy holy) - Five demon bag (3-harm close magic holy) - Silver trident (3-harm hand silver holy) You also get divine armour (1-armour holy). It has a look suited to your divine origin.

- **Soothe**: **When** **you talk to someone for a few seconds in a quiet voice**, you can calm them down, blocking any panic, anger, or other negative emotions they have. This works even if the thing that freaked them out is still present, as long as your voice can be heard.

- **Lay On Hands**: Your touch can heal injury and disease. When you **lay your hands on someone hurt**, roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2 harm or an illness, plus they’re stabilized. On a 7-9, you can heal the harm or illness as on a 10+, but you take it into yourself. On a miss, your aura causes them extra harm. - **Cast Out Evil**: You may **banish an unnatural creature from your presence**. Roll +Tough. On a 10+ it is banished. On a 7-9 it takes a little while for the banishing to take effect—the creature has time to make one or two actions. Either way, the banished creature is unharmed, and you have no control over where it goes. This move may be used on unnatural hunters (e.g. [[the Monstrous]]). On a miss, something is keeping it here. That’s bad.

## Mission

You have been put on Earth for a purpose. Pick one: - You are here to fight the schemes of an Adversary.

- The End of Days approaches. Your role is to guide these hunters and prevent it from coming to pass.

- The End of Days approaches. Your role is to guide these hunters and ensure it comes to pass.

- You have been exiled. You must work for the cause of Good without drawing attention from your brothers and sisters, as they are bound to execute you for your crimes. - One of the other hunters has a crucial role to play in events to come. You must prepare them for their role, and protect them at _any_ cost.

- If you are protecting another hunter as your mission, tell them this: You have a crucial role in what is to come. I am here to guide and defend you.

- They should not be involved in this situation: the prophecies didn’t mention them at all. This gets your attention but you don’t know what it means yet.

- They are, at heart, a good and righteous person. You must help them stay that way.

- They are an abomination, and should be destroyed. Except you can’t–work out with them why not.

- Their prayer (perhaps an informal or even unconscious prayer) summoned you.

- They fill you with feelings of sexual infatuation. You are confused by the associated mortal emotions.

- They saved your life, and you understand (intellectually at least) that you owe them for it.

- They’re the person you go to for advice on mortal stuff (e.g sex, food, drugs, television, etc).

list below.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

_You get all of the basic moves, plus pick two Expert moves:_

- **I’ve Read About This Sort Of Thing**: Roll +Sharp instead of +Cool when you **act under pressure**. - **Often Right**: When **a hunter comes to you for advice** about a problem, give them your honest opinion and advice. If they take your advice, they get +1 ongoing while following your advice, and you mark experience.

- **Preparedness:** When **you need something unusual or rare**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you have it here right now. On a 7-9 you have it, but not here: it will take some time to get it. On a miss, you know where it is, but it’s somewhere real bad.

- **It Wasn’t As Bad As It Looked**: Once per mystery, you may attempt to **keep going despite your injuries**. Roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2 harm and stabilize your wounds. On a 7-9 you may either stabilize or heal 1 harm. On a miss, it was worse than it looked: the Keeper may inflict a harm move on you, or make your wounds unstable. - **Precise Strike**. When you inflict harm on a monster, you can **aim for a weak spot**. Roll +Tough. On a 10+ you inflict +2 harm. On a 7-9 you inflict +1 harm. On a miss, you leave yourself open to the monster.

- **The Woman (or Man) With The Plan**: **At the beginning of each mystery**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ hold 2, on a 7-9 hold 1. Spend the hold to be where you need to be, prepared and ready. On a miss, the Keeper holds 1 they can spend to put you in the worst place, unprepared and unready.

- **Dark Past**: If **you trawl through your memories** for something relevant to the case at hand, roll +Weird. On a 10+ ask the Keeper two questions from the list below. On a 7-9 ask one. On a miss, you can ask a question anyway but that will mean you were personally complicit in creating the situation you are now dealing with. The questions are:

- _When I dealt with this creature (or one of its kind), what did I learn?_

- _What black magic do I know that could help here?_

- _Do I know anyone who might be behind this?_

- _Who do I know who can help us right now?_

## Haven

You have set up a haven, a safe place to work. Pick three of the options below for your haven:

- **Lore Library**. When you hit the books, take +1 forward to **investigate the mystery** (as long as historical or reference works are appropriate).

- **Mystical Library**. If you use your library’s occult tomes and grimoires, preparing with your tomes and grimoires, take +1 forward for **use magic**.

- **Protection Spells**. Your haven is safe from monsters—they cannot enter. Monsters might be able to do something special to evade the wards, but not easily.

- **Armory**. You have a stockpile of mystical and rare monster-killing weapons and items. If you **need a special weapon**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you have it (and plenty if that matters). On a 7-9 you have it, but only the minimum. On a miss, you’ve got the wrong thing.

- **Infirmary**. You can heal people, and have the space for one or two to recuperate. The Keeper will tell you how long any patient’s recovery is likely to take, and if you need extra supplies or help.

- **Workshop**. You have a space for building and repairing guns, cars and other gadgets. Work out with the Keeper how long any repair or construction will take, and if you need extra supplies or help.

- **Oubliette**. This room is isolated from every kind of monster, spirit and magic that you know about. Anything you stash in there can’t be found, can’t do any magic, and can’t get out.

- **Panic Room**. This has essential supplies and is protected by normal and mystical means. You can hide out there for a few days, safe from pretty much anything.

- **Magical Laboratory**. You have a mystical la- with all kinds of weird ingredients and tools useful for casting spells (like the **use magic** move, big magic, and any other magical moves).

## Gear

You get three monster-slaying weapons.

**Monster-slaying weapons** (pick three):

- Mallet & wooden stakes (3-harm intimate slow

wooden)

- Silver sword (2-harm hand messy silver) - Cold iron sword (2-harm hand messy iron) - Blessed knife (2-harm hand holy) - Magical dagger (2-harm hand magic) - Juju bag (1-harm far magic) - Flamethrower (3-harm close fire heavy volatile) - Magnum (3-harm close reload loud) - Shotgun (3-harm close messy loud)

# The Flake

_Everything’s connected. But not everyone can see the patterns, and most people don’t even look that hard. But me, I can never stop looking deeper. I can never stop seeing the truth. I spot the patterns. That’s how I found the monsters, and that’s how I help kill them._

## Harm

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

## Experience

_You get all of the basic moves, plus pick three Flake moves:_

- **Connect the Dots**: At the beginning of each mystery, if **you look for the wider patterns** that current events might be part of, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. Spend your hold during the mystery to ask the Keeper any one of the following questions:

- _Is this person connected to current events more than they are saying?_

- _When and where will the next critical event occur?_

- _What does the monster want from this person?_

- _Is this connected to previous mysteries we have investigated?_

- _How does this mystery connect to the bigger picture?_

- **Crazy Eyes**: You get +1 Weird (max +3).

- **See, It All Fits Together**: You can use Sharp instead of Charm when you **manipulate someone**.

- **Suspicious Mind**: If someone lies to you, you know it.

- **Often Overlooked**: When **you** **act all crazy** to avoid something, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you’re regarded as unthreatening and unimportant. On a 7-9, pick one: unthreatening or unimportant. On a miss, you draw lots (but not all) of the attention.

- **Contrary**: When **you seek out and receive someone’s honest advice** on the best course of action for you and then do something else instead, mark experience. If you do exactly the opposite of their advice, you also take +1 ongoing on any moves you make pursuing that course. - **Net Friends**: You know a lot of people on the Internet. When **you** **contact a net friend to help you** with a mystery, roll +Charm. On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information. On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. On a miss, you burn some bridges. - **Sneaky**: When **you attack from ambush, or from behind**, inflict +2 harm.

Flake by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

- They’re somehow tied into it all. You’ve been keeping an eye on them.

- They’re a close relative. Ask them to decide exactly what.

- Old friends, who originally met through a long chain of coincidences.

- You went through hell together: maybe a monster, maybe military service, maybe time in an institution. Whatever it was, it bound you together, and you have total trust in each other.

- Members of the same support group.

- Fellow freaks.

- The signs all pointed to working together. So you found them and now you work together.

- You know each other through cryptozoology and conspiracy theory websites.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

## Experience

_You get all of the basic moves, plus four Initiate moves. You get this one:_

- When you **are in good standing with your Sect**, **at the beginning of each mystery**, roll +Charm. On a 10+ they provide some useful info or help in the field. On a 7-9 you get a mission associated with the mystery, and if you do it you’ll get some info or help too. On a miss, they ask you to do something bad. If you fail a mission or refuse an order, you’ll be in trouble with the Sect until you atone. _Then pick three of these:_

- **Ancient Fighting Arts**: When using an old-fashioned hand weapon, you inflict +1 harm and get +1 whenever you roll **protect someone**.

- **Mystic**: Every time you successfully **use magic**, take +1 forward. - **Fortunes**: The Sect has ancient prophecies or divination techniques to predict the future. Once per mystery, you may use them. If **you look at what the future holds**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, you get bad information and the Keeper decides how that affects you. Spend your hold to:

- have a useful object ready.

- be somewhere you are needed, just in time.

- take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to another hunter.

- retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesn’t happen. - **Sacred Oath:** You may bind yourself to a single goal, forsaking something during your quest (e.g. speech, all sustenance but bread and water, alcohol, lying, sex, etc). Get the Keeper’s agreement on this—it should match the goal in importance and difficulty. While you keep your oath and work towards your goal, mark experience at the end of every session and get +1 on any rolls that directly help achieve the goal. If you break the oath, take -1 ongoing until you have atoned.

- **Mentor**: You have a mentor in the Sect: name them. When you **contact your mentor for info**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you get an answer to your question, no problem. On a 7-9 you choose: they’re either busy and can’t help, or they answer the question but you owe a favour. On a miss, your question causes trouble. - **Apprentice**: You have an apprentice: name them. Your jo- is to teach them the Sect’s ways. They count as an **ally**: **subordinate** (motivation: to follow your instructions to the letter).

- **Helping Hand**: When you successfully **help out** another hunter, they get +2 instead of the usual +1.

- **That Old Black Magic**: When you **use magic**, you can ask a question from the **investigate a mystery** move as your effect.

## Gear

If your Sect has **fighting arts** or **obsolete gear** (see next page) then pick three old-fashioned weapons. If the Sect has **modernised** or **nifty gadgets**, you may pick two modern weapons. Otherwise, pick two old-fashioned weapons and one modern weapon.

# The Monstrous

_I feel the hunger, the lust to destroy. But I fight it: I never give in. I’m not human any more, not really, but I have to protect those who still are. That way I can tell myself I’m different to the other monsters. Sometimes I can even believe it._

**Experience**

## Monster Breed

You’re half-human, half-monster: decide if you were always this way or if you you were originally human and transformed somehow.

Now decide if you were always fighting to be good, or if you were evil and changed sides.

Define your monstrous breed by picking a curse, moves, and natural attacks.

Create the monster you want to be: whatever you choose defines your breed in the game. Some classic monsters with suggestions for picks are listed on the back of this sheet. These are _only_ suggestions: feel free to make a different version!

**Curses, pick one:**

- **Feed:** You must subsist on living humans—it might take the form of blood, brains, or spiritual essence but it must be from people. You need to **act under pressure** to resist feeding whenever a perfect opportunity presents itself.

- **Vulnerability**: Pick a substance. You suffer +1 harm when you suffer harm from it. If you are bound or surrounded by it, you must **act under pressure** to use your powers. - **Pure Drive**: One emotion rules you. Pick from: hunger, hate, anger, fear, jealousy, greed, joy, pride, envy, lust, or cruelty. Whenever you have a chance to indulge that emotion, you must do so immediately, or **act under pressure** to resist.

- **Dark Master**: You have an evil lord who doesn’t know you changed sides. They still give you orders, and they do not tolerate refusal. Or failure.

## Natural Attacks

_Pick a Base and add an extra to it, or two Bases._

- Base: teeth (3-harm intimate) - Base: claws (2-harm hand) - Base: magical force (1-harm magical close) - Base: life-drain (1-harm intimate life-drain) - Extra: Add +1 harm to a base - Extra: Add ignore-armour to a base - Extra: Add an extra range to a base (add intimate, hand, or close).

- **Unholy Strength**: Roll +Weird instead of +Tough when you **kick some ass**.

- **Incorporeal**: You may move freely through solid objects (but not people).

- **Preternatural Speed**: You go much faster than normal people. **When you chase, flee, or run** take

+1 ongoing.

- **Claws of the Beast**: All your natural attacks get +1 harm. - **Mental Dominion**: When you gaze into a normal human’s eyes and **exert your will over them**, roll +Charm. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold to give them an order. Regular people will follow your order, whatever it is. Hunters can choose whether they do it or not. If they do, they mark experience.

- **Unquenchable Vitality**: When you have taken harm, **you can heal yourself**. Roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a 7-9, heal 1-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a miss, your injuries worsen.

- **Dark Negotiator**: You can use the **manipulate someone** move on monsters as well as people, if they can reason and talk. - **Flight**: You can fly. - **Shapeshifter**: You may change your form (usually into an animal). Decide if you have just one alternate form or several, and detail them. You gain +1 to **investigate a mystery** when using an alternate form’s superior senses (e.g. smell for a wolf, sight for an eagle).

- **Always The Victim**: When another hunter uses **protect someone** to protect you, they mark experience. Whenever a monster captures you, you mark experience.

- **Oops!** If **you want to stumble across something important**, tell the Keeper. You will find something important and useful, although not necessarily related to your immediate problems.

- **Let’s Get Out Of Here!** If you can **protect someone** by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll +Charm instead of +Tough.

- **Panic Button**: When you need to escape, **name the route you’ll try** and roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you’re out of danger, no problem. On a 7-9 you can go or stay, but if you go it’s going to cost you (you leave something behind or something comes with you). On a miss, you are caught halfway out.

- **The Power of Heart**: When fighting a monster, if you **help someone**, don’t roll +Cool. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.

- **Trust Me**: When **you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger**, roll +Charm. On a 10+ they’ll do what you say they should, no questions asked. On a 7-9 they do it, but the Keeper chooses one from:

- They ask you a hard question first.

- They stall and dither a while.

- They have a “better” idea. On a miss, they’re going to think you’re crazy and maybe dangerous too.

- **What Could Go Wrong?**: Whenever you **charge into immediate danger** without hedging your bets, hold 2. You may spend your hold to:

- Inflict +1 harm.

- Reduce someone’s harm suffered by 1.

- Take +2 forward on an **act under pressure** roll.

- You’re a bit suspicious of them (maybe due to their unnatural powers or something like that).

- They introduced you to the existence of monsters. Tell them how you feel about that.

- You saved their life from a monster due to an unlikely chain of events. Tell them what.

# The ProfesSional

_It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 jo- is to hunt down monsters. Still, that’s the jo- I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”_

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 _or_ avoid all harm from an injury.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

**Experience**

## Moves

_You get all the basic moves, plus four Professional moves._

_Pick three of these:_

- **Bottle It Up**: If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you **act under pressure**. For each +1 you use, the Keeper holds 1. That hold can be spent later—one for one—to give you -1 on any move _except_ **act under pressure**. - **Unfazeable**: Take +1 Cool (max +3).

- **Battlefield Awareness**: You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever you get from your gear.

- **Leave No One Behind**: In combat, when **you help someone escape**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can _either_ get them out _or_ suffer no harm, you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention.

- **Tactical Genius**: When you **read a bad situation**, you may roll +Cool instead of +Sharp

- **Medic**: You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. **When you do first aid**, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 harm. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 harm or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 harm. This move takes the place of regular first aid.

- **Mobility**: You have a truck, van, or car built for monster hunting. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it.

_Good things_: roomy; surveillance gear; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed weapons; anonymous; armoured (+1 armour inside); tough; monster cage.

_Bad things_: loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-guzzler; uncomfortable; slow; old.

_And you get this one:_

- When you **deal with the Agency,** requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.

## Gear

Pick one serious weapon and two normal weapons.

You get _either_ a flak vest (1-armour hidden) _or_ combat armour (2-armour heavy) for protection.

Serious weapons (pick one):

- Assault rifle (3-harm far area loud reload)

- Grenade launcher (4-harm far area messy loud

reload)

- Sniper rifle (4-harm far) - Grenades (4-harm close area messy loud) - Submachine gun (3-harm close area loud reload)

Normal weapons (pick two): - .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud) - 9mm (2-harm close loud) - Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud) - Shotgun (3-harm close messy) - Big knife (1-harm hand)

- You are related. Tell them how close.

- You met on a mission and worked together unofficially. And successfully.

- They pulled you (and maybe your team) out of a terrible FUBARed mission.

- You got sent to “deal with them” as a hazard to the Agency’s policies one time. Tell them how you resolved this.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Combat Magic

You have a few attack spells you can use as weapons. When you use these spells to **kick some ass**, roll +Weird instead of +Tough. Sometimes the situation may require you to **act under pressure** to cast your spell without problems.

Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells with any of your effects.

**Combat magic, pick three (with at least one base): Bases:**

- **Blast**: 2-harm magic close obvious loud - **Ball**: 1-harm magic area close obvious loud - **Missile**: 1-harm magic far obvious loud - **Wall**: 1-harm magic barrier close 1-armour obvious loud **Effects:**

- **Fire**: Add “+2 harm fire” to a base. If you get a 10+ on a combat magic roll, the fire won’t spread.

- **Force or Wind**: Add “+1 harm forceful” to a base, or “+1 armour” to a wall.

- **Lightning or Entropy**: Add “+1 harm messy” to a base. - **Frost or Ice**: Adds “-1 harm +2 armour” to a wall, or “+1 harm restraining” to other bases. - **Earth**: Add “forceful restraining” to a base. - **Necromantic**: Add “life-drain” to a base.

## Moves

You get all the basic moves and four Spell-slinger moves. You have this one:

- **Tools and Techniques:** To use your combat magic effectively, you rely on a collection of tools and techniques. Cross off one; you’ll need the rest.

- **Consumables**: You need certain supplies— powders, oils, etc—on hand, some will be used up each cast. If you don’t have them, take 1-harm ignore-armour when you cast.

- **Foci**: You need wands, staves, and other obvious props to focus. If you don’t have what you need, your combat magic does 1 less harm.

- **Gestures**: You need to wave your hands around to use combat magic. If you’re restrained, take -1 ongoing for combat magic.

- **Incantations**: You must speak in an arcane language to control your magic. If you use combat magic without speaking, **act under pressure** to avoid scrambling your thoughts.

Plus pick three of these:

- **Advanced Arcane Training**: If you have two of your three Tools and Techniques at the ready, you may ignore the third one.

- **Arcane Reputation**: Pick three big organizations or groups in the supernatural community, which can include some of the more sociable types of monsters. They’ve heard of you and respect your power. With affected humans, take +1 forward when you **manipulate** them. You may **manipulate** affected monsters as if they were human, with no bonus.

- **Could’ve Been Worse**: When you miss a **use magic** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic:

- **Fizzle**: The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You’ll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.

- **This Is Gonna Suck**: The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.

- **Enchanted Clothing**: Pick an article of every-day clothing–it’s enchanted without any change in appearance. Take -1 harm from any source that tries to get at you through the garment.

- **Forensic Divination**: When you successfully **investigate a mystery**, you may ask “What magic was done here?” as a free extra question.

- **Go Big or Go Home**: When you must **use magic** as a requirement for Big Magic, take +1 ongoing to those **use magic** rolls.

- **Not My Fault**: +1 to **act under pressure** when you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting.

- **Practitioner**: Choose two effects available to you under **use magic**. Take +1 to **use magic** whenever you choose one of those effects.

- **Shield Spell**: When you **protect someone**, gain 2-armour against any harm that is transferred to you. This doesn’t stack with your other armour, if any.

- **Third Eye**: When you **read a bad situation**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 hold on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you’re exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!

## Gear

You don’t need much—aside from any foci or consumables to power your magic. Still, it’s good to carry some backup. Pick one:

- Old revolver (2-harm close reload loud) - Ritual knife (1-harm hand) - Heirloom sword (2-harm hand messy)

# The SpOoky

_I can do things, things that normal people can’t._

_But there’s a price—I haven’t paid it in full, yet, but the bill’s gonna come due soon. It’s best I don’t tell you any more. You get too close, you’ll get hurt._

 SHARP - _Investigate a Mystery_

 TOUGH - _Kick Some Ass_

- _Protect Someone_

WEIRD - _Use Magic_ **Luck**

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 _or_ avoid all harm from an injury.

Okay bbbbbb- Doomed

**Spooky special:** As you mark off Luck boxes, your dark side’s needs will get nastier.

## Harm

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Okay bbb|bbb- Dying

Unstable: - 

_(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)_

## Experience

_Experience_: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Moves

_You get all the basic moves, plus pick three Spooky moves:_

- **Telepathy:** You can read people’s thoughts and put words in their mind. This can allow you to **investigate a mystery** or **read a bad situation** without needing to actually talk. You can also **manipulate someone** without speaking. You still roll moves as normal, except people will not expect the weirdness of your mental communication. - **Hex:** When you cast a spell (with **use magic**), as well as the normal effects, you may pick from the following:

- The target contracts a disease.

- The target immediately suffers harm (2-harm magic ignore-armour).

- The target breaks something precious or important.

- **The Sight:** You can see the invisible, especially spirits and magical influences. You may communicate with (maybe even make deals with) the spirits you see, and they give you more opportunities to spot clues when you **investigate a mystery**.

- **Premonitions:** **At the start of each mystery**, roll +Weird. On a 10+, you get a detailed vision of something bad that is yet to happen. You take +1 forward to prevent it coming true, and mark experience if you stop it. On a 7-9+ you get clouded images of something bad that is yet to happen: mark experience if you stop it. On a miss, you get a vision of something bad happening to you and the Keeper holds 3, to be spent one-for-one as penalties to rolls you make.

- **Hunches:** **When something bad is happening** (or just about to happen) somewhere that you aren’t, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you knew where you needed to go, just in time to get there. On a 7-9, you get there late—in time to intervene, but not prevent it altogether. On a miss, you get there just in time to be in trouble yourself.

- **Tune In**: You can **attune your mind to a monster or minion**. Roll +Weird. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. On a miss, the monster becomes aware of you. Spend one hold to ask the Keeper one of the following questions, and gain +1 ongoing while acting on the answers:

- _Where is the creature right now?_

- _What is it planning to do right now?_

- _Who is it going to attack next?_

- _Who does it regard as the biggest threat?_

- _How can I attract its attention?_

- **The Big Whammy**: You can use your powers to **kick some ass:** roll +Weird instead of +Tough. The attack has 2-harm close obvious ignore-armour. On a miss, you’ll get a magical backlash.

- **Jinx**: You can encourage coincidences to occur, the way you want. **When you jinx a target**, roll +Weird.

On a 10+ hold 2 and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, the Keeper holds 2 over you to be used in the same way.

Spend your hold to:

- Interfere with a hunter, giving them -1 forward.

- Help a hunter, giving them +1 forward, by interfering with their enemy.

- Interfere with what a monster, minion, or bystander is trying to do.

- Inflict 1-harm on the target due to an accident.

- The target finds something you left for them.

- The target loses something that you will soon find.

## Gear

You get two normal weapons and any magical items or amulets that you use to invoke your powers.

Normal weapons (pick two): - .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud) - 9mm (2-harm close loud) - Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud) - Shotgun (3-harm close messy) - Big knife (1-harm hand)

## Getting Started

To make your Spooky, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions in this playbook to decide your look, ratings, moves, dark side and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

**Look, pick one from each List:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, concealed, androgynous.

- Burning eyes, dark eyes, pained eyes, blank eyes, unblinking eyes, piercing eyes, shadowed eyes, creepy eyes.

## The Dark Side

Your powers have an unsavory source, and sometimes you get tempted to do things you shouldn’t. These could be orders from whatever granted your power, or urges that bubble up from your subconscious. Something like that. Whatever it is, it’s unsettling.

_Pick three tags for your dark side:_

- Violence - Depression - Secrets - Lust - Dark bargain - Guilt - Soulless - Addiction

- Mood swings - Rage

- Self-destruction - Greed for power - Poor impulse control - Hallucinations - Pain - Paranoia

The Keeper can ask you to do nasty things (in accordance with the tags), when your powers need you to. If you do whatever is asked, mark experience. If you don’t do it, then your powers are unavailable until the end of the mystery (or until you cave). As you mark off Luck boxes, these requests will get bigger and nastier.

Spooky by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each hunter:

- They taught you to control your powers, to the extent that you can control them at all.

- You are blood-kin. Decide together exactly what.

- You are married, or romantically involved. Decide between you the exact relationship.

- You’re old friends, and trust each other completely.

- You used your powers on them one time. Decide if it was for selfish reasons or not, and tell them if they found out about it.

- You’ve known each other some time, but since your powers manifested, you keep them at a distance emotionally.

- You hope they can help you control your powers.

- They saw you use your powers for selfish or vindictive reasons. Ask them who the victim was, and then tell them what you did.

- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one. - Mark two of the basic moves as advanced. - Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced.

- Retire this hunter to safety. - You discover how to use your powers at a lower price.

- **I Know My Prey**: You get +1 ongoing when knowingly investigating, pursuing or fighting the breed of monster that caused your loss.

_Then pick two of these:_

- **Berserk**: No matter how much harm you take, you can always keep going until the current fight is over. During a fight, the Keeper may not use harm moves on you and you cannot die. When the fight ends, all harm takes effect as normal.

- **NEVER AGAIN**: In combat, you may choose to **protect someone** without rolling, as if you had rolled a 10+, but you may not choose to “suffer little harm.”

- **What Does Not Kill Me...**: If you have suffered harm in a fight, you gain +1 ongoing until the fight is over. - **Fervor**: When you **manipulate someone**, roll +Tough instead of +Charm. - **Safety First:** You have jury-rigged extra protection into your gear, giving you +1 armour (maximum 2-armour).

- **DIY Surgery**: When **you do quick and dirty first aid on someone** (including yourself), roll +Cool. On a 10+ it’s all good, it counts as normal first aid, plus stabilize the injury and heal 1 harm. On a 7-9 it counts as normal first aid, plus one of these, your choice:

- Stabilise the injury but the patient takes -1 forward.

- Heal 1-harm and stabilise for now, but it will return as 2-harm and become unstable again later.

- Heal 1-harm and stabilise but the patient takes -1 ongoing until it’s fixed properly.

- **Tools Matter**: With your signature weapon (see your gear, below), you get +1 to **kick some ass**.

## Gear

Pick one signature weapon and two practical weapons. You have protective wear, suited to your look, worth 1-armour.

If you want, you may take a classic car, classic motorcycle, plain pickup, or plain van.

Signature Weapons, pick one:
