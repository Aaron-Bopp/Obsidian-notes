*I am the Light, the Sword.*

*I am sent to defend the meek from Darkness.*

*All Evil fears me, for I am its end.*

To make your Divine, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, mission, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].


**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, androgynous, asexual.
- Blazing eyes, terrifying eyes, placid eyes, sparkling eyes, perceptive eyes, starry eyes, glowing eyes.
- Dirty clothes, perfect suit, rumpled suit, casual clothes, practical clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]-1, [[Tough]]+2, [[Weird]]=0
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]+2, [[Sharp]]-1, [[Tough]]+2, [[Weird]]=0
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]+2, [[Weird]]+1
- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]+2, [[Weird]]-1
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]+2, [[Weird]]+1

## **MISSION**


You have been put on Earth for a purpose. Pick one:

- You are here to fight the schemes of an Adversary.
- The End of Days approaches. Your role is to guide these hunters and prevent it from coming to pass.
- The End of Days approaches. Your role is to guide these hunters and ensure it comes to pass.
- You have been exiled. You must work for the cause of Good without drawing attention from your brothers and sisters, as they are bound to execute you for your crimes.
- One of the other hunters has a crucial role to play in events to come. You must prepare them for their role, and protect them at *any* cost.

## **[[MOVES]]**


You get all the basic [[moves]], and pick three Divine [[moves]]:

- ![[Boss from Beyond]]
- ![[Angel Wings]]
- ![[What I Need, When I Need It]]
- ![[Soothe]]
- ![[Lay On Hands]]
- ![[Cast Out Evil]]
- ![[Smite]]
## **[[GEAR]]**


*Pick one divine weapon:*

- Flaming sword (3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[fire]] [[holy]])
- Thunder hammer (3-[[harm]] [[hand]] stun [[holy]])
- Razor whip (3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[area]] [[messy]] [[holy]])
- Five demon bag (3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[magic]] [[holy]])
- Silver trident (3-[[harm]] [[hand]] silver [[holy]])

You also get divine [[armour]] (1-[[armour]] [[holy]]). It has a look suited to your divine origin.

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Divine by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- If you are protecting another hunter as your mission, tell them this: You have a crucial role in what is to come. I am here to guide and defend you.
- They should not be involved in this situation: the prophecies didn’t mention them at all. This gets your attention but you don’t know what it means yet.
- They are, at heart, a good and righteous person. You must help them stay that way.
- They are an abomination, and should be destroyed. Except you can’t–work out with them why not.
- Their prayer (perhaps an informal or even unconscious prayer) summoned you.
- They fill you with feelings of sexual infatuation. You are [[confused]] by the associated mortal emotions.
- They saved your life, and you understand (intellectually at least) that you owe them for it.
- They’re the person you go to for advice on mortal stuff (e.g sex, food, drugs, television, etc).

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as just 0-[[harm]]. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbb b bbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark of the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]]”.

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever your roll totals 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the list below.

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]:**

- Get +1 [[Tough]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Charm]], max +2

- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +2
- Take another Divine move
- Take another Divine move
- Gain a lesser divine being as an ally, sent from above to help with your mission
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
