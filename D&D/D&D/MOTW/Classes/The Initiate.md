The Initiate

*Since the dawn of [[history]], we have been the bulwark against Darkness. We know the Evils of the world, and we stand against them so that the mass of humanity need not fear. We are the Flame that cleanses the Shadows.*

To make your Initiate, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], Sect, and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

## **[[MOVES]]**


*You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus four Initiate [[moves]]. You get this one:*

- When you **are in good standing with your Sect**, **at the beginning of each mystery**, roll +[[Charm]]. On a 10+ they provide some [[useful]] info or help in the field. On a 7-9 you get a mission associated with the mystery, and if you do it you’ll get some info or help too. On a miss, they ask you to do something bad. If you fail a mission or refuse an order, you’ll be in trouble with the Sect until you atone.

*Then pick three of these:*

- ![[Ancient Fighting Arts]]
- ![[Mystic]]
- ![[Fortunes]]
- ![[Mentor]]
- ![[Sacred Oath]]
- ![[Apprentice]]
- ![[Helping Hand]]
- ![[That Old Black Magic]]
## **SECT**


You are part of an ancient, secret order that slays [[monsters]]. Where are they from? How old are they? Are they religious? Why do they stay secret? How do they recruit?

You also need to pick the Sect’s traditions (these will be used by [[the Keeper]] to determine the Sect’s methods and actions):

**Good Traditions** (pick two):

- Knowledgable
- Ancient lore
- Magical lore
- Fighting arts
- Modernised

- Magical items

**Bad Traditions** (pick one):

- Dubious motives
- Tradition-bound

- Paranoid and secretive
- Closed hierarchy
- Factionalised
- Strict laws
- Mystical oaths
- Total obedience
- Tyrannical leaders
- Obsolete [[gear]]
- Poor

## **[[GEAR]]**


If the Sect has **fighting arts** or **obsolete [[gear]]**, then pick three old-fashioned [[weapons]]. If the Sect has **modernised** or **nifty gadgets**, you may pick two modern [[weapons]]. Otherwise, pick two old-fashioned [[weapons]] and one modern weapon.

You also get old-fashioned [[armour]] (1-[[armour]] [[heavy]]).

Old-fashioned [[weapons]] (pick either two or three, as above):

- Sword (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]])
- Axe (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]])
- Big sword (3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]] [[heavy]])

- Silver knife (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] silver)
- Fighting sticks (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[quick]])
- Spear (2-[[harm]] hand/close)

- Sniper rifle (3-[[harm]] [[far]])
- Magnum (3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[reload]] [[loud]])
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[messy]])

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Initiate by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They are a lay member of your Sect.
- You fought together when the tide of [[monsters]] seemed [[unstoppable]]. Ask them how it went.
- Friends, but they first met you under your cover identity, and [[learned]] about the Sect later. Ask how they feel about that.
- They are your [[close]] relative, or partner/spouse. Decide between you exactly what the relationship is.
- Fellow ancient weapons/martial arts club members.
- They’re described in the prophecies, but the role they will play isn’t stated.
- An ex-member of the Sect, but still friends. Ask them why they left or got thrown out
- You met researching mystical weirdness, and you’ve been occult comrades ever since.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your [[Luck]] boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Tough]], max +2
- Take another Initiate move
- Take another Initiate move
- Get command of your chapter of the Sect
- Get a Sect team under your command
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Become the leader, or effective leader, of the whole Sect.
