[[The Initiate]]

*Since the dawn of [[history]], we have been the bulwark against Darkness. We know the Evils of the world, and we stand against them so that the mass of humanity need not fear. We are the Flame that cleanses the Shadows.*

To make your Initiate, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], Sect, and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, masked, concealed.
- Hardened body, tattooed body, agile body, strong body, thin body, angular body, hunched body.
- Archaic clothes, unfashionable clothes, ceremonial clothes, mismatched clothes, formal clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm-1, Cool+1, Sharp=0, Tough+1, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm-1, Cool=0, Sharp-1, Tough+2, Weird+2
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool=0, Sharp=0, Tough+1, Weird+2

**[[MOVES]]**

*You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus four Initiate [[moves]]. You get this one:*

- When you **are in good standing with your Sect**, **at the beginning of each mystery**, roll +Charm. On a 10+ they provide some useful info or help in the field. On a 7-9 you get a mission associated with the mystery, and if you do it you’ll get some info or help too. On a miss, they ask you to do something bad. If you fail a mission or refuse an order, you’ll be in trouble with the Sect until you atone.

*Then pick three of these:*

- **Ancient Fighting Arts**: When using an old-fashioned hand weapon, you inflict +1 [[harm]] and get +1 whenever you roll **[[protect someone]]**.
- **Mystic**: Every time you successfully **[[use magic]]**, take +1 [[forward]].
- **Fortunes**: The Sect has ancient prophecies or divination techniques to predict the future. Once per mystery, you may use them. If **you look at what the future holds**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ [[hold]] 3, and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1. On a miss, you get bad information and [[the Keeper]] decides how that affects you. Spend your [[hold]] to: 
  - have a useful object ready.
  - be somewhere you are needed, just in time.
  - take +1 [[forward]], or give +1 [[forward]] to another hunter.
  - retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesn’t happen.
- **Sacred Oath:** You may bind yourself to a single goal, forsaking something during your quest (e.g. speech, all sustenance but bread and water, alcohol, lying, sex, etc). Get [[the Keeper]]’s agreement on this—it should match the goal in importance and difficulty. While you keep your oath and work towards your goal, mark experience at the end of every session and get +1 on any rolls that directly help achieve the goal. If you break the oath, take -1 [[ongoing]] until you have atoned.
- **Mentor**: You have a mentor in the Sect: name them. When you **contact your mentor for info**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you get an answer to your question, no problem. On a 7-9 you choose: they’re either busy and can’t help, or they answer the question but you owe a favour. On a miss, your question causes trouble.
- **Apprentice**: You have an apprentice: name them. Your job is to teach them the Sect’s ways. They count as an **ally**: **subordinate** (motivation: to follow your instructions to the letter).
- **Helping Hand**: When you successfully **[[help out]]** another hunter, they get +2 instead of the usual +1.
- **That Old Black Magic**: When you **[[use magic]]**, you can ask a question from the **[[investigate a mystery]]** move as your effect.

**SECT**

You are part of an ancient, secret order that slays [[monsters]]. Where are they from? How old are they? Are they religious? Why do they stay secret? How do they recruit?

You also need to pick the Sect’s traditions (these will be used by [[the Keeper]] to determine the Sect’s methods and actions):

**Good Traditions** (pick two):

- Knowledgable
- Ancient lore
- Magical lore
- Fighting arts
- Modernised
- Chapters everywhere
- Secular power
- Flexible tactics
- Open hierarchy
- Integrated in society
- Rich
- Nifty gadgets
- Magical items

**Bad Traditions** (pick one):

- Dubious motives
- Tradition-bound
- Short-sighted
- Paranoid and secretive
- Closed hierarchy
- Factionalised
- Strict laws
- Mystical oaths
- Total obedience
- Tyrannical leaders
- Obsolete [[gear]]
- Poor

**[[GEAR]]**

If the Sect has **fighting arts** or **obsolete [[gear]]**, then pick three old-fashioned [[weapons]]. If the Sect has **modernised** or **nifty gadgets**, you may pick two modern [[weapons]]. Otherwise, pick two old-fashioned [[weapons]] and one modern weapon.

You also get old-fashioned [[armour]] (1-[[armour]] heavy).

Old-fashioned [[weapons]] (pick either two or three, as above):

- Sword (2-[[harm]] hand messy)
- Axe (2-[[harm]] hand messy)
- Big sword (3-[[harm]] hand messy heavy)
- Big axe (3-[[harm]] hand messy slow heavy)

- 9mm (2-[[harm]] close loud)
- Sniper rifle (3-[[harm]] far)
- Magnum (3-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] close messy)

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Initiate by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They are a lay member of your Sect.
- You fought together when the tide of [[monsters]] seemed unstoppable. Ask them how it went.
- Friends, but they first met you under your cover identity, and learned about the Sect later. Ask how they feel about that.
- They are your close relative, or partner/spouse. Decide between you exactly what the relationship is.
- Fellow ancient weapons/martial arts club members.
- They’re described in the prophecies, but the role they will play isn’t stated.
- An ex-member of the Sect, but still friends. Ask them why they left or got thrown out
- You met researching mystical weirdness, and you’ve been occult comrades ever since.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your Luck boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Weird, max +3
- Get +1 Cool, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Get +1 Tough, max +2
- Take another Initiate move
- Take another Initiate move
- Get command of your chapter of the Sect
- Get a Sect team under your command
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Become the leader, or effective leader, of the whole Sect.
