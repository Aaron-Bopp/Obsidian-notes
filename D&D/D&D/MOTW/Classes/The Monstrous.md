# The Monstrous

> I feel the hunger, the lust to destroy. But I fight it: I never give in. I’m not human any more, not really, but I have to protect those who still are. That way I can tell myself I’m different to the other [[monsters]]. Sometimes I can even believe it.

## Monster Breed 

You’re half-human, half-monster: decide if you were always this way or if you you were originally human and transformed somehow.

Now decide if you were always fighting to be good, or if you were evil and changed sides.Define your monstrous breed by picking a curse, [[moves]], and natural attacks.

Create the monster you want to be: [[whatever]] you choose defines your breed in the game. Some classic [[monsters]] with suggestions for picks are listed on the back of this sheet. These are only suggestions: feel free to make a different version

## Curses, Pick One

![[Vulnerability]]

- Base: teeth (3-[[harm]] [[intimate]])
- Base: claws (2-[[harm]] [[hand]])

- Base: [[life-drain]] (1-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[life-drain]])

## History
Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:
- You lost control one time, and almost killed them. Ask them how they stopped you.
- They tried to slay you, but you proved you’re on the side of good. Ask them what convinced them.
- You are romantically obsessed with them. Ask them if they know, and if they reciprocate.
- [[Close]] relations, or a distant descendant. Tell them which.
- You saved them from another of your kind, and prevented reprisals against that individual creature (maybe it’s another good one, or maybe it has a [[hold]] over you).
- They are tied to your curse or origin. Tell them how.
- You fought together against the odds, and prevailed.
- They saved you from another hunter who was prepared to kill you. Ask them what happened.
