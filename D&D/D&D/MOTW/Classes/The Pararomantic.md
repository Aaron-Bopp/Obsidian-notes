# The Pararomantic

*“I sense too much to ever be understood by normal people... and enough to be loved by something else.”*

To make your Pararomantic, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, fate, [[moves]], [[gear]], and your relationship. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**Look, pick one from each list:**

-   Man, woman, boy, girl, concealed, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

-   Friendly face, alluring face, laughing face, trustworthy face, average face, serious face, sensual face, face, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ face.

-   Normal clothes, casual clothes, goth clothes, sporty clothes, street clothes, nerdy clothes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clothes.

**Ratings, pick one line:**

b Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp=0, Tough–1, Weird+1 b Charm+2, Cool–1, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird=0 b Charm+2, Cool+2, Sharp=0, Tough=0, Weird–1 b Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough–1, Weird=0 b Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough–1, Weird=0

## Fate Of Your Love

There is a reason why your love with your Guide (the supernatural being you have a connection with) is forbidden or doomed. Invent this reason or leave it to [[the Keeper]]. Whenever you mark off a point of Luck, the truth of your love’s Fate slowly unfolds: mark off a box in your Relationship Status track. When your last point of Luck is used it becomes clear you cannot be together. Your Guide might even end up as an enemy, depending on how things go.

Whenever you put yourself or somebody else in serious danger in order to conceal the truth about you and your Guide, mark experience.

**Bond Abuse**: Whenever you do something to abuse the bond with your Guide, like acting against them, or not giving them enough attention, roll [[+Charm]]:

-   On 10+, your action has no effect beyond the exchange of some angry words.

-   On 7-9 choose one of the bond abuse options below.

-   On a miss, [[the Keeper]] may choose two of the bond abuse options below, or something worse. **Bond abuse options:**

-   Mark off a box in your Relationship Status track.

-   You may not channel the power of your bond for the rest of the mystery.

-   You gain the unwelcome attention of others of your Guide’s kind.

-   Someone who shouldn’t know finds a clue about your relationship with your Guide.

## Moves

You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus three Pararomantic [[moves]].

You get this one:

B **Supernatural Guide**: You have a (most likely intimate) connection to some supernatural being who is your guide into the world beyond. Choose if your relationship is secret or not.

Determine what kind of creature your Guide is and how your relationship works. Say what kind of power they possess. [[The Keeper]] will decide how it works and define your Guide as a threat.

If your Guide is another hunter, determine together how your relationship works.

Whenever you would roll [[+Weird]] you can roll [[+Charm]] instead, by channeling the power of your bond. When you do so and miss, in addition to the usual consequences, you and your Guide suffer as when you miss a roll for **bond abuse**.

Then pick two of these:

b **Bonding Time**: If you spend some quality time with your Guide instead of working on the current mystery you can roll [[+Charm]].

On 10+, [[hold]] 2. On 7-9, [[hold]] 1. Spend your [[hold]] to:

-   Erase one mark in your Relationship Status track.

-   Use a Pararomantic move you haven’t picked.

-   Receive a gift from your Guide.

-   Take +1 [[forward]].

b **Dark Desires**: You may use the **[[manipulate someone]]** move on [[monsters]], as long as you are using emotional ties.

b **The Power of Love**: When you use **help someone** to help your Guide you don’t have to roll [[+Cool]]. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10. If your Guide is another hunter, the same applies when they help you. b **Do As The Supernatural Do**: You can take an unnatural move from your Guide’s playbook (if they are a hunter). If they are a monster, choose a move from a suitable supernatural playbook. [[The Keeper]] may offer you a custom move, instead.

b **I Am Theirs And They Are Mine**: Whenever you are in danger, your Guide knows it. If your Guide is suffering [[harm]] (and it’s feasible), you can spend a point of Luck to redirect the attack onto yourself as if you have rolled 10+ with **[[protect someone]]**. If you are suffering [[harm]], you can decide that your Guide has protected you and is suffering this [[harm]] instead. If you choose this, roll for **bond abuse**.

b **Monster Empathy**: When you try to work out what a supernatural creature desires, roll [[+Charm]]. On a 10+, [[hold]] 2. On a 7-9, [[hold]] 1. Spend your [[hold]] to ask the following questions—[[the Keeper]] will answer honestly:

-   What does it most desire?

-   What would it accept as good enough for now?

-   What would distract it?

b **Spirit Touched**: Your experiences have made you sensitive to the supernatural. When you sense magical things, roll [[+Weird]]. On a 10+ you can sense them fully. On a 7-9, choose: either sense them fully but they notice you too, or you sense only impressions.

## Gear

Choose two of these normal things:

b Golf club, baseball bat, b Small handgun (2-[[harm]] cricket bat, or hockey close loud reload) stick (2-[[harm]] hand b Bicycle innocuous messy) b Fairly new car in 
b Pocket knife or multitool decent condition (1-[[harm]] hand useful small) b Motorcycle

And choose one gift from your Guide. Whatever gift you choose, it must be periodically recharged by interactions with your Guide. The gifts are:

b Part of their body, e.g. a vial of blood, lock of hair, tears in a phial, fairy dust. It either helps you heal, or counts as a weakness against a specific sort of monster.

b Piece of jewelery, e.g. a golden ring, tribal pendant, silver locket. It either provides 1-[[armour]] magic or protects you from the powers of a specific sort of monster.

b A memento of the time when they were human, e.g. a portrait/ photo from life, diary, favourite hat, doll, or lighter. Provides +1 on **bond abuse** rolls.

b A strange or antique weapon, e.g. a family sword, ancient staff, holy mace (2-[[harm]] hand messy). Additionally, add “magic,” “silver,” “holy,” or “iron” to the weapon.

## Introductions

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Pararomantic by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

-   Your best friend in the world. You trust them totally.

-   You are blood-kin. Decide your exact relationship together.

-   Your ex. Ask them why you aren’t together anymore.

-   Romantic entanglement, or fated to be romantically entangled.

-   They know about some of your dark secrets, but they’ve agreed to keep quiet about them. Tell them what they know.

-   An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship. Ask them what (or who) you once fought over.

-   Mentor from another life. Ask them what they taught you.

## Luck

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Pararomantic Special**: When you spend a point of Luck, also mark off one of your relationship status boxes. [[The Keeper]] will bring **fate of your love** into play.

**Relationship Status**

Loving bbbbbbb Broken

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list.

## Improvements

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 60%" /><col style="width: 39%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p>b Get +1 Charm, max +3 b Get +1 Cool, max +2 b Get +1 Sharp, max +2 b Get +1 Weird, max +2 b Take another</p><blockquote><p>Pararomantic move</p></blockquote></th><th><p>b Take another</p><p>Pararomantic move b Gain an ally b Take a move from another playbook</p><p>b Take a move from another playbook</p></th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re on the next page.
