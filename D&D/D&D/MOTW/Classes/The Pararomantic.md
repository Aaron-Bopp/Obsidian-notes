# The Pararomantic

*“I sense too much to ever be understood by normal people... and enough to be loved by something else.”*

To make your Pararomantic, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, fate, [[moves]], [[gear]], and your relationship. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**Look, pick one from each list:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, concealed, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

- Friendly face, alluring face, laughing face, trustworthy face, average face, serious face, sensual face, face, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ face.

- Normal clothes, casual clothes, goth clothes, sporty clothes, street clothes, nerdy clothes, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clothes.

**Ratings, pick one line:**

-  [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]–1, [[Weird]]+1 b [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]–1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]=0 b [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]+2, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]–1 b [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]–1, [[Weird]]=0 b [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]–1, [[Weird]]=0

## Fate Of Your Love

There is a reason why your love with your Guide (the supernatural being you have a connection with) is forbidden or doomed. Invent this reason or leave it to [[the Keeper]]. Whenever you mark off a point of [[Luck]], the truth of your love’s Fate slowly unfolds: mark off a box in your Relationship Status track. When your last point of [[Luck]] is used it becomes clear you cannot be together. Your Guide might even end up as an enemy, depending on how things go.

Whenever you put yourself or somebody else in serious danger in order to conceal the truth about you and your Guide, mark experience.

**Bond Abuse**: Whenever you do something to abuse the bond with your Guide, like acting against them, or not giving them enough attention, roll +[[Charm]]:

- On 10+, your action has no effect beyond the exchange of some angry words.

- On 7-9 choose one of the bond abuse options below.

- On a miss, [[the Keeper]] may choose two of the bond abuse options below, or something worse. **Bond abuse options:**

- Mark off a box in your Relationship Status track.

- You may not channel the power of your bond for the rest of the mystery.

- You gain the unwelcome attention of others of your Guide’s kind.

- Someone who shouldn’t know finds a clue about your relationship with your Guide.

## Moves

You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus three Pararomantic [[moves]].

You get this one:

- ![[Supernatural Guide]]
- ![[Bonding Time]]
- ![[Dark Desires]]
- ![[The Power of Love]]
- ![[I Am Theirs And They Are Mine]]
- ![[Monster Empathy]]
- ![[Spirit Touched]]
## Gear

Choose two of these normal things:

-  Golf club, baseball bat, b [[Small]] handgun (2-[[harm]] cricket bat, or hockey [[close]] [[loud]] [[reload]]) stick (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] b Bicycle [[innocuous]] [[messy]]) b Fairly new car in

-  Pocket knife or multitool decent condition (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[useful]] [[small]]) b Motorcycle

And choose one gift from your Guide. [[Whatever]] gift you choose, it must be periodically recharged by interactions with your Guide. The gifts are:

-  Part of their body, e.g. a vial of blood, lock of hair, tears in a phial, fairy dust. It either helps you heal, or counts as a weakness against a specific sort of monster.

-  Piece of jewelery, e.g. a golden ring, tribal pendant, silver locket. It either provides 1-[[armour]] [[magic]] or protects you from the powers of a specific sort of monster.

-  A memento of the time when they were human, e.g. a portrait/ photo from life, diary, favourite hat, doll, or lighter. Provides +1 on **bond abuse** rolls.

-  A strange or antique weapon, e.g. a family sword, ancient staff, [[holy]] mace (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]]). Additionally, add “[[magic]],” “silver,” “[[holy]],” or “iron” to the weapon.

## Introductions

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Pararomantic by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- Your best friend in the world. You trust them totally.

- You are blood-kin. Decide your exact relationship together.

- Your ex. Ask them why you aren’t together anymore.

- Romantic entanglement, or fated to be romantically entangled.

- They know about some of your dark secrets, but they’ve agreed to keep quiet about them. Tell them what they know.

- An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship. Ask them what (or who) you once fought over.

- [[Mentor]] from another life. Ask them what they taught you.

## Luck

You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Pararomantic Special**: When you spend a point of [[Luck]], also mark off one of your relationship status boxes. [[The Keeper]] will bring **fate of your love** into play.

## **Relationship Status**


Loving bbbbbbb Broken

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list.

## Improvements

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 60%" /><col style="width: 39%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th><p>b Get +1 [[Charm]], max +3 b Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2 b Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2 b Get +1 [[Weird]], max +2 b Take another</p><blockquote><p>Pararomantic move</p></blockquote></th><th><p>b Take another</p><p>Pararomantic move b Gain an ally b Take a move from another playbook</p><p>b Take a move from another playbook</p></th></tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re on the next page.
