*Your birth was prophesied. You are the Chosen One, and with your abilities you can save the world. If you fail, all will be destroyed. It all rests on you. Only you.*

To make your Chosen, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, fate, [[moves]], [[gear]], and your special weapon. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, androgynous.

## **FATE**


You get to decide what sort of fate is in store for you. Pick how you found out about your fate, from the list below.

**How You Found Out** (pick one):

- Nightmares and visions
- Some weirdo told you
- An ancient cult found you
- Sought out by your nemesis
- Attacked by [[monsters]]
- Trained from birth
- You found the prophecy

Then pick two heroic and two doom tags for your fate from the lists below. This is how your fate will unfold. It’s okay to pick contradictory tags: that means your fate is pulling you both ways.

Whenever you mark off a point of [[Luck]], [[the Keeper]] will throw something from your fate at you.

**Heroic** (pick two):

- Sacrifice
- You are the Champion
- Visions
- Secret training
- Magical powers
- Mystical inheritance
- A normal life
- True love
- You can save the world
- Hidden allies
- The end of [[monsters]]
- Divine help

**Doom** (pick two):

- Death
- You can’t save everyone
- Impossible love
- Failure
- A nemesis
- No normal life
- Loss of loved ones
- Treachery
- Doubt
- Sympathy with the enemy
- Damnation
- Hosts of [[monsters]]
- The end of days
- The source of Evil

## **[[MOVES]]**


*You get all of the basic [[moves]], plus three Chosen [[moves]].*

*You get these two:*

- ![[Destiny’s Plaything]]
- ![[I’m Here For A Reason]]
- ![[The Big Entrance]]
- ![[Devastating]]
- ![[Dutiful]]
- ![[Invincible]]
- ![[Resilience]]
## **[[GEAR]]**


You can have protective [[gear]] worth 1-[[armour]], if you want it.

You have a special weapon you are destined to wield.

## **YOUR SPECIAL WEAPON**


Design your weapon by choosing a form and three business-end options (which are added to the base tags), and [[a material]]. For example, if you want a [[magic]] sword you could choose the following: handle + blade + long + [[magic]].

**Form** (choose 1):

- staff (1-[[harm]] hand close)
- haft (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[heavy]])
- handle (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[balanced]])
- chain (1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[area]])

**Business-end** (choose 3 options):

- artifact (add the “[[magic]]” tag)
- spikes (+1 [[harm]], add the “[[messy]]” tag)
- blade (+1 [[harm]])
- [[heavy]] (+1 [[harm]])
- long (add the “[[close]]” tag)
- throwable (add the “[[close]]” tag)
- chain (add the “[[area]]” tag)

**Material** (choose 1):

Finally, pick what material the business-end is made from: add “steel,” “cold iron,” “silver,” “wood,” “stone,” “bone,” “teeth,” “obsidian,” or anything else you want.

Material:

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Chosen by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- You are [[close]] blood relations. Ask them exactly how [[close]].
- They are destined to be your [[Mentor]]. Tell them how this was revealed.
- Your best friend in the world, who you trust totally.
- A rival at first, but you came to a working arrangement.
- Romantic entanglement, or fated to be romantically entangled.
- Just friends, from school or work or something. Ask them what.
- They could have been the Chosen One instead of you, but they failed some trial. Tell them how they failed.
- You saved their life, back when they didn’t know [[monsters]] were real. Tell them what you saved them from.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

**Chosen special**: When you spend a point of [[Luck]], [[the Keeper]] will bring your fate into play.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Charm]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Tough]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +3
- Take another Chosen move
- Take another Chosen move
- Gain an ally
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Delete one of your Doom tags, and (optionally) one of your Heroic tags. You have changed that aspect of your destiny.
