*I have dedicated my life to the study of the unnatural. I know their habits, their weaknesses. I may not be youngest or strongest, but my knowledge makes me the biggest threat.*

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Expert by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- They are your student, [[Apprentice]], ward, or child. Between you, decide which.
- They came to you for advice, and your advice got them out of trouble. Ask them what the trouble was.
- They know about some of your dark secrets, but they’ve agreed to keep quiet about them. Tell them what they know.
- A distant relation. Tell them exactly what.
- You were previously both members of an eldritch group, now disbanded. Ask them why *they* left, then tell them why *you* did.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].
