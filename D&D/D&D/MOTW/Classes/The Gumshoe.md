# The Gumshoe
![[image38.png]]

> “You won’t understand this… When I take a case, I’m supposed to do something about it. You’re supposed to do something about it whether you like it or not. You’ve got to pay for what you’ve done, sweetheart, whatever it is I might feel about you. Yes, I’ll have some bad nights, but I’ll still have myself.” 


To make your Gumshoe, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Code, [[moves]], and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

**Look, pick one from each list:**

-   Man, woman, ambiguous, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

-   Angelic face, unshaven face, handsomely devilish face, world-weary face, sly face, streetwise face, quiet face, knowing face, watchful face, merry face, obvious ex-cop face, hunted face, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ face.

-   Nondescript clothes, tailored clothes and sunglasses, vintage clothes, fashion clothes, fedora and trench coat, California casual, biker clothes, Pacific island casual, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clothes.

**Ratings, Pick one line:**

b Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird=0 b Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird–1 b Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough+1, Weird–1 b Charm+1, Cool–1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird=+1 b Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird–1

## Gumshoe Code

With the agreement of [[the Keeper]], pick a one-sentence Code that your Gumshoe adheres to.

**Example Codes:** *Murders must be punished. [[Monsters]] must be destroyed. Innocents must be saved. Laws must be enforced. Evil must be exposed. Contracts must be honored. Cases must be solved. The weak must be protected from the powerful. Corruption and treachery must be exposed to the light.*

This Code defines your Gumshoe. Any time you violate your code you forfeit all Code related [[moves]] (**The Postman Always Rings Twice**, **The Long Goodbye**) and the ability to spend Luck points. These forfeits last either until the next mystery or you make amends (whichever comes

first). As long as you follow the Code people will sense your sincerity: you receive +1 [[ongoing]] for **[[manipulate someone]]** and you may not be possessed or charmed by any sort of supernatural, alien, or demonic entity or item.

## Moves

You get all the basic [[moves]], and three Gumshoe [[moves]]. You get these two:

B **Occult Confidential**: The first time in each mystery that you observe a monster, minion, or phenomenon in action, you may ask one question from the **[[investigate a mystery]]** list.

B **The Naked City**: You have lots of personal contacts wherever you go. Pick four contact types from the following areas (or from other areas agreed to between you and [[the Keeper]]):

Academics, Accountants, Artists, Bartenders, Clergy, Conspiracy

Theorists, Construction, Courts, Criminals (organised), Criminals

(street), Cultists, Engineers, Espionage, Film and TV, Forensic Scientists, Fringe Scientists, Hackers, Journalists, Lawyers,

Mechanics, Media, Medical Practioners, Military, Morgue, Occult,

Police (local), Police (national), Politicians, Prisons, Private

Security, Property Developers, Stage Magicians, Technologists,

Transportation

You can hit them up for info (+1 to one **[[investigate a mystery]]** roll) or small favours—but there may be a small cost involved. Personal contacts can provide more significant help but [[the Keeper]] decides their price on a case-by-case basis.

Then pick one of these:

b **The Postman Always Rings Twice**: Twice per mystery—as long as you follow your Code—you may reroll a roll.

b **The Long Goodbye**: You can’t die with an open case (usually your current mystery). Specifically, you suffer all [[harm]] as normal but your death is postponed until you have either completed or abandoned the case, or you break your Code (then all bets are off). b **Jessica Jones Entry**: When you double-talk your way into a secure location, roll [[+Charm]].

On a 10+ pick three, on a 7-9 pick two, on a fail pick one:

-   You don’t leave any trace of what you searched.

-   You find what you wanted.

-   You find something else that’s important.

-   You don’t piss anyone off.

-   You aren’t recognised.

b **Out of the Past**: You have a police buddy who will do you big favors. Get in touch with them when you need to redirect law enforcement attention, get a heads-up on what operations are planned, or access police files. You now owe them: expect them to collect on it soon.

b **Asphalt Jungle**: You heal faster than normal people. Any time your [[harm]] gets healed, heal an extra point. You are immune to all the [[harm]] move effects under ‘0-[[harm]]’ and ‘1-[[harm]]’ (when [[the Keeper]] would apply these, you ignore it).

b **Hacker with a Dragon Tattoo**: When you hack into a computer system, roll [[+Sharp]]. On 10+ pick two, on a 7-9 pick one:

-   You leave no traces.

-   You learn something important.

-   You can leave misinformation in place.

-   You gain access to somewhere you want to get in to.

b **“Just one more thing”**: When you ask a suspect leading questions, roll [[+Charm]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 2, on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1, on a miss [[hold]] 1 but something bad is going to happen too.

Spend your [[hold]] to ask questions from this list:

-   One question from the **[[investigate a mystery]]** list.

-   Was that a lie?

-   What is something you left out that you didn’t want me to notice?

-   Are you complicit with any [[ongoing]] criminal activity?

-   Did you commit this specific crime?

## Gear

You get a laptop, a liquor flask, two recording devices, and one P.I. weapon. 

**Recording devices (pick two):**

b Night vision camera b Tiny digital video camera b Film camera (8mm or 16mm) b Digital sound recorder b Cassette tape recorder b Remote-controlled camera drone

**P .I . [[Weapons]] (pick one):**

b Laser microphone b SLR camera

b Brass knuckles (1-[[harm]] hand small)

b .38 revolver (2-[[harm]] close reload loud)

b 9mm (2-[[harm]] close loud)

b Magnum (3-[[harm]]

close reload loud)

b Shotgun (3-[[harm]] close messy loud)

b Switchblade (1-[[harm]] hand small)

## Introductions

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Gumshoe by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

-   You are on the same (or rival) bowling teams. Ask them what bowling-related disagreement rubbed them the wrong way.

-   You caught them committing a crime but let them go. Ask them to describe the crime, then you explain why your Code required you to look the other way.

-   They remind you of a former partner who was mysteriously murdered. Describe the unsolved case that killed your partner and how you hope to solve it.

-   You first approached them for help on a case. Describe the case. Ask them to describe the key expertise they provided that solved that mystery.

-   You were friends back in training, before you became a private investigator. This could be military, law enforcement, or whatever— decide the details between you.

-   Ask them if they live by a code and what it is. If you approve of the code, you’ve always respected them. If not (or if they don’t have a code), you’ve never trusted them.

-   They hired you for a job but you were too drunk or high to take it. Ask them what they wanted, then tell them how you brushed them off.

-   You first met on an unsolved crimes website. Decide together what infamous crime fascinates you both.

## Luck

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a

12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as just 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Gumshoe Special**: When you use a point of Luck your next regular case will actually be a mystery for your hunter group, not a regular case at all (and the monster will focus its attention on you!)

## Harm

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Leveling Up

Experience: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the list below.

## Improvements

b Get +1 Charm, max +3 b Get +1 Cool, max +2 b Get +1 Sharp, max +3 b Get +1 Tough, max +2 b Take another Gumshoe move. b Take another Gumshoe move. b Add another [[harm]] box to your track, before Dying. b Get a haven (your office, perhaps), like [[The Expert]] has, with two options. b Add four additional or new contacts for your **Naked City** move.

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**Advanced [[Improvements]]** b Get +1 to any rating, max +3. b Change this hunter to a new type. b Make up a second hunter to play as well as this one.

b Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.

b Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced. b Turn one of your contacts into an ally.

b Retire this hunter to safety. b Erase one used Luck mark from your playbook.
