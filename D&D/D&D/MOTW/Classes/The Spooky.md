*I can do things, things that normal people can’t. But there’s a price—I [[haven]]’t paid it in full, yet, but the bill’s gonna come due soon. It’s best I don’t tell you any more. You get too [[close]], you’ll get hurt.*

To make your Spooky, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], dark side and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG15.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST**:

- Man, woman, boy, girl, concealed, androgynous.
- Burning eyes, dark eyes, pained eyes, blank eyes, unblinking eyes, piercing eyes, shadowed eyes, creepy eyes.
- Ratty clothes, casual clothes, goth clothes, neat clothes, nerdy clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE**:

- [[Charm]]+1, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]+1, [[Sharp]]=0, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]+2, [[Cool]]=0, [[Sharp]]-1, [[Tough]]-1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]=0, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+1, [[Tough]]+1, [[Weird]]+2
- [[Charm]]-1, [[Cool]]-1, [[Sharp]]+2, [[Tough]]=0, [[Weird]]+2

## **[[MOVES]]**


*You get all the basic [[moves]], plus pick three Spooky [[moves]]:*

- ![[Telepathy]]
- ![[Hex]]
- ![[The Sight]]
- ![[Premonitions]]
- ![[Hunches]]
- ![[Tune In]]
- ![[The Big Whammy]]
- ![[Jinx]]
## **THE DARK SIDE**


Your powers have an unsavory source, and sometimes you get tempted to do things you shouldn’t. These could be orders from [[whatever]] granted your power, or urges that bubble up from your subconscious. Something like that. [[Whatever]] it is, it’s unsettling.

*Pick three tags for your dark side:*

- Violence
- Depression
- Secrets
- Lust
- Dark bargain
- Guilt
- Soulless
- Addiction
- Mood swings
- Rage
- Self-destruction
- Greed for power
- Poor impulse control
- Hallucinations
- Pain
- Paranoia

[[The Keeper]] can ask you to do nasty things (in accordance with the tags), when your powers need you to. If you do [[whatever]] is asked, mark experience. If you don’t do it, then your powers are unavailable until the end of the mystery (or until you cave). As you mark off [[Luck]] boxes, these requests will get bigger and nastier.

## **[[GEAR]]**


You get two normal [[weapons]] and any magical items or amulets that you use to invoke your powers.

Normal [[weapons]] (pick two):

- .38 revolver (2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[reload]] [[loud]])
- 9mm (2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[loud]])
- Hunting rifle (2-[[harm]] [[far]] [[loud]])
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[messy]])
- Big knife (1-[[harm]] [[hand]])

## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Spooky by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each hunter:

- They taught you to control your powers, to the extent that you can control them at all.
- You are blood-kin. Decide together exactly what.
- You are married, or romantically involved. Decide between you the exact relationship.
- You’re old friends, and trust each other completely.
- You used your powers on them one time. Decide if it was for selfish reasons or not, and tell them if they found out about it.
- You’ve known each other some time, but since your powers manifested, you keep them at a distance emotionally.
- You hope they can help you control your powers.
- They saw you use your powers for selfish or vindictive reasons. Ask them who the victim was, and then tell them what you did.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your [[Luck]] boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] Doomed

**Spooky special**: As you mark off [[Luck]] boxes, your dark side’s needs will get nastier.

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay [ ][ ][ ]|[ ][ ][ ][ ] Dying

- [ ] [[Unstable]]:  *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- [ ] Get +1 [[Weird]], max +3
- [ ] Get +1 [[Charm]], max +2
- [ ] Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- [ ] Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2
- [ ] Take another Spooky move
- [ ] Take another Spooky move
- [ ] Change some, or all, your dark side tags
- [ ] Get a mystical library, like [[The Expert]]’s [[haven]] option
- [ ] Take a move from another playbook
- [ ] Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- [ ] Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- [ ] Change this hunter to a new type.
- [ ] Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- [ ] Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- [ ] Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- [ ] Retire this hunter to safety.
- [ ] You discover how to use your powers at a lower price. Delete one dark side tag permanently.
