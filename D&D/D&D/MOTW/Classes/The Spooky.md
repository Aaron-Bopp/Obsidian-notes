*I can do things, things that normal people can’t. But there’s a price—I haven’t paid it in full, yet, but the bill’s gonna come due soon. It’s best I don’t tell you any more. You get too close, you’ll get hurt.*

To make your Spooky, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, [[moves]], dark side and [[gear]]. Finally, introduce yourself and pick [[history]].

![](MotWIMG15.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, boy, girl, concealed, androgynous.
- Burning eyes, dark eyes, pained eyes, blank eyes, unblinking eyes, piercing eyes, shadowed eyes, creepy eyes.
- Ratty clothes, casual clothes, goth clothes, neat clothes, nerdy clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm-1, Cool+1, Sharp=0, Tough+1, Weird+2
- Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp-1, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird+2
- Charm-1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird+2

**[[MOVES]]**

*You get all the basic [[moves]], plus pick three Spooky [[moves]]:*

- **Telepathy:** You can read people’s thoughts and put words in their mind. This can allow you to **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** or **[[Read A Bad Situation]]** without needing to actually talk. You can also **[[Manipulate Someone]]** without speaking. You still roll [[moves]] as normal, except people will not expect the weirdness of your mental communication.
- **Hex:** When you cast a spell (with **[[Use Magic]]**), as well as the normal effects, you may pick from the following: 
  - The target contracts a disease.
  - The target immediately suffers [[harm]] (2-[[harm]] magic ignore-

    [[armour]]).
  - The target breaks something precious or important.
- **The Sight:** You can see the invisible, especially spirits and magical influences. You may communicate with (maybe even make deals with) the spirits you see, and they give you more opportunities to spot clues when you **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**.
- **Premonitions:** **At the start of each mystery**, roll +Weird. On a 10+, you get a detailed vision of something bad that is yet to happen. You take +1 [[forward]] to prevent it coming true, and mark experience if you stop it. On a 7-9+ you get clouded images of something bad that is yet to happen: mark experience if you stop it. On a miss, you get a vision of something bad happening to you and [[the Keeper]] holds 3, to be spent one-for-one as penalties to rolls you make.
- **Hunches:** **When something bad is happening** (or just about to happen) somewhere that you aren’t, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you knew where you needed to go, just in time to get there. On a 7-9, you get there late—in time to intervene, but not prevent it altogether. On a miss, you get there just in time to be in trouble yourself.
- **Tune In**: You can **attune your mind to a monster or minion**. Roll +Weird. On a 10+, [[hold]] 3. On a 7-9, [[hold]] 1. On a miss, the monster becomes aware of you. Spend one [[hold]] to ask [[the Keeper]] one of the following questions, and gain +1 [[ongoing]] while acting on the answers: 
  - *Where is the creature right now?*
  - *What is it planning to do right now?*
  - *Who is it going to attack next?*
  - *Who does it regard as the biggest threat?*
  - *How can I attract its attention?*
- **The Big Whammy**: You can use your powers to **[[kick some ass]]:** roll +Weird instead of +Tough. The attack has 2-[[harm]] close obvious ignore-[[armour]]. On a miss, you’ll get a magical backlash.
- **Jinx**: You can encourage coincidences to occur, the way you want. **When you jinx a target**, roll +Weird. On a 10+ [[hold]] 2 and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1. On a miss, [[the Keeper]] holds 2 over you to be used in the same way. Spend your [[hold]] to: 
  - Interfere with a hunter, giving them -1 [[forward]].
  - Help a hunter, giving them +1 [[forward]], by interfering with their enemy.
  - Interfere with what a monster, minion, or bystander is trying to do.
  - Inflict 1-[[harm]] on the target due to an accident.
  - The target finds something you left for them.
  - The target loses something that you will soon find.

**THE DARK SIDE**

Your powers have an unsavory source, and sometimes you get tempted to do things you shouldn’t. These could be orders from whatever granted your power, or urges that bubble up from your subconscious. Something like that. Whatever it is, it’s unsettling.

*Pick three tags for your dark side:*

- Violence
- Depression
- Secrets
- Lust
- Dark bargain
- Guilt
- Soulless
- Addiction
- Mood swings
- Rage
- Self-destruction
- Greed for power
- Poor impulse control
- Hallucinations
- Pain
- Paranoia

[[The Keeper]] can ask you to do nasty things (in accordance with the tags), when your powers need you to. If you do whatever is asked, mark experience. If you don’t do it, then your powers are unavailable until the end of the mystery (or until you cave). As you mark off Luck boxes, these requests will get bigger and nastier.

**[[GEAR]]**

You get two normal [[weapons]] and any magical items or amulets that you use to invoke your powers.

Normal [[weapons]] (pick two):

- .38 revolver (2-[[harm]] close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-[[harm]] close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-[[harm]] far loud)
- Shotgun (3-[[harm]] close messy)
- Big knife (1-[[harm]] hand)

**[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Spooky by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**[[HISTORY]]**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each hunter:

- They taught you to control your powers, to the extent that you can control them at all.
- You are blood-kin. Decide together exactly what.
- You are married, or romantically involved. Decide between you the exact relationship.
- You’re old friends, and trust each other completely.
- You used your powers on them one time. Decide if it was for selfish reasons or not, and tell them if they found out about it.
- You’ve known each other some time, but since your powers manifested, you keep them at a distance emotionally.
- You hope they can help you control your powers.
- They saw you use your powers for selfish or vindictive reasons. Ask them who the victim was, and then tell them what you did.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If all your Luck boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**Spooky special:** As you mark off Luck boxes, your dark side’s needs will get nastier.

**[[HARM]]**

When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**[[LEVELING UP]]**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 Weird, max +3
- Get +1 Charm, max +2
- Get +1 Cool, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Take another Spooky move
- Take another Spooky move
- Change some, or all, your dark side tags
- Get a mystical library, like [[The Expert]]’s haven option
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- You discover how to use your powers at a lower price. Delete one dark side tag permanently.
