## **[[INTRODUCTIONS]]**


When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your [[introductions]] together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Wronged by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## **[[HISTORY]]**


Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They helped you at a critical point in your quest for revenge. Tell them what you needed help with.
- They stood between you and what you needed to find out. Ask them why.
- They also lost a friend or relative to these [[monsters]]. Ask them who it was.
- Relations, [[close]] or distant. Tell them exactly what.
- You saved their life, back when they were a pathetic newbie hunter. Ask them what you saved them from.
- You respect their hard-earned knowledge, and often come to them for advice.
- They showed you the ropes when you were learning how to fight.
- They saw you absolutely lose it and go [[Berserk]]. Tell them what the situation was, and ask them how much collateral damage you caused.

## **LUCK**


You can mark off a [[Luck]] box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-[[harm]], no matter how bad it was. If your [[Luck]] boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good [[luck]].

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

## **[[HARM]]**


When you suffer [[harm]], mark off the number of boxes equal to [[harm]] suffered. When you reach four [[harm]], tick “[[Unstable]].”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

[[Unstable]]: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

## **[[LEVELING UP]]**


*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## **[[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 [[Tough]], max +3
- Get +1 [[Cool]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Sharp]], max +2
- Get +1 [[Weird]], max +2
- Take another Wronged move
- Take another Wronged move
- Gain a [[haven]], like [[The Expert]] has, with two options
- Add one more option to your [[haven]]
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for [[advanced improvements]] in addition to these. They’re below.

## **ADVANCED [[IMPROVEMENTS]]**


- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic [[moves]] as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- You track down the specific monster(s) responsible for your loss. [[The Keeper]] must make the next mystery about them.
- Change the target of your vengeful rage. Pick a new monster breed: **[[I Know My Prey]]** now applies to them instead.
