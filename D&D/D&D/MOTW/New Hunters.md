# New Hunters

The following pages include four new hunter types for your games. They are:

**The Gumshoe:** The supernatural is just another case for this private eye to solve. A tough, ethical charmer, this shamus is in the fictional tradition that stretches from classic noir characters like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe to the modern Jessica Jones and Lisbeth Salander.

**The Hex:** A witch motivated by the pursuit of forbidden power, using magic more readily—and more recklessly—than other hunters. E.g. Willow during season six of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.

**The Pararomantic:** A hunter with a loving—but difficult— relationship with a supernatural being. Understands monsters’ intentions and can earn their trust, but puts their own heart, and even mortality, at risk. E.g. Elena Gilbert from *The Vampire Diaries*, Belle from *Beauty and the Beast*.


**The Searcher:** After an encounter with weirdness, they dedicated their life to investigating the unexplained. Very strong investigator, especially at working out what sort of thing is going on. Not really a fighter, but has some defensive options. E.g. Roy Neary in *Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, or (historically) Charles Fort.
