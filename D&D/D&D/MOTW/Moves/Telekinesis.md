## Telekinesis

When you **fling something with your mind**, roll [[+Weird]]:

- On a *10+*, you move it. Choose two options and mark 1-[[harm]].
- On a *7-9*, you move it but it hurts. Choose one option and mark 2-[[harm]].
- On a *6-*, something goes horribly wrong.

By default you can move something smaller than a person. You don’t have much control, and you can’t move it strongly enough to hurt anything.

**Telekinesis options** (anything not picked is not true):
- Something is held fast.
- Something is hurt (2-[[harm]] smash).
- Something catches fire.
- You can fling something bigger than a person.
- You keep it basically under your control.
- You suffer 1 less [[harm]].

**Advanced Telekinesis .** When you advance your **telekinesis** move, add this:
- On a *12+*, choose three options. You may also choose from these advanced options:
- Something explodes (3-[[harm]] close fire area messy) • Something implodes (3-[[harm]] close crush) • Lots of stuff is flying under your control.
- You have perfect and precise control over exactly what happens.
