When you look around and **read a bad situation**, roll [[+Sharp]].

On a 10+ [[hold]] 3, and on a 7-9, [[hold]] 1.

One [[hold]] can be spent to ask [[the Keeper]] one of the following questions:

- *What’s my best way in?*
- *What’s my best way out?*
- *Are there any dangers we haven’t noticed?*
- *What’s the biggest threat?*
- *What’s most vulnerable to me?*
- *What’s the best way to protect the victims?*

**If you act on the answers**, you get +1 [[ongoing]] while the information is relevant. For example, if you ask for the best way into the monster’s lair then you’ll get +1 while you are infiltrating it. But once you’re in, the information doesn’t help you any more. The bonus is only applied once on each roll, even if more than one question applies to your course of action.

On a miss, you might mis-read the situation (e.g. “Everything is fine here! It will be totally safe to go investigate alone!”), or you might reveal tactical details to your enemies (which means [[the Keeper]] can ask the questions above of you).

This move is for when a hunter goes into a situation they know is hostile—e.g. when they know the monster’s in this house somewhere. It can also be used in the middle of a dangerous situation, if the hunter needs some more tactical information.

Misses on **reading a bad situation** lend themselves to you turning the move back on the hunter—ask them some of the questions on behalf of whatever enemies are present, and then have the enemies act on those answers.

Misses can also give you a chance to put [[the hunters]] into danger—for example, they just failed to notice the ambush they’re walking into.
