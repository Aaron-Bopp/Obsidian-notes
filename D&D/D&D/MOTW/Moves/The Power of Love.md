 When you use **help someone** to help your Guide you don’t have to roll +[[Cool]]. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10. If your Guide is another hunter, the same applies when they help you. b **Do As The Supernatural Do**: You can take an unnatural move from your Guide’s playbook (if they are a hunter). If they are a monster, choose a move from a suitable supernatural playbook. [[The Keeper]] may offer you a custom move, instead.
