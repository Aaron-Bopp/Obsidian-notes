 When you grab a nearby large object and use it as an improvised weapon, first determine how much damage it will do. Guidelines:
 
- [[Fire]] extinguisher, fence post, furniture, etc:     2-[[harm]]

- Motorcycle, lamppost, masonry chunk, etc:     3-[[harm]]

- Car, dumpster, boulder, etc: 4-[[harm]]

- Bus, truck, wall, etc: 5-[[harm]]
After you inflict [[harm]] with it (with a [[kick some ass]] move or otherwise), roll +[[harm]] inflicted. On a miss, you use it without trouble. On a 7-9, pick one side effect, and on a 10+ pick two:

- You hurt someone nearby as well as your target

- You make something about the situation worse

- You lose control of your improvised weapon

- You cause massive property damage

- Your improvised weapon breaks
