If someone is about to suffer [[harm]] and you can somehow prevent it, then you can try to protect them.

When you **prevent [[harm]] to another character**, roll [[+Tough]].

On any success (i.e., 7 or more), you protect them okay, but you’ll suffer some or all of the [[harm]] they were going to get.

If you got a 10+ choose an extra:

- You suffer little [[harm]] (-1 [[harm]]).
- All impending danger is now focused on you.
- You inflict [[harm]] on the enemy.
- You [[hold]] the enemy back.

On a miss, then you end up making things worse.


This can be used any time someone is about to suffer [[harm]], including as the result of another move (i.e. a **[[kick some ass]]** move that means a hunter is going to suffer [[harm]]).

As with **[[Help Out]]**, always ask the hunter how they are going to protect *this* person in *this* situation.

By default, any success means that the hunter has successfully protected the target (so the target is not harmed at all) but the hunter will suffer [[harm]] instead (usually, but not always, the same [[harm]]).

On a 10+ the hunter gets to pick an extra effect. Ask the hunter what happened.

They can choose to suffer little [[harm]], taking one less [[harm]]. Ask what they do to reduce the [[harm]].

If they choose “All impending danger is now focused on the hunter,” they’ve put themselves right in [[harm]]’s way. Ask them what they do to get all the danger. Don’t be shy when this is picked: the hunter has *chosen* to have the entire enemy force have a go at them.

If they choose to “inflict [[harm]] on the enemy,” they get to [[harm]] an enemy as well as protecting the target. Ask how they did that. As usual, the amount of [[harm]] done depends on the hunter’s weapon.

If they choose “[[Hold]] the enemy back” then the bad guys can’t get past the hunter. Other hunters, or even [[bystanders]], may help fight from this position if it makes sense. This works best when defending a small space like a doorway. If [[the hunters]] are in the open, the bad guys will be able to work their way around them eventually.

Missing a **protect someone** roll is very bad. In general, [[harm]] to both the original victim and the hunter is a good choice. Things could be even worse, e.g. the target might be captured as well. As with **[[kick some ass]]**, when things go bad here, they go *really* bad. Feel free to inflict [[harm]] as established and follow up with a hard move.
