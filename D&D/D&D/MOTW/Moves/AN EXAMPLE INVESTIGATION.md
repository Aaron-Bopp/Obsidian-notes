Here’s an example showing how an investigation scene might play out.

Our cast is:

- Mary, playing Mark (a Wronged hunter).
- Chris, playing Cray (a Spooky hunter).
- Alan, [[the Keeper]] (who is also playing Officer Hannah Tarlton, a bystander, whose motivation is to join the hunt).

The investigation:

*Hannah has brought [[the hunters]] to the place she saw an attack take place. [[The hunters]] are posing as FBI agents.*

**Alan** (speaking as Hannah): *“Right, here’s where it happened,” says Hannah, “You can see the blood on the wall there. Our witness said the attacker ran off down that alley and over a fence.”*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“You mind if I take some samples?” Then I just start, without waiting for permission.*

**Alan** (speaking as Hannah): *“Uh, sure. Forensics are already taking a look at it.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“So, what did the witness have to say about the attacker? I’m interested in anything, even if it’s kinda weird.”*

**Alan:** *Okay, roll* ***[[investigate a mystery]]*** *for me.*

*Mary rolls the dice and adds Mark’s Sharp.*

**Mary:** *I got a nine. One question?*

**Alan:** *Well, you already asked about the witness seeing anything weird, so I figure you’re interested in its powers?*

**Mary:** *Definitely.*

**Alan:** *Okay, Hannah says “Well, the guy claimed that the attacker just vaulted over that fence down there. But he’d been drinking.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“Right. Witnesses, huh?”*

**Chris:** *While they are chatting I want to test the bloodstains to work out what it is.*

**Alan:** *Um, how do you test a bloodstain for what kind of monster attacked?*

**Chris:** *I’m going to get out my chemistry test kit and try the samples with, like, silver to see if there’s a reaction that you might see from werewolf blood, or if there’s sulphur present that might mean it was a demon, or if it reacts to holy water, that could be a vampire or demon blood. That sort of thing.*

**Alan:** *I guess that might work. But only for things you could learn from the bloodstains—and it seems to be mainly human blood, maybe all human. Roll it.*

*Chris rolls the dice and adds Cray’s Sharp.*

**Chris:** *Yeah, a twelve. First question: what is it?*

**Alan:** *Okay, you find a couple of splashes of blood that are a slightly different colour—more richly red, and slower drying. They react to the holy water test, and let’s say you had garlic in there too. The blood starts smoldering in contact with both. So a vampire, most likely.*

**Chris:** *Vampire. Got it. In that case, next question is “what can it do?”*

**Alan:** *How are you going to find that out from bloodstains?*

**Chris:** *Remember how I spent all that time researching vampires for the case last month? I know that turned out to be a chupacabra, but I still read all those books.*

**Alan:** *Okay, so we flash back to you going over all those old books, and you’re making a list of vampire powers on a pad: super strength, fast, mesmerism, rapid [[healing]] are the things you wrote on the list. Hannah says “So, you finished your tests and everything? I have a job to do here.”*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“Yes, that’s everything for now. Thanks for your help.”*

**Alan:** *Cool, she gets back to her own work. What do you do now?*
