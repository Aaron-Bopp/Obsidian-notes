base class: [[The Hard Case]]
---
** When you have [[Fire]] remaining and strike a foe for 3-[[harm]] or more, tell [[the Keeper]] how much [[Fire]] you have and ask if thatâ€™s enough. If the foe has that much or less [[harm]] capacity left, [[the Keeper]] will tell you. You may spend all your [[Fire]] immediately to make a follow up attack, defeating your foe.
