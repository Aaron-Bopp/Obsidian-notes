### How it works

- roll *+[[Sharp]]* when investigating a mystery
    - On a *10+* [[hold]] 2
    - On a *7-9* [[hold]] 1
    - Use [[hold]] to ask the following questions ^68a031
        - What happened here?
        - What sort of creature is it?
        - What can it do?
        - What can hurt it?
        - Where did it go?
        - What was it going to do?
        - What is being concealed here?
    - **Advanced**: On a *12+*, you may ask [[the Keeper]] any question you want about the mystery, not just the listed ones.

- Alternative more flexible rules
	- On a *10+* ask two general questions and one specific
	- On a *7-9* ask one general question
	- On a miss, ask a general question and something bad happens
	- **Advanced**: -   On a *12+* you may ask one additional question—specific or general

**[[The Keeper]] may ask, “How do you find that out?” If you don’t have a good answer, choose another question instead.**

See [[AN EXAMPLE INVESTIGATION]]

### Will it work?

Investigating can be done any number of ways: following tracks, interviewing witnesses, forensic analysis, looking up old folklore in a library, typing the monster’s name into Google, capturing the monster and conducting tests on it, and so on. Anything that might give you more information about what’s going on is fair game for an investigate move.

**The move covers any investigation technique [[the hunters]] can think of**: interviewing witnesses, sending monster DNA to the lab, tracking it through the alleys, looking at a dead body and reconstructing what happened, looking through ancient tomes of monster lore, and hacking into police databases. These are all legitimate ways to investigate.

Ask yourself, “Could they conceivably find anything [[useful]] that way?” If the answer is “Yes,” tell them to go ahead. If the answer is “No” then ask, “How would you find that out?” If they have a good reply, let them know the answer. If there still isn’t a way to find out, you can ask them to pick a different question instead.

### When is it used

The **investigate a mystery** move will be used frequently. When [[the hunters]] begin each new mystery, they will have (at best) a vague idea of what they’re hunting. Investigation is the main way to find out what’s going on, where the monster is, who they need to protect, and anything else they need to know.

It’s important that you give [[the hunters]] as [[many]] clues as you can. It’s easy to make [[the hunters]] work hard to discover the details of the mystery. But that isn’t part of your agenda. Every success on an **investigate** move should give [[the hunters]] something solid. You should also be generous with obvious details, even on a miss. We play to find out what [[the hunters]] do once they’ve uncovered the mysteries, not how they do it. The **investigate** move is a way for you give them the information they need to decide.

For example, if a hunter is **investigating** by looking at the body of a monster victim, you should describe the state of the body first. “It’s been ripped apart, looks like it went for the heart. The heart is missing.” Those details don’t require a move, because they’re obvious and don’t address the **investigate** questions directly. If the hunter then gets a success on the roll, they may ask you to tell them about the creature’s powers—that’s something that requires careful analysis of the scene and injuries.

In all other ways, the more flexible variant of the **Investigate A Mystery** move works just the same as the original.

### When it succeeds

It’s important that your attempts to investigate (and the results you get from them) are plausible and consistent with what’s happening. For example, if you’re using laboratory equipment to investigate evidence, you probably won’t be able to learn anything about the monster’s magical origins. [[The Keeper]] is obliged to answer truthfully, but not necessarily in full—just what you can work out in your current situation and using your current methods. [[The Keeper]] may choose to describe how something you’ve just discovered relates to something you [[learned]] previously.

What a hunter discovers still depends on the evidence that is (or could be) present and how they are investigating it. Hunters cannot get answers to questions that do not fit with the investigation techniques they’ve used, nor can they discover things if there’s no way that relevant evidence could be at this scene.

Sometimes the answer to one of the questions will be a negative, such as when you are asked for more about the creature’s weaknesses when [[the hunters]] have already discovered them all. In these cases, make it clear that they know this. “Your hours poring over the books tell you that the creature has no more weaknesses.”

It’s okay to tell the player the method they are using uncovers no evidence of the type they are looking for. If this lack of evidence is, itself, an important discovery then using up a question is well worth it. If the lack of evidence is not significant, don’t count the question for the purposes of the move. Let the hunter ask another.

### When it fails

On a miss, you reveal some information to the monster or whoever you are talking to. [[The Keeper]] might ask you some questions, which you have to answer.

**Misses** for this move lend themselves to trouble with normal people (e.g. annoying the witness; being caught stealing evidence, etc) or giving away information to their enemies (e.g. the monster or [[minions]] hear about questions being asked; [[the hunters]] are observed in their evidence collection; etc).
