## Illuminated

You have become enlightened, and sometimes receive information telepathically from the Secret Masters.

The Secret Masters are the benevolent conspiracy fighting to make society (or the universe) perfect. At least, that’s what they told you.

Sometimes, at [[the Keeper]]’s discretion, they proactively send you information, advice, or orders.

When you **telepathically ask the Secret Masters for aid**, roll +[[Weird]]:

- On a *10+*, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you.
- On a *7-9*, the Secret Masters need you to complete a task for them. Once it is done, they reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you.
- On a *6-*, the Secret Masters’ reply is terrible, garbled, or somehow dangerously wrong.

**Advanced Illuminated .** When you advance your **illuminated** move, add this:
- On a *12+*, the Secret Masters reveal a key fact, clue, or technique that will help you. You may ask one follow-up question that [[the Keeper]] will answer honestly.

**Keeper:** Create the Secret Masters as a threat—consider using the new conspiracy ‘Phenomenon’ type (page 24). If more than one hunter is **illuminated**, the group decides if all the Secret Masters are united or at odds.
