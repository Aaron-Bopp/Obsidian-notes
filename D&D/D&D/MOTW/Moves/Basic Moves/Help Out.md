When you **help another hunter** with a move they are making, roll +[[Cool]].

- On a 10+ your help grants them +1 to their roll.
- On a 7-9 your help grants them +1 to their roll, but you also expose yourself to trouble or danger.
- On a miss, you expose yourself to trouble or danger without helping.

Note that help bonuses do not stack: if two people **help out**, the hunter just gets +1 on their roll.

This is used when a hunter wants to help another hunter make a move. Helping will give the other hunter +1 on a single roll. It’s okay to see what the result is before deciding to help out, as long as it still makes sense that the hunter could do something to help improve the results.

Make sure they tell you what concrete action they are taking to help out. If they can’t think of how they help, then they don’t get to do it. You should also make sure their actions actually do help in the game, too. For example, helping with an attack might allow the helper to add their weapon’s [[harm]] to the injury the first hunter inflicts on the monster.

A result of 7-9 means that the hunter succeeds in helping, but exposes themselves to trouble. A lot of the time this trouble will be obvious, as when they are helping someone **[[Kick Some Ass]]**. Here you could inflict [[harm]] on both of [[the hunters]]. In other cases the trouble will be less obvious, such as a when trying to help **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** by interviewing witnesses: this might lead to hostile rumours circulating about the hunter later on, or make an enemy of a witness.

On a miss, the help does no good and the helper exposes themselves to trouble or danger. This could be the same as the danger of the move being helped, or something else entirely.
