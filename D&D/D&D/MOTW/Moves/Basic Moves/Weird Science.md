- On a *10+*, you pick two requirements.
- On a *7-9*, you pick one requirement and [[the Keeper]] picks a second one.
- On a *6-*, something goes horribly wrong. You are still able to create your device, but [[the Keeper]] picks three requirements. **[[Weird]] science requirements:**
	-   It needs a rare and/or [[Weird]] material.
	-   It won’t be very reliable.
	-   It requires huge amounts of power or fuel.
	-   It will take a long time to get it working.
	-   It won’t work exactly as you intended.
	-   You’ll need help (beyond [[the hunters]] on your team) to finish it.

**Advanced [[Weird]] Science .** When you advance your [[Weird]] science move, add this:
