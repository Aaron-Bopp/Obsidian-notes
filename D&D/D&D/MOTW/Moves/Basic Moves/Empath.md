## Empath

When you **open up your brain to feel the emotions of something right there in front of you**, roll +[[Weird]]:

- On a *10+*, you gain a clear impression of their current emotional state and intentions. Take +1 [[forward]] when acting on this knowledge.
- On a *7-9*, you gain a hazy impression of their current emotional state and intentions.
- On a *6-*, your brain is overwhelmed with emotion.

**Advanced Empath .** When you advance your **empath** move, add this:
- On a *12+*, you get an impression (as for *10+*), and you may ask one follow-up question that [[the Keeper]] will answer honestly.

You can use **empath** on anything with emotions (e.g. animals and some [[monsters]]), but the less human they are, the less itâ€™s safe for you. If the emotions are especially strong or alien, you might need to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** regardless of how successful your roll was.
