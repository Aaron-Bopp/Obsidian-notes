### How it works

For a normal person:

- If you get 10+, then they’ll do it for the reason you gave them. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you the minimum it would take for them to do it (or if there’s no way they’d do it).
- On a 7-9, they’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.
- On a miss, your approach is completely wrong: you offend or anger the target.

For another hunter:

- On a 10+, if they do what you ask they mark experience and get +1 [[forward]].
- On a 7-9, they mark experience if they do what you ask.
- On a miss, it’s up to that hunter to decide how badly you offend or annoy them. They mark experience if they decide *not* to do what you asked.

Here’s the most important thing to remember about the **manipulate someone** move: the hunter needs to offer something that makes the target willing to do what the hunter asks.

Once you have given them a reason, **tell them what you want them to do** and roll +[[Charm]].

This move is used when you want someone to do something for you and they don’t want to do it. To get them to do what you’re asking you’ll need a good reason. What counts as a good reason depends on what you are asking for and your relationship with them.

For friends and allies, you might just need to ask. For witnesses to a monster attack, you could tell them you are with the police, or just offer them some cash for answering your questions.

### When is it used?

This doesn’t mean it should be hard. It can be enough for a hunter to pretend to be a police officer, or say “I’ll look after you,” or promise to [[Help Out]] later.

But don’t let it be too easy either. If a hunter is asking a bystander to be bait in a monster trap, there may be nothing the hunter can offer that will convince them to do it. Use the target’s motivation to help determine what might be enough for them. Use your agenda of making the world seem real and the rule to [[always say]] what honesty demands to assess whether the target would be willing to do what the hunter is asking for.

When a hunter tries to manipulate another hunter, things work differently. In this case, the incentive is the experience check and bonus that will be available to the target if the move succeeds. The target hunter gets to choose whether that incentive, along with [[whatever]] they were offered in the game, is enough to convince them do what is asked.

**Manipulate someone** does not normally work on [[monsters]] unless you have [[The Monstrous]] move [[Dark Negotiator]] see [[MANIPULATING MONSTERS]]

### When it succeeds

If the hunter promises something as part of manipulating someone, but then fails to do what they promised, you can use that in the game. If they ever meet that person again, this failure is not going to be forgotten! That means that you can set a new mystery in the same place, and [[the hunters]] will need to deal with [[bystanders]] who have no reason to trust them, or who may even want revenge.

### When it fails

Misses on this move naturally lead to offending the target, or the hunter coming across as obtuse or annoying. When the move is used on the other hunters, one of these results will probably happen naturally. For misses with [[bystanders]], the target could see through a disguise, or refuse to believe a critical lie (or truth!). Look at the threat type for the character (or pick one for them right now) and their motivation will give you an idea how they are going to react.
