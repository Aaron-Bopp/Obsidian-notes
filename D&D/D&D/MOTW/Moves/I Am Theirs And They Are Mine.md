 Whenever you are in danger, your Guide knows it. If your Guide is suffering [[harm]] (and itâ€™s feasible), you can spend a point of [[Luck]] to redirect the attack onto yourself as if you have rolled 10+ with **[[Protect Someone]]**. If you are suffering [[harm]], you can decide that your Guide has protected you and is suffering this [[harm]] instead. If you choose this, roll for **bond abuse**.
