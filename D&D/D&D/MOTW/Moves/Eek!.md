 When a monster (or anyone really) appears on the scene and you find a hiding spot, roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+, you hide in the best nearby spot before the monster sees you. On a 7-9, pick one of these: 
- You hide okay, but the monster is now between you and escape. 

- You hide okay for now, but your hiding spot is bound to be spotted soon. 

- You hide okay, but leave something important out in the open.
