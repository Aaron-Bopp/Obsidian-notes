base class: [[The Summoned]]

 You’re [[weird]], and people react badly. You can’t use [[manipulate someone]] until you prove yourself to them first (this includes the other hunters it’s up to them when you have proved yourself ). Until then, they’ll just try to get away from you. You can spend 1 [[Luck]] to have the person take to you. Skip the roll: they act as if you rolled a 12. Additionally, you can use [[manipulate someone]] on [[monsters]] that can reason and talk (but they always want something really bad).
