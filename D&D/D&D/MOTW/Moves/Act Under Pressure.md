This covers trying to do something under conditions of particular stress or danger. [[Examples]] of acting under pressure are: staying on task while a banshee screams at you; barricading a door before the giant rats catch up; resisting the mental domination of a brain-worm; fighting on when you’re badly injured.

When you **act under pressure**, roll [[+Cool]].

- On a 10+ you do what you set out to.
- On a 7-9 [[the Keeper]] is going to give you a worse outcome, hard choice, or price to pay.
- On a miss, things go to hell.

This is a general purpose move, for any time a hunter tries something that is dangerous or liable to fail, and isn’t covered by any other [[moves]] (either a basic move, or one from a playbook).

The pressure can be anything from being detected when they’re hiding to resisting death as they try and escape a blazing building.

Make sure you establish what the pressure is at the start, so [[the hunters]] know what they’re in for if they mess up. You need to know what they’re trying to do, and to let them know what’s making it hard.

A result of 7-9 tells you to give them a worse outcome, hard choice, or price to pay—they can do what they wanted, if they accept what you pick. It is still a success, so they should be able to do what they wanted, although the cost might be high enough that they decide not to. Use your agenda and principles to help decide.

For our hiding example, maybe they can stay hidden, but only if they let the monster trap them in a dead end. Or they have to go so far back that they can no longer see what’s happening. In both of these cases, the hard choice is about where they’re positioned in the story. They could stay hidden, but have to pay the price.

For the burning building, maybe they can escape if they jump out a second floor window. Or they can run through flames to escape or stay somewhere that is safe for now. In these cases, the price is some [[harm]] from the fall or the fire.

On a miss, then whatever the pressure has overwhelmed the hunter.
