## No Limits

When you **push your physical body past its limits**, roll [[+Weird]]:

- On a *10+*, your body obeys your will, to the limits of physical possibility (see below), for a moment.
- On a *7-9*, you do it but choose one consequence: suffer 1-[[harm]], take –1 [[forward]], or you need to rest right now.
- On a *6-*, something goes horribly wrong.
**Advanced No Limits .** If you advance your **no limits** move, add this:
- On a *12+*, you can continue acting at your body’s limits for 30 seconds.

For the purposes of this move, “physical possibility” means “conceivably possible for a human.” For example:

- **Physically Possible:** Lift an SUV, Jump over a truck, Punch through a wall.
- **Not Physically Possible:** Lift a building, Fly, Punch a blast of energy at a foe. [[Past Lives]]
