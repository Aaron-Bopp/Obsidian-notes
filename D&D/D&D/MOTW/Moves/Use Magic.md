### How it works
When you **use magic**, say what you’re trying to achieve and how you do the spell, then roll [[+Weird]].

- If you get a 10+, the magic works without issues: choose your effect.
- On a 7-9, it works imperfectly: choose your effect and a glitch. [[The Keeper]] will decide what effect the glitch has.
- On a miss, you lose control of the magic. This never ends well.

By default the magic has one of the effects listed below, lasts for around thirty minutes, and does not expose you to danger, unwanted attention, or side-effects. If there’s a glitch that might change.

Effects:

- Inflict [[harm]] (1-[[harm]] ignore-[[armour]] magic obvious).
- Enchant a weapon. It gets +1 [[harm]] and +magic.
- Do one thing that is beyond human limitations.
- Bar a place or portal to a specific person or a type of creature.
- Trap a specific person, minion, or monster.
- Banish a spirit or curse from the person, object, or place it inhabits.
- Summon a monster into the world.
- Communicate with something that you do not share a language with.
- Observe another place or time.
- Heal 1-[[harm]] from an injury, or cure a disease, or neutralize a poison.

Glitches:

- The effect is weakened.
- The effect is of short duration.
- You take 1-[[harm]] ignore-[[armour]].
- The magic draws immediate, unwelcome attention.
- It has a problematic side effect.

[[The Keeper]] may require one or more of the following:

- The spell requires weird materials.
- The spell will take 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute to cast.
- The spell requires ritual chanting and gestures.
- The spell requires you to draw arcane symbols.
- You need one or two people to help cast the spell.
- You need to refer to a tome of magic for the details.

Magic, by its nature, breaks the rules.  If you want to do magic that goes beyond these effects, it counts as **[[big magic]]**. [[Big magic]] uses different rules, described below.

When a hunter **uses magic**, it’s important to ask them what they’re trying to do (and work out which of the effects they are trying for). Ask the hunter how they cast the spell, and what it looks like too.

Then consider the scope of what they’re doing, how they said the spell is cast, and decide if you will require anything extra from the list.

Pick extra requirements based on the size of magical effect. Magic that has a big effect should need a bigger effort. Usually pick one or two things including anything the hunter included in their description of casting the spell. You can offer alternatives, too, so that the hunter *either* takes one minute *or* needs arcane symbols, say.

Partial successes when **using magic** mean that the hunter has to pick a glitch. Glitches are bad news, but it’s up to the hunter to decide which one happens. Magic should always be dangerous and unpredictable, so hammer that home when you decide how the glitches take effect.

On a miss **using magic**, make as hard a move as you like: anything can happen when magic goes wrong. Reversing the intended effect of the spell is an option, so that the exact opposite of what the hunter wanted happens. You can also go for off-the-wall weirdness: portals to other dimensions; angry spirits converging on the hunter; or changes to the laws of physics around the hunter—that sort of thing.

**ONE THING BEYOND HUMAN LIMITATIONS**

This particular effect is an important one because what you allow here will define how powerful magic is in your game.

For a gritty game, going ‘beyond human limitations’ might include:

- lifting a car just enough to free someone trapped underneath
- carrying on despite a nasty injury
- resisting a mental attack from a monster.

For a more super-heroic game, going ‘beyond human limitations’ might include:

- flying up to a rooftop.
- surviving a deadly injury.
- reading the thoughts of everyone around you.

So, when a hunter wants to exceed human limitations, think carefully about what allowing their desired effect in this case implies for your entire game. You can think of your decisions about this as a dial that determines how much power [[the hunters]] can get from everyday magic spells.

If you think the desired effect is too powerful, tell them they would have to do it with by using a **[[big magic]]** ritual instead).
