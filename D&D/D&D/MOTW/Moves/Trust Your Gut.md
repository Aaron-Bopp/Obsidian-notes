## Trust Your Gut

When you **consult your instincts about what to do next**, roll [[+Weird]]: 
- On a *10+*, [[the Keeper]] will tell where you should go. Wherever that is, it will be important. You get +1 [[ongoing]] on the way to this place. 
- On a *7-9*, [[the Keeper]] will tell you a general direction to go. Take +1 [[forward]] as you explore that. 
- On a *6-*, your instincts lead you into danger. 

**Advanced Trust Your Gut .** If you advance your **trust your gut** move, add this: 
- On a *12+*, in addition to the usual 10+ result, [[the Keeper]] will tell you about one important thing you should investigate further.

Your gut feelings will point you somewhere important, but they do not care about your conscious concerns. To your gut, the current mystery is just one important thing amongst many.
