 At the beginning of each mystery, roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ [[hold]] 2 and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 
1. Spend your [[hold]] during the mystery to have someone you meet know of you in a positive light (maybe they read your blog, listen to your podcast, or watch your Internet/TV show, etc). You may end up getting asked for autographs or given “hot” leads, etc.
