Investigating can be done any number of ways: following tracks, interviewing witnesses, forensic analysis, looking up old folklore in a library, typing the monster’s name into Google, capturing the monster and conducting tests on it, and so on. Anything that might give you more information about what’s going on is fair game for an investigate move.

When you **investigate a mystery**, roll +Sharp.

- On a 10+ [[hold]] 2, and on a 7-9 [[hold]] 1.

One [[hold]] can be spent to ask [[the Keeper]] one of the following questions:

- *What happened here?*
- *What sort of creature is it?*
- *What can it do?*
- *What can hurt it?*
- *Where did it go?*
- *What was it going to do?*
- *What is being concealed here?*

On a miss, you reveal some information to the monster or whoever you are talking to. [[The Keeper]] might ask you some questions, which you have to answer.

It’s important that your attempts to investigate (and the results you get from them) are plausible and consistent with what’s happening. For example, if you’re using laboratory equipment to investigate evidence, you probably won’t be able to learn anything about the monster’s magical origins. [[The Keeper]] is obliged to answer truthfully, but not necessarily in full—just what you can work out in your current situation and using your current methods. [[The Keeper]] may choose to describe how something you’ve just discovered relates to something you learned previously.

[[The Keeper]] may ask, “How do you find that out?” If you don’t have a good answer, choose another question instead.

The **investigate a mystery** move will be used frequently. When [[the hunters]] begin each new mystery, they will have (at best) a vague idea of what they’re hunting. Investigation is the main way to find out what’s going on, where the monster is, who they need to protect, and anything else they need to know.

The move covers any investigation technique [[the hunters]] can think of: interviewing witnesses, sending monster DNA to the lab, tracking it through the alleys, looking at a dead body and reconstructing what happened, looking through ancient tomes of monster lore, and hacking into police databases. These are all legitimate ways to investigate.

Ask yourself, “Could they conceivably find anything useful that way?” If the answer is “Yes,” tell them to go ahead. If the answer is “No” then ask, “How would you find that out?” If they have a good reply, let them know the answer. If there still isn’t a way to find out, you can ask them to pick a different question instead.

It’s important that you give [[the hunters]] as many clues as you can. It’s easy to make [[the hunters]] work hard to discover the details of the mystery. But that isn’t part of your agenda. Every success on an **investigate** move should give [[the hunters]] something solid. You should also be generous with obvious details, even on a miss. We play to find out what [[the hunters]] do once they’ve uncovered the mysteries, not how they do it. The **investigate** move is a way for you give them the information they need to decide.

For example, if a hunter is **investigating** by looking at the body of a monster victim, you should describe the state of the body first. “It’s been ripped apart, looks like it went for the heart. The heart is missing.” Those details don’t require a move, because they’re obvious and don’t address the **investigate** questions directly. If the hunter then gets a success on the roll, they may ask you to tell them about the creature’s powers—that’s something that requires careful analysis of the scene and injuries.

Sometimes the answer to one of the questions will be a negative, such as when you are asked for more about the creature’s weaknesses when [[the hunters]] have already discovered them all. In these cases, make it clear that they know this. “Your hours poring over the books tell you that the creature has no more weaknesses.”

Misses for this move lend themselves to trouble with normal people (e.g. annoying the witness; being caught stealing evidence, etc) or giving away information to their enemies (e.g. the monster or [[minions]] hear about questions being asked; [[the hunters]] are observed in their evidence collection; etc).

**AN EXAMPLE INVESTIGATION**

Here’s an example showing how an investigation scene might play out.

Our cast is:

- Mary, playing Mark (a Wronged hunter).
- Chris, playing Cray (a Spooky hunter).
- Alan, [[the Keeper]] (who is also playing Officer Hannah Tarlton, a bystander, whose motivation is to join the hunt).

The investigation:

*Hannah has brought [[the hunters]] to the place she saw an attack take place. [[The hunters]] are posing as FBI agents.*

**Alan** (speaking as Hannah): *“Right, here’s where it happened,” says Hannah, “You can see the blood on the wall there. Our witness said the attacker ran off down that alley and over a fence.”*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“You mind if I take some samples?” Then I just start, without waiting for permission.*

**Alan** (speaking as Hannah): *“Uh, sure. Forensics are already taking a look at it.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“So, what did the witness have to say about the attacker? I’m interested in anything, even if it’s kinda weird.”*

**Alan:** *Okay, roll* ***investigate a mystery*** *for me.*

*Mary rolls the dice and adds Mark’s Sharp.*

**Mary:** *I got a nine. One question?*

**Alan:** *Well, you already asked about the witness seeing anything weird, so I figure you’re interested in its powers?*

**Mary:** *Definitely.*

**Alan:** *Okay, Hannah says “Well, the guy claimed that the attacker just vaulted over that fence down there. But he’d been drinking.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“Right. Witnesses, huh?”*

**Chris:** *While they are chatting I want to test the bloodstains to work out what it is.*

**Alan:** *Um, how do you test a bloodstain for what kind of monster attacked?*

**Chris:** *I’m going to get out my chemistry test kit and try the samples with, like, silver to see if there’s a reaction that you might see from werewolf blood, or if there’s sulphur present that might mean it was a demon, or if it reacts to holy water, that could be a vampire or demon blood. That sort of thing.*

**Alan:** *I guess that might work. But only for things you could learn from the bloodstains—and it seems to be mainly human blood, maybe all human. Roll it.*

*Chris rolls the dice and adds Cray’s Sharp.*

**Chris:** *Yeah, a twelve. First question: what is it?*

**Alan:** *Okay, you find a couple of splashes of blood that are a slightly different colour—more richly red, and slower drying. They react to the holy water test, and let’s say you had garlic in there too. The blood starts smoldering in contact with both. So a vampire, most likely.*

**Chris:** *Vampire. Got it. In that case, next question is “what can it do?”*

**Alan:** *How are you going to find that out from bloodstains?*

**Chris:** *Remember how I spent all that time researching vampires for the case last month? I know that turned out to be a chupacabra, but I still read all those books.*

**Alan:** *Okay, so we flash back to you going over all those old books, and you’re making a list of vampire powers on a pad: super strength, fast, mesmerism, rapid [[healing]] are the things you wrote on the list. Hannah says “So, you finished your tests and everything? I have a job to do here.”*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“Yes, that’s everything for now. Thanks for your help.”*

**Alan:** *Cool, she gets back to her own work. What do you do now?*
