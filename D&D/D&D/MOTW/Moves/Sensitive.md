## Sensitive

When you **open up your brain to the psychic environment**, roll [[+Weird]]: 
- On a *10+*, you gain a definite impression (a vision, tangible aura, overheard thought, etc) about something important. 
- On a *7-9*, you gain a hazy impression about something important. 
- On a *6-*, your brain makes contact with something dangerous. **Advanced Sensitive .** When you advance your **sensitive** move, add this: 
- On a *12+*, you get an impression as for *10+*, plus you may ask one follow-up question that [[the Keeper]] will answer honestly.

Although you will find out something important, it wonâ€™t necessarily relate to your current concerns or the mystery you are investigating right now.
