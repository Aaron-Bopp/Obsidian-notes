# Phenomena Mysteries

*By Michael Sands*

Phenomena mysteries give hunters the chance to investigate an increasingly dangerous source of weirdness rather than a monster.

To create a mystery centered on a phenomenon, [[the Keeper]] will need the following details:

-   A [[basic concept]] (like a standard mystery) describing what is going on.

-   A phenomenon type and motivation.

-   What effects the phenomenon has on hunters (and other [[bystanders]]) who get too close.

-   What its weakness is (this works differently to monster weaknesses).

-   [[Custom moves]] for its effects (optional but recommended).

## Phenomenon Types

These are the possible phenomenon types:

-   Alien (motivation: to be unfathomable)

-   Artifact (motivation: to grant someone more power than they can handle)

-   Biohazard (motivation: to infect, [[harm]], and spread)

-   Bubble (motivation: to keep inside things inside, and outside things outside)

-   Conspiracy (motivation: to gather power, keep secrets, and create confusion)

-   Corruption (motivation: to change the laws of the universe)

-   Experiment (motivation: to unleash dangers)

-   Mutagen (motivation: to transform creatures and people)

-   Panic (motivation: to make people act irrationally)

-   Portal (motivation: to draw things from one world to another)

-   Teratogen (motivation: to turn creatures and people into [[monsters]])

-   Zone (motivation: to [[harm]] all that venture within)

Every phenomenon should have at least one custom move to describe what it does. Create [[custom moves]] for a phenomenon the same way you would for a monster, based on your concept and its abilities.

**For a phenomenon, weaknesses are not what allows it be defeated or killed . Weaknesses are the secrets or discoveries that will allow [[the hunters]] to mitigate, undo, or prevent what the phenomenon wants to do .** In general, create one weakness that allows [[the hunters]] to stop the phenomenon (or to stop its bad effects). If applicable, create another weakness that allows them to cure those who were affected. 

**For example:** *The phenomenon is a time loop (type: Bubble) that has a town stuck repeating one afternoon, and prevents anyone from leaving. It is caused by strange crystals that were discovered in a nearby mine. The phenomenon’s weakness is that it must be able to radiate energy to create the time loop effect—if the crystals are contained (by returning them to the mine, placing them in a special containment device, or something similar) then the effect will stop.*

You should create a countdown for the mystery as normal. However, rather than thinking about a monster’s plan and how it will get worse, you should think about how the phenomenon will become more and more dangerous as it grows without constraint.

As with standard mystery design, you should create other threats. There will be [[bystanders]] and places as usual, and often [[minions]] (including people taking advantage of, or believing they control, the phenomenon). The phenomenon could even involve or create [[monsters]]—these would need to be defeated in the usual ways.

## Phenomena Threat Moves

These are the [[threat moves]] a phenomenon can use during the mystery:

-   Hint at its effects.

-   Show its effects directly and undeniably.

-   Break the world’s laws.

-   Increase or decrease in size or intensity.

-   Create some new weirdness.

-   [[Harm]] or destroy someone or something.

-   React unexpectedly.

-   Escape from containment.

-   [[Hold]] something in place.

-   Grant an unnatural ability.

-   Hinder movement.

-   Subvert a bystander’s motivation.

Because phenomena are more varied in their motivations and powers than [[monsters]], you should rely more on [[custom moves]]. Note down a few specific things the phenomenon might do (these might overlap with the general phenomenon [[moves]]).

**For example:** *The time loop example above might have these [[custom moves]]:*

-   *If you try to leave the time loop area, you find yourself back in town with a short block of missing time.*

-   *The crystals cause a weird subsonic buzzing feeling when you are near them.*

-   *At 8:23pm, the time resets to 12:16pm of the same day.*

-   *Only those who entered the town after the crystals began looping time can perceive the multiple loops. Those who were there at the start just live the same afternoon over and over without noticing or remembering previous loops.*

## Investigating Weird Phenomena

In order to make the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** move a bit less creature-specific, hunters dealing with phenomena may ask the following as part of the standard list of questions:

-   How is this phenomenon doing this?

-   What could fix it, cure it, or slow it down?

-   How far does the effect reach?

-   What will be affected next?
