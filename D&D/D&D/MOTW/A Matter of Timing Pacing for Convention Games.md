# A Matter of Timing Pacing for Convention Games
*By Bryanna Hitchcock*

[[Many]] Keepers struggle to end their convention games on time without rushing through their final confrontation. Delivering a rousing finish without going over your scheduled time is an art and a science. In this article we’re talking about the science. Spoiler alert: a little planning goes a long way.

Pacing in RPGs can mean the ebb and flow of action in the story, but it also refers to the way a session evolves and how it treats the essential beats of a story. It’s no mystery that stories need a beginning, a middle, and an end. In campaign play, this ebb and flow happens naturally as the narrative and group develop. But for a one-shot, like a convention game, [[the Keeper]] is in a pressure cooker to deliver a fun time and a complete story on a tight timeline.

There’s plenty of narrative advice out there about plot points, rising action, and the like. This article provides practical advice for Keepers to end a convention game on time without sacrificing an exciting finale.

What's the Point?

Nobody has unlimited time to prepare for convention games. I’m no different, which is precisely why I spend the time planning—not just the details of the game, but how I will run it. It may sound tedious, but spending just a few minutes making a list or two can really improve your pacing. The two lists I recommend are an Agenda and a Timeline.

The purpose of planning is to be respectful of everyone’s time, including your own. When creating an Agenda and Timeline, the goals are:

-   Make sure you run the kind of game you want to run.

-   Give your players a complete story.

-   Give yourself time and tools to adjust the pace as you play.

-   Give yourself time for a dramatic conclusion to your game.

-   Clean your room for the next group who have to use it and leave on time.

It’s easy to focus on the visual space of the game table. [[Many]] Keepers who are masters of visual aids and table presentation still struggle to control the temporal landscape: the time you have to play as a group. The tools I use for this are my Agenda for the game and the Timeline for my game slot at the convention. Let’s look at the Agenda first.

# Agenda: Goals & Expectations

The Agenda is a way to ensure you set expectations for yourself and the players.

Even if you have a mystery already chosen for the game, a session is about much more than the adventure. How long is the game? Always check to see if anyone has to leave early. Is there a food deadline or convention event people want to break for? What are your table rules?

The Agenda is your opportunity to remind yourself and to inform the players about breaks, table rules, safety mechanics, and any other details that will ensure you have the kind of experience you want for yourself and your players. This also gives players who perhaps aren’t hungry for the dish you’re serving a chance to opt out.

Make a list of all the things you want to tell people up front. Revise this list as you plan your game.

## Example Agenda

-   A list of the [[gear]] I need to run the game.

-   FYIs (for the beginning—to ensure everyone is a good fit for the game):

-   Game runs until 10pm, hard stop.

-   “There will be breaks after character creation and once more toward the end. Does anyone have to leave sooner?”

-   Trans Acceptance. Respect people’s pronouns (mine are she/her). Anyone who has a problem with that should take their leave.

-   No ball hogs. My personal pet peeve is a player who craves the spotlight at the expense of other players. I let my players know I may cut them off, but I also reward play that shares the spotlight.

-   Content Warnings: Dark Humor, Profanity, Romance.

-   Safety Off, but mind your aim—I don’t use X-Cards or explicit Lines/Veils when I run MotW. However, everyone should be kind to their fellow players and respectful of any concerns raised.

-   Cinematic style: Scenes framed like a movie.

-   Get to the heart of every scene quickly—warn that I will either push them when a scene is lagging or cut away at dramatic moments.

-   About MotW & Player Experience: Find out who’s never played a Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) game and ask those who have to assist.

-   Explain the dice mechanic, ratings, and point out the basic [[moves]].

-   Choose playbooks.

-   Read your playbook’s [[History]] options first, to guide your character vision.

-   Questions on character creation or choices?

-   Your hunters are already a team; you have each other on speed dial; no [[introductions]] are necessary once play starts.

-   Explain [[Luck]].

-   Review Basic [[Moves]] with extra attention to:

-   **[[Help Out]]** and **protect**: Usable after the roll. You’re a kick ass team!

-   Explain **[[Use Magic]]** and invite players to get cinematic.

-   **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**: Answers will start out general but get more specific as you get closer to the creature. You can’t exactly identify a monster just from a news article about a murder. Crime scene evidence is better, especially if you can get to the scene.

-   Table Rules:

-   Cell phones: *Fine:* getting a text from family or convention roommates, briefly looking up something on the internet that will help the game be more awesome, checking the time, calls from work. *Unacceptable:* playing a video game, having a long conversation, continuous texting, etc.

-   One point of [[Luck]] for convention games.

-   Fan Mail: I provide a bowl with 1 chip per player. They can give these to each other as a reward for awesome play. 1 chip provides a +1 on any roll. Once used, chips go back in the bowl.

The context of your game is important. Conventions in different regions have varying expectations regarding game length. In my [[area]], convention slots can run up to 12 hours! For me, 6 hours is the sweet spot for a *Monster of the Week* game. However, in [[many]] areas 4-hour slots are the norm. Also: for online games in the evening, 4 hours has been a solid length for me.

![[image54.jpg]]In this article, we’ll focus on the biggest challenge: the 4-hour con or online game with 3-4 players. For blocks of play in the timeline, I use 5 minutes per PC as a rule of thumb to ensure I have enough time in each block for each hunter to have a significant scene.

No matter how much or little time you have, it’s always important to give yourself opportunity to evaluate the pacing and possibilities of your game. You don’t need to adhere to your break schedule exactly, but make sure you take them.

0:55

-   House rules.

-   Tell players to imagine a brief action shot of their character during the break.

1:00 • Break & Keeper prep.

![[image56.jpg]] 1:15 • Start the Show—Cinematic Framing.

-   I like to signal the move into actual play and story time with dramatic music. Each player takes a turn describing an out of context action shot of their character meant to show ‘the audience’ something important about who they are. This is a great chance to establish signature [[weapons]], stylish lairs, and memorable moments from [[history]].

# Convention Gaming Technique

Unlike some tools for Keepers, once you’ve created your first Agenda and Timeline, they can be recycled and modified for future games. No matter which system or setting you run, you can provide a consistent quality of experience for your tables.

Even if you’re generally not a person who makes lists or wants to carefully manage game time, taking a few moments to sketch out your goals can help you prepare for a more off-the-cuff game.

# What about “Play to find out?”

One of the best aspects of PbtA games is the idea of “play to find out.” Even if [[the Keeper]] knows [[the threats]], they should never plan out the course of the game in advance. We don’t have to violate this principle in order to run a tight game. Every decision you make can move the story [[forward]]. Timeline notes like ‘Rising Action’ or ‘The Big Break’ are guides for scene framing.

Once the team has assembled, let the players take their time with their investigation and banter. Make them work a bit more, with **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** results that lead them to new threats rather than providing straightforward answers. Later, when the finale approaches, your choices can drive [[the hunters]] more directly to the finish; don’t [[hold]] anything back.

# Other Applications

While the [[examples]] provided here are tailored for *Monster of the Week*, the concepts can be applied to [[other games]]. I started making timelines for my organized play of *Dungeons & Dragons* games. In the tight time frames provided, I found myself struggling to make time for the setpiece [[fights]] at the end of the scenario. There’s only so much you can do to speed up play in games with figures and tactical maps. I found it took about 75 minutes to do a big set-piece a battle justice. By planning around that, and taking some notes about how long an average turn takes, I could adjust the rest of the scenario accordingly.

When we’re rushed by the time constraints of a convention game, we risk a mediocre finale or asking players to somehow finish the game in another location. With a little planning, you can focus play time on your priorities and take command of the temporal game space.

# Nail the Landing

Few things were more frustrating to me as a GM than when I couldn’t finish a game strong because I ran out of time. [[Many]] great GMs I‘ve met have amazing setups and visual presentations, but struggle to make their endings live up to their hopes. Like them, I want players to leave my games remembering it as a fun movie where they played a starring role. An explosive finish is an essential part of that experience.

Like my games, I’ll wrap this up with a bit of cinematic framing.

The screen goes dark, the rock music starts, and the credits roll.

Thank you for reading.
