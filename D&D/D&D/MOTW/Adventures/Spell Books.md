*A little magic can take you a long way.*

—Roald Dahl, *James and the Giant Peach*

*There is magic, but you have to be the magician. You have to make the magic happen.*

—Sidney Sheldon, *Are You Afraid of the Dark?*

![[image66.png]]Magic in *Monster of the Week* can generate concern around the question of ‘everyday magic.’ Since the game is squarely based on classic monster hunting television shows like *Buffy* and *Supernatural*, players quickly understand that ritual magic allows for special events or adventures, like Buffy’s [[resurrection]] or Sam and Dean Winchester traveling back in time.

The new weirdness rules can help in games based on low magic or purely science fiction monster hunting shows like *The X-Files* or *Fringe*. That still leaves a question about running the vanilla magic rules in a game inspired by urban fantasy where magic is rare. One way the group can make magic more formalised is to limit it to a smaller number of defined spells. New spells must be found, researched, or invented rather than simply improvised in play (as with the normal **[[Use Magic]]** move).

# Spell Formulae

Every aspiring magic-using character should create a few starting spells they have learned before the game begins.

Spells should be written up with the exact effects of success and failure.

Apply the **[[Use Magic]]** rules as a starting point, picking specific effects, glitches, and requirements to fit the spell. If the effects are more powerful, the spell should have more potential glitches and requirements to balance that out.

You may add new requirements and glitches if you want, using the existing ones as guidelines.

For example, Gerard [[The Spooky]] wants a spell that turns him momentarily insubstantial to protect him from monster attacks. This is clearly ‘beyond human limitations’ and similar to a ‘heal’ effect, which makes it a bit more powerful than a regular spell. Gerard’s player and [[the Keeper]] agree that the spell needs a rare ingredient—a special mystic herb that Gerard must swallow—and certain arcane gestures. In the case of a glitch, it will have reduced effect (only half the [[harm]] is avoided) and attract unwanted attention (from other things that live in the insubstantial dimension Gerard is visiting). To cast this spell, roll the **[[Use Magic]]** move as usual, but the effect, requirements, and glitches are always the pre-agreed ones that go with the spell formula.

# Spell Books

Hunters with magical backgrounds should begin with a spell book containing a core group of spells. These should be developed between player and Keeper. The payoff for the magician should be that the downside is clearly limited if it misfires. Various forms of investigative, illusion, protection, and [[healing]] magic spells are to be encouraged. Fantasy tabletop RPGs like *Dungeon World* are a good source of [[inspiration]], with the understanding that the spells generally need to be powered down a bit to match an urban fantasy setting.

Spellcasters may be allowed to research spells—but this should often come with the same sort of serious costs associated with **[[big magic]]**. In many cases, the exact same requirements as **[[big magic]]** will work for spell research. A spell book or grimoire is a good special rare ingredient for spell research.

## Christian Book of the Dead (Abridged)

**Example Playbook**

Here is an example grimoire from one of my own adventures:

An exceedingly rare and powerful arcane grimoire, the *Christian*

*Book of the Dead* is a collection of translated medieval magical rituals centered on the ‘heretical’ practice of Christian necromancy by a strange medieval Gnostic sect based in southern England. They worshipped the ‘Black Death’ and were brutally eliminated by the Inquisition. The original text is in the Church Latin of the late 13th century by a William of Baskerville but an abridged modern translation was produced in the 1920s by the writer Professor M.R. James for Red Dragon Press.

![[image67.jpg]]The book describes various magic spells that allow one to conjure spirits of the dead and speak with them. In addition, it contains a spell to reanimate those who died by violence: these individuals become zombies under the control of the necromancer.

All the spells involve sacrificial blood, medieval prayers in Latin, and the use of a complicated magic circle of salt to protect the necromancer if the spell fails. The spells also involve the caster focusing their will and then speaking the ‘true name’ of both the dead person and the Angel of Death.

The book also details the expensive **[[big magic]]** ritual necessary to create a ‘Hand of Glory.’

Famously, the original (but not the abridged) text also includes a complex ritual that allows for the manufacture of a musical instrument called Gabriel’s Horn. When sounded, the Horn can transform four zombies created by the book’s ritual into the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and bring about the end of the world.

## Hand of Glory

A Hand of Glory is the dried and pickled hand of a man who has been hanged. It is usually the left (or ‘sinister’) hand, or the hand that ‘did the deed.’

Old European beliefs attribute great powers to a Hand of Glory that has been combined with a candle made of fat from the corpse of the same hanged man who died on the gallows.

When the fingers of the Hand close around this candle (see above) and the candle is lit, the Hand provides the following move: **When you walk into a building while holding a lit Hand of Glory**, Roll [[+Weird]]:

-   On a 10+, choose two from the list below.

-   On a 7-9, choose one from the list below. **Hand of Glory effects:**

-   Any locked door, gate, portal, safe, etc. that is within the candle light unlocks itself.

-   Any hostile person you encounter will be paralyzed as long as they gaze directly into the candle’s light. A paralyzed hunter may spend a Luck point to escape the effect.

-   The candle flares up blue in the presence of secret doors, buried treasure, etc. and its light reveals any invisible creature or item.

# Example Spells

## Raise Zombie

**When you call up the recently dead by their name to serve you**, you need to wear personal clothing from the grave of a victim of violence, while chanting John 6:63 at their graveside. Roll [[+Weird]]:

-   On any result, the zombie rises at midnight.

-   On a 10+, the zombie you named will arise on that midnight.

-   On a 7-9, the zombie will attack you unless you are protected (a circle of salt is the easiest warding).

-   On a miss, the zombie rises but may not be controlled.

## Command Zombie

**When you seek to control a raised zombie**, call the secret name of the Angel of Death, and roll [[+Weird]].

-   On a 10+, the zombie will obey you until the next full moon.

-   On a 7-9, the zombie will attack you unless you are protected (a circle of salt is the easiest warding).

-   On a miss, the zombie cannot be controlled and will likely stumble around causing violent mayhem.

## Speak with the Dead

**When you call the spectre of the recently dead**, a personal item of the deceased must be thrown into a fire, and you must then call them by name. Roll [[+Weird]]:

-   On a 10+, the spirit you named comes and answers your questions honestly.

-   On a 7-9, the spirit you named comes and tells you some obscure things or speaks in riddles.

-   On a miss, a spectre claiming to be that spirit answers your questions—but some answers are lies.

# Grimoires In Your Game

It is easy to imagine one or more of these texts being the basis of a whole campaign. The *Twenty Palaces* novels by Harry Connolly offer a good model: The Society is a ruthless guild of sorcerers who track down grimoires and destroy them, their users, and the [[monsters]] they create.

In my case, I recreated the satanic Pallas Society from Val Lewton’s classic film *The Seventh Victim* to trouble the characters with the *Christian Book of the Dead*.

## Society of Pallas (or Palladists)

The Palladists are a secret theistic Satanist society. The name is a cover: it comes from Pallas Athena, and is intended to bring to mind ‘wisdom and learning’. The Palladists use the owl as their symbol.

The members believe that reason naturally leads to a bizarre pacifism

(“direct violence equates to stupidity”) and a worship of ‘evil’ (predatory Social Darwinism favoring Satanist aristocratic elites). They take strict vows committing themselves to these principles—and to the society—for life. Transgression of the group’s rules is punished by death.

The group can program serial killers using Cold War techniques on chosen (i.e. less useful) cult members. The society membership strongly favors old and powerful WASP Eastern elite families (think the Skull and Bones club). The cult would dearly like some actual supernatural knowledge but is currently just a bunch of depraved elites who dress up in funny hats and robes and attend seasonal orgies, as in Kubrick’s film *Eyes Wide Shut*.

The Palladists are based on a fictional Satanist group that was a famous 19th Century hoax. The Palladists also play a major role in the latter part of Umberto Eco’s novel *The Prague Cemetery*. An entire campaign can be centered on [[the hunters]] in conflict with a group like this.

# Other Ways To Use Spellbooks

Of course many other types of campaigns can be imagined about various types of spell books.

[[The hunters]] could inhabit Kenneth Hite’s *Bookhounds of London* setting, obtaining forbidden Lovecraftian tomes from depraved aristocrats and corrupt cultists in 1930s Britain.

Alternatively, the players could explore mysterious powers and dangerous urban spells from Fritz Leiber’s *Our Lady of Darkness* after they gain a copy of the mad scholar Thibaut de Castries’ obscure book *Megapolisomancy: a New Science of Cities*.

Or join Ash back in a medieval Britain that looks surprisingly like the

Southern Californian desert to fight zombies by mispronouncing a phrase from the *Necronomicon Est*.

[[The hunters]] may be foolish enough seek the location of the very gates of Hell itself in the Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows...

The possibilities are as limitless as the volumes in a library located somewhere in Rod Serling’s *Twilight Zone*. With a little thought and input from your players, your mystical hunters can be the catalyst for countless adventures.

And if all else fails, just have them stumble across a copy of *The King in Yellow* and let the madness and postcards from Lake Hali ensue.

Reading in *Monster of the Week* is fundamental, if you ask me.
