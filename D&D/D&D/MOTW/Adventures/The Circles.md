The Circles

*By Paul McBride*

# Concept

Pavlos is a shapeshifting minotaur who needs to eat human flesh every seven years to preserve his youthful human appearance. This is done ritualistically in his labyrinth: a field of crop circles.

As the mystery begins, he needs one more meal, then he will leave to start over in a new location.

# Teaser

**Hendersonville, Iowa, USA:** Two teenagers are looking down on a crop circle near a solitary farmhouse. They’re there to spot UFOs and eventually they head down into the circle. From a distance we see lights flash deep in the circle, the corn rustles, and then all is still.

# Hook

Some options for [[the hunters]]:

-   The teenagers are reported missing.

-   Paddington Reynolds, conspiracy theorist and UFO expert, is convinced that extraterrestrials created the crop circles and the government is covering it up. He announces on his show that he’s going to the site to investigate and will broadcast live from there.

-   [[The hunters]] may be called in by relatives of the teenagers.

-   [[The hunters]] may know (or know of) Reynolds and follow his investigation. Reynolds would be a good friend or rival for a Flake.

# Notes

This should have the pacing and style of a TV episode. It’s fast-paced and should play out over a single evening timeline. If conversations and investigations are dragging on, cut the scene to offscreen badness or leverage other threats.

# Pavlos, young farmer/ immortal minotaur

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume people. Specifically, his seven-year ritual feast)*

In human form, Pavlos is a boy in his late teens with dark features and a strong build. He is very quiet and wary of strangers. In minotaur form, he is 6’6” and 300 lbs of pure rage, with [[fire]] and smoke billowing from his snout. **Powers:**

-   **Transform**: May choose to appear in human or minotaur form.

-   **Alter**: Change the labyrinth (crop circles) at will to confound intruders or to lead them somewhere specific. **Attacks:**

-   **[[Fire]] snort** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[fire]].

-   **Horns** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[forceful]].

-   **Bite** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]].

**[[Armour]]:** None in human form. 2 in minotaur form (thick hide).

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 10. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:**

**The Labyrinth:** If it is destroyed, then he can be killed like any normal human.

**Cannibalism:** If he does not eat his meal of human flesh in time, he will change into a weak and withered old man.

# Nikos, elderly farmer/son and servant of the minotaur

*Minion: [[Guardian]] (motivation: to protect Pavlos and the labyrinth)*

Pavlos is actually Nikos’ father. Nikos can reveal this information dramatically (“Get away from my daddy!”) when he intervenes. **Attacks:** **Shotgun** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[messy]] [[loud]]. **Kick and punch** 0-[[harm]] [[hand]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** None, he’s just a normal human.

# The Crop Circle Labyrinth

*Location: Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

The maze is a series of spiralling circles connected to one larger circle at the center. Hunters and victims will feel disorientated because of the twisting layout and being unable to see over the top of the tall crops.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**[[Let’s Get Out Of Here!]]** When you enter the circle looking for the center, you find it. When you try to find an exit or someone else in the maze, roll +[[Sharp]]:

-   On a 10+, you get there.

-   On a 7-9, you choose: either find the center, or get where you want but something is following you.

-   On a miss, you return to the center.

# The Farmhouse

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

This looks like a regular farmhouse on the outside and the inside. The basement is a shrine with art on the walls depicting the legend and a statue of the minotaur. This is where Pavlos rests after feeding.

# Paddington Reynolds, UFO expert

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

Paddington is determined to prove that he knows the truth and he will put himself in danger to do so. He is sure he knows more than [[the hunters]] and will try to stay a step ahead of them rather than working with them.

He will also try to capture everything he can on film as evidence.

# Wilson Gibbs, Local Sheriff

![[image95.jpg]]*Bystander: Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Gibbs is dismissive of Reynolds and [[the hunters]], who he views as opportunists in a situation he’d prefer to keep quiet. He thinks the crop circle is a hoax arranged by school kids and suspects that Pavlos is somehow involved—but he doesn’t know how. He sees any approaches made by [[the hunters]] to Pavlos and Nikosas as disrupting his own investigation.

# Bill and Sally Daniels, Ed and Jean Cross, parents of the missing kids

*[[Bystanders]]: Helpers (motivation: to join the hunt)*

The parents knew that their kids were going UFO spotting They will head into the crop circle themselves, if necessary, to do their own investigation.
