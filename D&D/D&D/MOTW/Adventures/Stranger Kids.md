Stranger Kids

*By Mark Tygart*

*“When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.”*

—Hunter S. Thompson

The success of the Duffer Brothers’ Netflix series *Stranger Things* has rekindled interest in a sub-genre of monster hunting stories: playing characters who represent, in some way, our childhood selves when we discovered the hobby appeals to some older gamers like me. While a number of kids-focused monster hunting RPGs existed before *Stranger Things*, that program added the potent factor of 1980s nostalgia.

Also some of us are teaching our kids to play, and wonder whether *Monster of the Week* can provide adventures set in a *Stranger Things*-style setting, where kids can battle evil as fictional versions of themselves.

# Back to the Past

“The past,” L. P. Hartley famously said, “is a foreign country,” and this applies to even the relatively recent past. A kid-centred campaign could be set in the present day, but for many the era is a powerful part of the appeal of a kid campaign.

The single biggest change is that this era (the early 1980s) is set before the information revolution. The lack of communications and information technology really contrasts with our current era: no cell phones, few computers, even fewer computer networks, research via books in libraries, etc. Where such technology did exist, it was largely out of reach of the general population: either too expensive or requiring specialist knowledge. This requires no alteration in the game rules beyond changing a few hunter [[gear]] options and modern references in the [[moves]]. Just make sure everything is kept ‘in period’ and you will be fine.

There is an old joke that those who lived through the 60s don’t remember the 60s. This is certainly also true of the 80s, as even those of us old enough to remember the decade often rewrite the era in our minds. America was a very different place back then with a political landscape being reshaped by resurgent conservatism and Cold War skullduggery, and by a rampant consumer culture driven by an uneven economic boom in the later part of the decade that drew comparisons to the ‘Jazz Age’ of the 20s. It is exactly these features that provide a great basis for [[the Keeper]] to draw from for adventures, whether it is demonic Cabbage Patch Kids dolls or a rampaging giant Marshmallow Man inspired by *Ghostbusters*.

# Kids as Characters

*Monster of the Week* already has playbooks designed for kid characters:

[[The Chosen]], [[The Mundane]], and [[The Spooky]] in the rulebook, and The Meddling Kid (available online).

A campaign modeled on *Stranger Things* can include adults as well as kids. An adult mentor associated with the hunting group—like the grumpy but lovable Sheriff Hopper or Giles from Buffy—works fine.

As for the other basic playbooks:

**The Crooked:** If you re-imagine the underworld in a kid’s terms, it can work. A ‘King Rat’ kid who sells homework answers and forged permission slips might have fallen in with the supernatural. For [[inspiration]], you can also look to the film *Brick*, which imagines high school as a film noir, or *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* which depicts high school as a literal gateway to hell.

**The Divine:** A kid as an avatar or disguise is a nice fit for a campaign.

Keepers may want to check out the classic Cary Grant film *The Bishop’s*

*Wife* for ideas on how this could play. Your angel needs to remain disguised to regular folk. In *The Bishop’s Wife*, for example, the angel’s intervention is forgotten when his divine mission is completed.

**The Expert:** While this character playbook suggests for an older mentor, an uber-nerd kid who knows every comic book and monster manual backwards can be an amusing substitute, with a tree house as their sanctuary.

**The Spellslinger:** A spellcasting version of the nerd trope could also work for a Spellslinger. Imagine a small Harry Dresden or Harry Potter playing on the hockey team or as president of the high school magic club.

**The Flake:** A nerd type is the aspiring journalist, Kolchak fan obsessed with the latest cryptids and conspiracy theories.

**The Initiate:** A cult composed of children like in Stephen King’s

*Children of the Corn* is one way to go here, but if you think about it, almost any strange organization could be a cult and it doesn’t even have to be overtly religious. An ancient order of astrologers could be sending our young Initiate coded commands via a popular science program of the day like Carl Sagan’s *Cosmos* or the local astronomy club.

**The Monstrous:** A child vampire or teenage werewolf is not at all difficult to imagine and there are a wide variety of tropes in movies and television to draw [[inspiration]] from. From *My Best Friend is a Vampire* to the antics of various generations of Disney’s teenaged werewolves, the kid monster was a popular comedic subject. Buffy the Vampire Slayer elevated the material further in the 1990s. The key, as with [[the Divine]] playbook, is to hide the monster in the classroom. A more comedic campaign could have the community embrace the monster, especially if that player can lead a local high school team to victory.

# Inspiration from Other Worlds

A whole host of kid-centered horror games can provide [[inspiration]]. [[Examples]] include *Tales from the Loop*, *Grimm*, *Little Fears*, *Bubblegumshoe*, *Monsters and Other Childish Things*, *Dark Places and Demogorgons*, and *The Breakfast Cult*. While these systems have the advantage of being designed for kid-centered monster hunting, they should be used with caution. Almost all were designed for child characters, not monster hunting adolescents. Some have a focus outside where your group may want your campaign to go.

-   *The Breakfast Cult* turns high school into a wonderland of Lovecraftian cultists and a place where a child Initiate might fit in just fine. It’s also Powered by the Apocalypse, so its mechanics are more compatible with *Monster of the Week* than any of the other systems I have mentioned. *The Breakfast Cult* focuses on competing high school cults, so it’s only going to be useful if that’s a direction you want your game to go.

-   *Tales From The Loop* gives you great content ideas if you want science fiction inspired adventures in an alternate 1980s USA or Sweden.

-   *Little Fears* features supernatural adventures about young children. Earlier editions of the game were controversial for the use of adult horror tropes in that context.

-   *Dark Places and Demogorgons* is an old school D&D re-creation with classes based on *Breakfast Club* tropes: jock, nerd, popular girl, etc.

# Final Thoughts

In review, while *Monster of the Week* was not designed to be a kid monster hunting game set in the 1980s, there is no reason why it can’t be. The implied setting is flexible enough to handle the challenge with a little care from an intelligent group of hunters and their Keeper.

So whether you want to revisit the Reagan era or revamp your game with children from *Stranger Things*, a little tweaking may just provide the keys to your hunters’ DeLorean. Just buckle up and beware of Demogorgons!
