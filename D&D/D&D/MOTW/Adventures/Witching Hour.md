Witching Hour

*By Mark Tygart*

*“Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”* —Exodus 22:18

# Concept

[[The hunters]] investigate a mysterious clock-filled ‘haunted’ house.

This mystery was inspired by John Bellairs’ classic children’s novel of the supernatural *The House with a Clock in its Walls*.

# Hook

Zenobia Bellairs disappeared seven years ago, and her heir has been unable to sell her house due its cursed reputation. They have asked [[the hunters]] to investigate. Zenobia has studied necromancy to live beyond death and is now an undead monster hiding in the house. She preys on unwary tenants, armed with a [[Hand]] of Glory.

# Overview

In order to defeat Zenobia, [[the hunters]] have to find and open the secret room where the undead witch resides (except when she hunts during the ‘witching hour’).

# Investigation Notes

This mystery was written for a [[small]] party of ‘newbie hunters. Keepers with experienced or larger groups may want to modify the difficulty accordingly.

The primary threat is Zenobia Bellairs, the undead Witch. You may also add a burglar, thrill-seeking teenagers, traps, and the Witch’s enchanted human [[minions]].

[[Examples]] of human [[minions]] who the Witch controls include a psychotic handy-man or deranged gothic cultists. [[Examples]] traps include a **bear trap** (2-[[harm]]) and a **shotgun blast trap** (3-[[harm]]). Traps inflict their [[harm]] on hunters unless found and disarmed (see below).

If **a hunter looks for traps**, roll +[[Sharp]]:

On a 10+, the trap is disarmed and the hunter learns something about Zenobia.

On a 7-9, the trap goes off. [[The Keeper]] may choose one of the following effects:

-   The trap is sprung and the noises alert Zenobia.

-   The trap is sprung and the hunter takes 1-[[harm]].

-   The trap is sprung, separating a hunter from the others.

-   The trap is sprung, alerting someone else in the house.

-   The trap is sprung, making a noise, and Rose comes to investigate.

-   The trap is sprung, making a noise, and Serenna calls the police.

-   The trap is sprung and damages something important to [[the hunters]].

On a miss, the trap is sprung and the hunter takes full damage.

# Zenobia Bellairs, Undead Witch

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume people)* The corpse of Bellairs, still animated by her evil spirit. **Powers:**

-   **Consume**: Any [[harm]] she inflicts is absorbed to fuel her existence. Each point of [[harm]] caused by her life-draining touch adds one to her [[harm]] capacity. However it doesn’t last forever—each year, her capacity loses one point.

-   ![[image155.png]]**Summon Human [[Minions]]**: When in need, she may summon human followers (at [[the Keeper]]’s discretion).

-   **Creature of Darkness**: She can only leave her secret chamber (her tomb) between midnight and one in the morning (‘The Witching Hour’). She may not cross running water. Attacks that use rock salt will force her to return to her tomb.

**Attack:** **Touch** 1-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[life-drain]] [[ignore-armour]]. She also has a [[Hand]] of Glory (see page 82) and will use it. **[[Armour]]:** None.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7 (at the start). <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** She can only be killed if the Clock of Endor is destroyed.

# Rose Chang, Attractive Neighbor 

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)*

A popular local weather person, known for her zany antics and costumes as host of the *Wacky Weather* show on a local cable news channel. This attractive and romantically inclined young woman is disposed to fall in love with one of the brave, rugged hunters.

# Serenna Lansbury, Noisy Neighbor

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

Serenna is convinced Zenobia was involved with “the mafia” and that dead “goons” are buried in her basement.

A retired, kindly elementary school teacher, Serenna is very lonely and will provide [[the hunters]] with outrageous ideas and fringe theories for as long as they will listen.

# Malcolm Ford, Police Officer 

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

Malcolm thinks the whole “haunting” is hokum. [[The hunters]] are imagining things. Or maybe they’re grifters? A grumpy decorated police veteran of the inner cities, Ford is on the verge of retirement and bored with the relatively routine policing that this safe and affluent [[area]] usually requires.

# Lewis Barnavelt, Former Tenant 

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Lewis Barnavelt confesses to sympathetic hunters he had [[Weird]] dreams of “a ghost woman with a candle” while living in the Bellairs house. A middle-aged astronomer renowned for his work on black holes, Barnavelt dreams of being the next Carl Sagan or Neil deGrasse Tyson. He is writing a popular text on black holes for a lay audience. He dreads being ridiculed for his superstitious fear of the Bellairs House.

# Bellairs House 

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

The Bellairs house is not only decorated with a massive number of antique clocks but also with multiple pictures and framed quotations of King Saul’s doomed visit to the Witch of Endor in the Old Testament. In a few versions, the Witch even has a ‘[[Hand]] of Glory’ and the Witch is clearly Zenobia.

The sound of antique clocks constantly ticking is almost deafening.

Keepers who wish to place traps should put them in places that past tenants did not disturb, like a spooky locked room in the attic or in a dusty basement that hasn’t been disturbed for years. Thieves or teenagers may break into the house on any night, and the Witch has been trying to tempt Rose over with a nightly display of spooky lights. Any commotion is likely to summon Ford to investigate.

# Arcane Library 

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

This library contains [[many]] strange and troubling volumes (+1 if used for research during this mystery or in later adventures), as well as the hidden entrance to the Witch’s chamber.

The secret door may be found if all the other clocks in the house are stopped, as it ticks quite loudly (only stopping during the witching hour). A false volume on the library bookshelf entitled *The Christian Book of the Dead* opens the secret door behind a fake bookshelf, revealing the hidden room. This entrance is another good place to add a trap if [[the Keeper]] wants to increase this mystery’s difficulty.

A particularly enlarged copy of the painting *The Shade of Samuel Appears to Saul* hangs on the wall.

# Zenobia's Hidden Chamber 

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

This is a Universal monster movie backlot dream of a witch’s lair. Pentagrams and skulls fill the floor, and the walls are covered with paintings of Zenobia Bellairs at various stages of her life.

The Witch’s corpse usually rests in her favorite rocking chair and in this chamber, her tomb, it may reanimate whenever she desires. If disturbed, she will mentally summon [[whatever]] [[minions]] she has and try to paralyze [[the hunters]] with her [[Hand]] of Glory. It sits on the nearby desk, among candles that burn with pale green flames, a large mirror, scattered occult papers, a stuffed baboon and a shrunken head. She can light the [[Hand]] with a thought.

She may mock her victims to confuse them and buy time to gain her [[Hand]] of Glory and for her [[minions]] to arrive. She always carries her [[Hand]] of Glory when she hunts during the witching hour.

# The Clock of Endor

The enchanted clock is not difficult to destroy but the Witch will defend it frantically and summon any [[minions]] she may possess.

It is a large grandfather clock with images of the Witch of Endor, the spectre of Samuel, and the doomed King Saul carved into the woodwork. The clock’s ticking and chimes are unnaturally [[loud]]: hunters listening closely may suffer from the delusion that they are actually hearing the sound of a human heart. The chimes are deep and majestic. However, when compared to the other eldritch items in the hidden room, it seems almost reassuringly normal.

When the Witch manifests, the clock produces no noise at all, although it appears to function normally.

The best way to confound this necromancy is to burn the clock but a thorough smashing will do the job as well. When destroyed, all that is left is junk and the Witch’s skull, bones, and gleaming spectacles.
