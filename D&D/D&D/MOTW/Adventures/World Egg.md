World Egg

*By Marek Golonka*

# Introduction

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image156.png" style="width:5.99667in;height:5.21667in" />Lea Drittore, an occult scientist, discovered how to create ‘World Eggs.’ These are mystical gems that [[feed]] on auras in their surroundings and then hatch into pocket dimensions inhabited by golems.

In her lab, Drittore only managed to create worlds that echo herself and the sterile environment, so she submitted an Egg to a local gem fair. She wants it to be bought and to experience the auras of many different people and places. Then she’ll get it back and explore the rich, complex artificial world that results: the ultimate goal of her research.

# Hooks

Potential leads include:

-   [[The hunters]] receive a letter (or mystical transmission) from a panicked creature trapped in a pocket dimension—one of Lea’s golems.

-   One of [[the hunters]] studied with Lea and is paying her a visit just as things get out of control.

-   A divination predicts Lea has a big chance of starting the Apocalypse.

-   By messing up with occult rituals, [[the hunters]] end up in one of Lea’s pocket dimensions.

-   One of [[the hunters]] detects the presence of a powerful artefact in the city.

-   [[The hunters]] are keeping watch on Maurizia, a fence who seems to read occult auras.

-   One of the important characters is an old friend or enemy of [[the hunters]].

# The Unhatched Egg

*Phenomenon: Experiment (motivation: to unleash dangers)*

The World Egg is sensitive to everything around it. It reads auras and compiles the data into a pocket dimension. After a month or so it

‘hatches’ by bursting into an immobile portal about the size of a typical door: a rip in our reality leading into the newborn world. The portal is visible in our world but usually not from inside the pocket dimension.

The more auras the Egg reads, the bigger and more complex a world it creates. Such worlds may contain life or life-like entities. Creatures created this way may visit our world if they find the portal out.

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image157.jpg" style="width:6in;height:3.4028in" />The Egg is resistant to accidental damage but if hit really hard (3-[[harm]] in a single strike) it breaks and hatches prematurely into a Voidmouth: an occult black hole that first swallows everything nearby and then gradually pulls more distant objects into itself, annihilating them. It would need about a month to swallow an entire city.

Sealing a Voidmouth requires a **big magic** ritual with the following requirements:

-   Three or more participants.

-   All participants must have not destroyed anything or harmed anybody for last three days.

-   They must use the rituals and equipment used to create the Egg.

-   The equipment must be adjusted for the ritual by a competent occult scientist.

# Lea Drittore

*Monster: Breeder (motivation: to bring forth evil)*

Lea has spent her entire life researching Kabbalah, demonology, and quantum physics in order to discover the secrets of alternate dimensions. She isn’t so much evil as immoral and obsessed. After decades of research, she even discovered how to loosen her own anchor to our world and teleport herself. **Powers:**

-   **Teleport**: She can get to any place within a few miles that is not specifically warded. Teleporting normally takes a few seconds. She can do it instantly (to avoid [[harm]]) but then she ends up stunned and unable to teleport for about a minute.

-   **Occult Science**: She has many strange devices that bend space and manipulate distances.

**Attacks:** **Heighten gravity** 2-[[harm]] far area forceful ignore-[[armour]].

**Harm capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** Pocket dimensions: Her power to **teleport** doesn’t work in dimensions created by World Eggs or in other places where space is disrupted. Hunters can create such disruptions with **big magic**.

# Lea's Lab

*Location: Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)*

Lea’s lab is a cross between a high-tech physics facility and a medieval alchemist’s laboratory. It’s full of modern devices used for electricity, gravity, and particle observation. There’s a diploma on the wall stating that Lea worked for CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), but also runes carved on laptops and other electronics, a

‘telescope’ that shows a metaphorical image of the soul of the person looking through it, and a big mystical circle for rituals.

# World Egg Golems

*Minions: Guardians (motivation: to protect the lab and Drittore)*

These are humanoid animate objects from the pocket worlds. Most look like people made from rare minerals, metals, laboratory apparatus, or raw energy. They are reflections of Lea’s aura so they always have at least one of the following traits:

-   Curious.

-   Smart.

-   Driven.

-   Power-hungry.

Most of the golems don’t know about the world beyond their dimensions and will be very angry at Lea for keeping them in the dark about it. **Attacks:** **Slam** 3-[[harm]] hand messy.

**Harm capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> **Armour:** 2. Made of minerals.

# The Runaway Golem

*Minion: Traitor (motivation: to betray people)*

This golem is both curious and power-hungry. It knows about the outside world and wants to use the Egg to hatch a pocket dimension within another one, believing this will create a portal between all the worlds Lea has made and allow him to unite all golems under his rule. This golem looks like a bulky, short man made of glass lenses and steel beams. It has no name but will gladly accept one if someone suggests something.

**Attacks:** **Slam** 3-[[harm]] hand messy. **Stolen gravity gun** 2-[[harm]] close area forceful ignore-[[armour]].

**Harm capacity:** 10. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> **Armour:** 2. Made of minerals.

# The Hatchery

*Location: Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)*

The portals to the pocket dimensions are in a small room called the Hatchery. By stepping through one of the portals you can find yourself in:

-   A giant fluid iron sigil floating in the void. Its golem inhabitants change their behaviour when the sigil changes.

-   An exact replica of Lea’s lab overcrowded with metallic copies working restlessly to create more of themselves.

-   A tunnel full of giant balls that behave like particle parts… or maybe they really are particle parts and you shrank to the sub-sub-atomic level as you entered?

-   An endless maze of mine tunnels with gem-rock golems (like the runaway one) looking for better and better techniques to mine ores and then using these ores to divine their futures.

-   Other strange worlds themed after aspects of Lea’s work, [[history]], and personality.

# Andreo Bruno

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

A thief, sly and streetwise, but clueless about the supernatural. He had been casing Lea’s house. Sometimes shows his loot to Maurizia. **Attacks:** **Knife** 1-[[harm]] hand.

**Harm capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Maurizia Diori

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)*

A fence with a sense of the supernatural, she earns a living by buying seemingly worthless trinkets with occult power and selling them to those in the know.

**Attacks:** **Thin, runed stiletto** 1-[[harm]] hand magic.

**Harm capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Aftermath

After so much fighting over it, the Egg from this mystery will probably hatch into a violent world full of conflict between sly and brutal lifeforms inspired by thieves and golems. It still has about two weeks until it hatches, however—so [[the hunters]] might expose it to peaceful stimuli and make it less dangerous. If they do so, the new-born dimension can become a Haven for the entire party with two or three traits determined by what has happened to the Egg.

On the other hand, if a Voidmouth is born, there might be a hellish dimension on the other side of it just as some scientists speculate that black holes can be used for hyperspace travelling. All manner of [[monsters]], occultists and fringe scientists can be willing to explore the Voidmouth, making it hard for [[the hunters]] to seal it.
