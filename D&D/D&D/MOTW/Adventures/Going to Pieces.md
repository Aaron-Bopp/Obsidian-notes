Going to Pieces

*By Sophie Lagacé*

# Concept

![[image120.png]]A series of animal mutilations and killings are blamed on Preĝo practitioners. But the latter are really trying to ward against a new threat: a necromancer preparing a ritual that will grant mastery over an army of nightwalkers (the immigrants are calling them “chupacabras”). Nightwalkers have already started hunting in the Cook County forests, where the Preĝo community practices their religion.

This mystery assumes the necromancer is an old foe of [[the hunters]] who was defeated and now plans revenge. Fill in the details for a suitable character from your game.

## Preĝo

This is a fictitious syncretic religion, built from aspects of the community’s ancestral cultures and influences from other cultures since leaving their homelands (which was not always voluntary). The name comes from the Esperanto word for “prayer.” Preĝo practices include wilderness shrines at sacred places, and some animal sacrifice.

# Hook

[[The hunters]] investigate the latest in a series of animal killings in Cook County Forest Preserves. Dead goats and chickens have been found at

Oak Glen Preserve in a Chicago neighbourhood along the northern edge of the city.

# The Necromancer

*Monster: Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)*

He remembers when [[the hunters]] defeated him before, oh yes he does. They killed him once; he wants to return the favour. He selected the nightwalkers as his tools because they are a corrupt form of werecreatures: he plans on draining [[the hunters]] of life and having them torn to pieces by nightwalkers. **Powers:**

-   **Phylactery**: Keeps his soul safe.

-   **Powerful [[Magic]]**: Can use any of the normal **[[Use Magic]]** effects freely.

-   **[[Advanced Arcane Training]]**: He only needs two out of [[Foci]], [[Gestures]], and [[Incantations]] to perform [[magic]].

-   **Necromantic Blast, Necromantic Wall, Withering Touch, Memory Theft** (see attacks below). **Attacks:**

-   **Ritual dagger** 2-[[harm]] [[hand]].

-   **Necromantic blast** 2-[[harm]] [[close]] magical obvious [[ignore-armour]] [[life-drain]].

-   **Necromantic wall** 1-[[harm]] [[close]] magical [[barrier]] 1-[[armour]] obvious [[loud]] [[life-drain]].

-   **Withering touch** 4-[[harm]] [[intimate]] magical obvious [[ignore-armour]] [[life-drain]].

-   **Memory theft** 0-[[harm]] [[intimate]] magical [[ignore-armour]] 1-memory.

**[[Armour]]:** 1-[[armour]] (always prepared!)

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 12 [[harm]], but will flee when he receives 6-[[harm]].

\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\] Flee \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\] Dead

**Weakness:** A **[[Big Magic]]** ritual is required to wrench his soul from its phylactery and destroy both soul and phylactery. It must be performed within one midnight of his death (before or after) and takes six hours to cast. It requires the phylactery itself, **[[Use Magic]]**, and several rare ingredients that might be mysteries in their own right to obtain.

# Preĝo Believers

*[[Bystanders]]: Victims (motivation: to put themselves in danger)*

Mostly of Latinx and Afro-Caribbean descent. They might go out looking for the people really behind the animal killings, or be on the streets to patrol and defend their community. They could even regard [[the hunters]] as a threat—who are these people hanging around asking questions?

**Attacks:** **Ordinary [[weapons]]** 2-[[harm]] hand/close.

# Nightwalkers

*[[Minions]]: Brutes (motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

A couple of nightwalkers who are already on board with the Necromancer’s plan, either for their own reasons or because he subdued them. They look like like large misshapen dog silhouettes made of pure darkness, bristling with spines, their red eyes glowing like embers. **Powers:**

-   **Night Walker**: A nightwalker can disappear into the darkness, reappearing in its den. It cannot be tracked home, as it did not walk through the intervening space.

-   **Horrifying Yell**: Anyone who hears the howl of the nightwalker must take –1 [[ongoing]] unless they **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to resist the fear. **Attacks:**

-   **Bite** 1-[[harm]] [[hand]].

-   **Blood-suck** (must **bite** first): 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]].

**[[Armour]]:** None. **Weaknesses:**

-   Sunlight.

-   [[Magic]].

-   Enclosure (if you can trap it within an enclosed [[area]], it may not night-walk away and may be killed).

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 5 [[harm]], but they will flee when they reach 3 [[harm]].

<sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> Flee <sup>\[\]\[\]</sup> Dead

# Kathy Witecki

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

A retired Chicago Police Department deputy chief. She has lived near the edge of Oak Glen for 40 years. She is an older white woman with short gray hair, [[Sharp]] eyes, and a fit and trim body. She sees a lot but she no longer gets paid to stick her nose in other people’s business.

*“Every time you see the blood, it brings a little horror back to you—you always feel for the animals, you know?”*

# Billy Washington

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

Has worked in the Cook County Forest Preserves for 36 years as part of the landscape maintenance crew. Ageing black man with thinning curly gray hair, timid eyes, and gnarly knuckled-hands, of medium height and stocky frame. He’s a peaceful man who loves to work outdoors, except on really cold and rainy days (snow is okay). He lets people be, but he’s well aware he could be blamed for the incidents (remember the 1996

Atlanta Olympics bombing?)

*“I’d just be guessing. I’m American, I don’t know nothing about that ritual stuff.”*

# Dr. Craig O'Sullivan

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

A Northwestern University theology professor, who has studied Preĝo as part of his research. A frail elderly white man with thinning wispy white hair and horn-rimmed glasses. He can go on for hours about minute theoretical details but he stayed well away from going to look at the dead carcasses himself. That’s what grad students are for.

*“Preĝo sacrifices are strict and respectful. Prayers have to be said, the blade has to be a certain style and sharpness. It’s as humane a killing of an animal as can be.”*

Debra Priest, Esq.

*Bystander: Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)*

A real estate attorney, NWU lecturer, and animal rights lawyer who is a former director of Chicago’s Animal Control Department. A white woman with long, curly, slightly graying hair, a medium body, and a friendly attitude which turns to anger when she talks about [[harm]] to animals. She genuinely cares about animal protection, but she also deplores that the animal killings lower property values in otherwise nice areas nearby.

*“Illinois’ Humane Care for Animals Act is a neutral law; it’s not true that we’re targeting religious activity.”*

# Callista Theodorakis

*Bystander: Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Cook County Forest Preserves spokeswoman and former reporter at local station WCHI-TV. A trim, handsome, white but dusky woman in her late 40s, with shoulder-length brown hair, and an easy poise.

*“We respect everyone’s freedom of religion, but if we see someone suspicious, we’ll take action under the state law.”*

# Gabriela Cruz

*Bystander: Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)*

Runs Botanica de San Jeronimo on the South Side. An older hispanic light-skinned ‘morisca’ woman with a white headscarf, big glasses and a wide smile. She is short and chubby. Gabriela is a herbalist and an advocate for and member of the Preĝo community. She also holds a degree in Pharmacology but doesn’t brag about it unless she needs to placate the law enforcement.

*“A lot of people, they misunderstand us. They think we work with the devil, but it’s not like that.”*

# Botanica de San Jeronimo

*Location: Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)*

On the South Side, Gabriela Cruz’ herbal shop. Non-hispanics mostly just call the place “Botanica.” The place is filled with little bottles, envelopes filled with dried herbs, an array of teapots, strainers, vaporizers, candles, statuettes of the saints, charms, calendars, etc.

# Forest Preserves

*Location: Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

The first Forest Preserve [[the hunters]] will encounter is likely to be Oak

Glen, but this write-up can work for most of them. [[Many]] facilities can be found near the entrances of each preserve location (over 300 sites in the district!), but the woods soon thicken with distance, especially in the [[locations]] where incidents have occurred. Some—but not all—preserves have well-marked trails, picnic tables, interpretive signs (sometimes duplicated), and even lodges. But away from these, the underbrush gets thick and the trees grow [[close]] together.

**[[Custom moves]]:**

When you **search in the forest**, roll +[[Sharp]]:

-   On a 10+, things seem to point somewhere in particular: take +1 [[forward]] for investigating.

-   On a 7-9, you can **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**, but then pick one of the bad things below.

-   On a miss, all three bad things are true. Bad things that can happen in the forest:

-   Something is following you.

-   You are lost, and your phone and GPS are not working properly.

-   You stumble upon something abominable.

# Wolf Road Woods Forest Preserves

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbor [[monsters]])*

[[The hunters]]’ investigation of Billy Washington’s disappearance will eventually lead them to Wolf Road Woods, where the nightwalkers have their temporary lair.

**[[Custom moves]]:**

When you **search in Wolf Road Woods**, roll +[[Sharp]]:

-   On a 10+ you find a tuft of strange hair and a well-worn work glove with Billy’s initials: take +1 [[forward]] for investigating, then [[the Keeper]] will pick one of the bad things from **search in the forest** (see above).

-   On a 7-9, you find the clues but all three bad things are true.

-   On a miss, you are attacked by nightwalkers.

# Information That Can Be Gathered

Animal parts have shown up in Cook County Forest Preserves to the west, south and northwest of the city, according to half a dozen police reports filed this year and last year. Most of the time, it’s just the parts.

In cardboard boxes, plastic sacks, or at the base of a tree clustered with tokens of ritual—a swatch of red or white cloth, a little wooden box—they’ve been finding chicken heads with their eyes gouged out, and dismembered goats. Just last weekend, blood stains on newly-fallen snow led residents to two baby goat heads and a number of chicken parts, wrapped up in red bandanas. *Basic:* Animal remains found include chickens (both hens and roosters), goats, pigeons, rabbits, cat, skunk, and deer carcasses. *Advanced:* Only the livestock remains were accompanied by red and white cloth strips.

According to residents near various Forest Preserves, this has been going for at least 30 years.

Only once in recent memory—the incident [[the hunters]] are investigating—has a report come in of someone being caught in the act of a suspected ritual sacrifice. A few days ago, a caller reported seeing five people “dressed all in white” in Oak Glen: they appeared to be “doing animal sacrifices on chickens and roosters.” By the time the police arrived, there was nothing to see.

The Cook County Forest Preserves encompass about 70,000 acres

(280 square kilometers)—11 percent of the county. About 100 officers police the [[area]].

**If [[the hunters]] correlate sites over time and [[area]]:** although it’s hard to discern by looking at a specific location, incidents across all forest preserves in Cook County have suddenly increased in frequency.

Live animals, possibly escaped from attempted sacrifices, have been found wandering in the woods.

[[Small]] makeshift altars have also been found in the woods, with candle stubs, wilted flowers, keepsakes, images of saints, and dried herbs. The herbs and other ingredients include tobacco, jimsonweed (datura), foxglove (digitalis), Jesuit’s bark (quinine), garlic, velvetleaf, lemongrass, thyme, and monkshood (wolfsbane), honey, powdered eggshell, cocoa butter, ash, aguardiente, and water.

**Investigating the magics performed at the altars** requires a lot of legwork to examine [[many]] sites. *Basic:* A variety of magics were performed: blessings, divinings, intercessions, atonements, and even the rare curse; some altars show no [[magic]] at all. *Advanced:* The most recent magics have been wardings.

**Investigating the attack on Kathy Witecki:** *Basic:* Kathy walked away from the path that day, and towards an altar. *Advanced:* She actually checked on several spots in the preserve where incidents had been reported over the years.

**If Kathy wakes up after the attack and [[the hunters]] interview her:** *Basic:* Kathy has suffered from the Necromancer’s memory theft attack. Her memory is affected and she can’t recall much from the day of the attack, except a dark shadow with long spikes, and a man with eyes like glowing embers. *Advanced:* Even some details that she recently told [[the hunters]] have been forgotten.

**Investigation of Billy Washington’s disappearance:** *Basic:* He was working alone at the time of the attack and was near a forest altar— tending it. *Advanced:* [[Close]] examination by a knowledgeable person would suggest Billy didn’t exactly know what he was doing; he was just trying to fix it up as best he could.
