Haunting at the Old Grand

*By Chloe Sutherland*

# Concept

Deep in the bowels of a historic hotel, abandoned for more than a century, awaits one of the Great Old Ones. It traps spirits in the hotel to build up its power in order to emerge into our dimension.

Our investigators are the last of a long line of victims—caught when they came to investigate the “most bloody building in the world.” They have been devoured by the monster inhabiting the hotel, and will wander the halls forever unless they can work out what has happened to them.

# Hook

The flashlight scans across the crumbling facade, eventually alighting upon the police tape wrapping around the building. A hand pushes aside the tape and the group of investigators duck under it. As one wrangles bolt cutters around the padlock, another starts riffling through a brimming case folder.

*“They come in. They don’t come out. Dozens—maybe more we don’t know about. Keep your wits about you.”*

Everyone steps across the threshold and is swallowed by the darkness of the hotel.

The door slams shut.

# Keeper Notes

[[The hunters]] begin as ghosts. As a result of their deaths, your hunters cannot properly remember the past week and do not realise what has happened. Pick your language carefully to support this. For example, instead of saying someone opens a book, describe the pages fluttering in an unseen breeze and falling to the right page. You might use the move **separate them** to have someone accidentally move to another section of the hotel, as they do not have full control of their ghostly body. If they fail an attack roll, describe their weapon seeming to pass directly through the target.

Your hunters’ limitations may depend on what has already been set up in the world, however it is likely they:

-   cannot easily interact with anything in the hotel.

-   will cause magical rather than physical damage.

-   will be burned by silver.

-   will become trapped by salt circles.

-   will float rather than walk.

# Old One

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume people)*

The Old One is massive and octopus-like, spanning floors. It cannot move from the large hollowed-out cavern below the hotel, after a failed ritual caused it to become trapped in a portal between worlds. Its tentacles reach out on all sides of the portal, surrounding a large beak with multiple rows of large teeth. Once it has trapped a being inside the hotel, it drags them to the basement to devour them. With enough blood, the Old One will be able to complete the ritual properly, finally releasing itself into the world. **Powers:**

-   **Long Range Grasp**: The Old One has many tentacles, two of them are extra long. With these, it can pick up investigators if they are within reach (range: hotel basement) and will be a constant source of pressure within the basement.

-   **Great Old Grand**: Over time, the Old One has reached other tentacles up through the floors and walls of the old hotel. This is how it is able to trap people inside and it also means it is aware of where a living/moving being is in the hotel at all times.

**Attacks:** **Serrated suckers** 2-[[harm]] far/intimate life-drain. **Gaping maw** 4-[[harm]] intimate ignore-[[armour]].

**Harm Capacity:** 10-[[harm]] with two extra long tentacles (5-[[harm]], each).

-   Body: \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]

-   Tentacle 1: <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> Tentacle 2: <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:**

**Eldritch Ritual:** The Old One was brought into this realm by an eldritch ritual that was incorrectly carried out by hotel guests. This was done by carving and painting sigils around the hotel and in the basement. If these five sigils can be found and destroyed (by causing 2-[[harm]] to each), the portal will be destroyed and the Old One will no longer be tethered between worlds.

# Kel Priestly, werewolf and supernatural detective

*Bystander: Hunter (motivation: to kill the [[monsters]]), later*

*Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

![[image126.jpg]]Kel is a hunter (similar to [[the Monstrous]] playbook) who has come to investigate the Old Grand after [[the hunters]] went missing over a week ago. Convinced he is dealing with typical ghosts, he is armed with salt bullets and will attack on sight. If they take the time, [[the hunters]] will notice Kel is less wolf-like than typical werewolves: he still stands as a human, has use of his hands and feet, and can speak (although gutturally and infrequently while fighting). If they can convince him they mean no [[harm]], he may become an ally. If not, his supernatural PI licence and hunter’s notes will be found on his body.

**Attacks:** **Shotgun with salt bullets** 4-[[harm]] close messy loud anti-ghost. **Teeth** 2-[[harm]] intimate. **Armour:** 1. Very tough.

**Harm Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:** Silver, Wolfsbane, Magic.

# The Old Grand

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

Once the door closes, the hotel is no longer linked to the present. Looking outside will reveal the shadowy memories of The Old Grand in its former glory. Phone calls or radio out will connect to people long since dead, or just to the low rattling groans of the Old One.

Any attempt to leave will fail until the Old One is defeated: the hotel will only allow exit once the Old One is no longer controlling it—once the sigils have been broken and its connection with the Other World has been severed. These sigils can only be broken by physical damage.

The Old Grand sits just as it was abandoned over a century ago when cultists carried out various rituals in an attempt to bring the Old One forth. As they look around, investigators will find ritual [[spell books]] and the personal diaries of the cultists in some of the rooms, as well as evidence of the rituals carried out. The library may also contain information about the [[history]] of the location.

The investigators may find evidence of their physical selves, such as a unique item dropped around the hotel before they were killed and captured.

# Other Threats

Other eldritch beings may be residing in the hotel, having snuck through the open portal, their own strength waning as the Old One drains their life.

Other spirits may be briefly seen or heard around the hotel. This may include ghosts of the cultists, who have useful information but will not part with it willingly.

# Custom Moves

**Shades from the past**: As [[the hunters]] start to realise their situation, they may get flashbacks to what happened. As they are presented with additional information, an investigator may **investigate a mystery** (using Weird instead of Sharp) to recall relevant information in the form of a vision of the lost time.

The investigators will be able to **resurrect**—see page 112 of *Monster of the Week*. The **big magic** requires:

-   Their souls.

-   The blood of the Old One.

-   To be carried out at the site of their death (the basement).

-   Only one person is needed to conduct the ritual.
