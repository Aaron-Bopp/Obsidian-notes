The Crystal Assassin

*By Luke Green*

# Concept

Celino Adessi, a mystical assassin, summons extradimensional entities to kill for her. The creatures transform her victims into crystalline statues, which she breaks up and sells—doubling her profit. This denies the creatures any chance to [[Feed]], and they are getting hungry.

# Hook

Possible leads:

-   [[The hunters]] notice that in a recent gang war, one side of the conflict has people dying but the other side’s people are simply vanishing.

-   A hunter with criminal ties receives a dead drop package from one of the people who has gone missing. This could be a Crooked, an ex-cop getting info from an old snitch, etc.

-   One of [[the hunters]] (or someone they know) happens upon a crystal head in a pawn shop and realizes there’s a soul trapped inside.

-   Serenity Evans has become concerned that her pupil Adessi has gotten herself into trouble.

# Celino Adessi, Occult Assassin

*Monster: Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)*

Celino Adessi is the daughter of a crooked businessman and a witch. She watched as her parents used their particular skills to protect their family.

However, both parents made the effort to keep the other at least partially in the dark: her mother not showing her magical talents and her father glossing over his shady dealings. Neither was aware of how closely their daughter was watching them.

She [[learned]] how to summon the mantids and considers this a wonderful find: they are stealthy and kill in such a way that the remains can be sold.

She also gets an emotional thrill out of denying her summoned mantids the chance to devour their prey. This reaffirms her control over the situation. She also has a perverse satisfaction in knowing her targets’ souls are trapped in those crystals for eternity, often wondering what it must feel like to be shattered and scattered across space in different pieces.

Adessi has not faced any real obstacles in her life to date and this has built her ego to dangerous levels. She prefers ‘removing’ powerful or important people, as it affirms her sense of superiority. Since her actions started being discussed in the media, she felt such a thrill that she has grown more reckless. **Powers:**

-   **Cursed Halls**: Adessi can etch runes in a location in order to create reality- and perception-bending effects. She may transform any location into a Maze, Prison, or Deathtrap.

-   **Summoner**: She can summon and command creatures from other dimensions, with the mantids obviously being her favourites.

-   **Magician**: She knows other [[magic]] spells too, mostly wards and protective blessings.

**Attacks:** **Handguns** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[loud]].

**[[Armour]]:** 2 if prepared for a fight (tactical [[gear]] and wards), 1 otherwise (normal wards only).

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** Adessi is a normal human being. The trick is getting past her protections and summons.

**Powers:**

-   **[[Flight]] .**

-   **Stealth**: The mantids exist in a phase of reality that living eyes can see quite well but technology can only catch fragments of. On camera, the mantid might present an occasional glimmer when viewed full on, with full silhouettes being caught rarely and usually on the edges of an image. Mantids are aware of when they are under a camera’s eye and will be careful when they can be recorded. If there is an active queen, they stop caring about being seen.

-   **Crystallize**: Their bite transforms bodies into soul-trapping crystals. A bitten hunter becomes [[unstable]] as their body begins to crystallize and they are completely transformed once all [[harm]] is marked off. The process can only be stopped with [[magic]] (**[[Use Magic]]** to banish a curse), **[[Weird Science]]**, or some other special method. When the whole body is crystal, the soul is trapped inside (normally the mantid devours it soon after). Mantids are able to produce a queen; some suggestions for how are listed below.

-   **Devouring**: When it eats a crystallized prey and the soul within, it heals 2-[[harm]].

**Weaknesses:**

-   High-frequency sound pulses or sonic attacks (these shatter the mantids’ [[structure]]).

-   **[[Use Magic]]** to banish a spirit. This will permanently destroy a mantid. **Attacks:**

-   **Claws** 5-[[harm]] [[close]] grappling.

-   **Stinger** 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] paralyze.

-   **Bite** 3-[[harm]] [[intimate]] crystallize (see powers, above).

**[[Armour]]:** 2 against mundane [[harm]], 0 against magical [[harm]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 6. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**Totally Crystallized**: What if a hunter or bystander is completely crystallized? Possible post-transformation cures include:

-   Altering the crystal so the soul within can animate it. Probably a temporary measure until something better can be found!

-   A **[[Big Magic]]** effect to revert the body to flesh. This might require studying the supernatural venom of the mantid’s bite.

-   Creating a clone body via science or [[magic]] and transferring the soul to the new body. This will require dissolving the crystal body in a special solution to free the soul. The risk is that once the soul is free of the crystal, it will pass on to the afterlife rather than successfully transferring to a new body.

# Crystal Queen

*Monster: Breeder (motivation: to give birth to, bring forth or create evil)*

When a crystal queen appears, the mantids are able to spawn easily.

The queen is able to speak: she presents the appearance of rationality, but she only cares about spreading the mantid swarm and overrunning the world.

![[image101.png]]When four mantids are present, they will summon a queen which appears as a simple block of crystal capable of extending spines from its side to serve as limbs.

If you prefer, here are two alternate methods (you might come up with your own too):

-   If the original summoner is crystallized, they become a queen. In this case, they will appear as a crystal version of themselves, but their mind and soul becomes devoted to the swarm.

-   A queenless mantid becomes a queen if it devours seven souls. In this case she looks like a smaller mantid, with four claw arms instead of two.

**Powers:**

-   **Mantid Hivemind**: All nearby crystal mantids gain focus and intelligence.

-   **Spawn**: Create new mantids. The queen takes any crystallized person and converts their soul into a new mantid. This takes several minutes. The new mantid has normal abilities, but looks like a hybrid of a ‘regular’ mantid and the person who was crystallized.

-   **Crystallize**: as regular mantid.

-   **Devour**: as regular mantid.

**Attacks:** Depending on physical form:

-   **Humanoid:** **Crystal arms** 2-[[harm]] [[hand]] grab. **Kiss** 0-[[harm]] [[intimate]] crystallize.

-   **Insectile:** **Claws** 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] grab. **Bite** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]] crystallize.

-   **Living Crystal Shard:** **Grown spikes** 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] grapple. **Crystal dust** 0-[[harm]] [[intimate]] inhaled crystallize.

**[[Armour]]:** 3 against mundane [[harm]], 0 against magical [[harm]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 10 <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:**

**Ritual Exorcism:** The queen’s body must be ground to dust and purified (otherwise the queen’s soul will soon possess another nearby mantid). The ritual involved will require the following:

-   High-frequency tones. Dozens upon dozens of wind chimes encircling the dust and kept constantly in motion would be a good example. A large enough flock of birds with a highpitched cry might also work, though getting the flock to stay for the ritual might require [[magic]] itself.

-   A ritual leader and at least two helpers (the higher their voices the better) performing a chant which gives further shape to the sounds used.

-   Someone might get the idea to use tech to replicate the sounds of wind chimes or record one voice and repeat it. This will only work if they have figured out the mantids are slightly out of phase from most tech and created something to deal with it.

# Serenity Evans

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

Evans is the occultist who originally taught Adessi. She has deep knowledge but middling powers. She appears to be about 70 but is actually over 150.

![[image102.jpg]]In the [[Mystic]] community, she is known as a crafter of sanctums, hidden places, vaults, and the like. She has also mentored a fair number of psychics.

Evans is unaware that Adessi has been using her powers for murderous ends. However, Evas periodically performs divinations to check up on her old students. Until recently, Adessi’s use of summoned creatures has kept Serenity from noticing anything—but as the assassin begins to get a greater thrill out of her murders these divinations have been growing darker. Serenity assumes Adessi is in trouble and needs help. Since she has found it difficult to reach her old student, she might ask [[the hunters]] to investigate. She may or may not know of Adessi’s mother, but certainly never met the woman. Note that Adessi’s ‘Cursed Hall’ is based on perversions of spells taught by Serenity.

# Marcus Eiger

*Minion: Cultist (motivation: to save his own skin at all cost)*

Eiger is Adessi’s fence, a position he fell into unintentionally. Previously, he was just a greedy gallery owner. When Adessi started to sell her victims’ remains she determined that Eiger would serve her purposes.

He originally thought she was a forger or thief but could never track down the source of the hyper-realistic pieces she provided. He eventually recognized the face of a missing mafia figure from the news and made a foolish attempt to blackmail Adessi. She responded by sending a mantid to his gallery and crystallizing his assistant. Marcus is now utterly terrified of Adessi and absolutely refuses to do anything that might annoy her again.

The moment he can safely betray her, he will do it in the blink of an eye.

# Quincey Francetti

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

The leader of a local contingent of mafia who has been finding himself on the losing end of a gang war. After witnessing [[monsters]] turn his men into crystal statues, he’s ready to leave town.

# Junoichi Kenta

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to place himself in danger)*

This yakuza oyabun first started using Adessi as an assassin after she handled a problem for him five years ago. He has never met her faceto-face. Adessi’s effectiveness and secrecy is worrying him now, so he’s planning to kill her.
