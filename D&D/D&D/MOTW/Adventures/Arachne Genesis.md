Arachne Genesis

*By Luke Green*

# Concept

Doctor Atsuko Popov is a scientist from a race of spider-people, called the gumo, born from the accidental release of a bioweapon in the early days of the Cold War. Her obsessive efforts to recreate the original mutation have led her to kidnap and experiment on humans and spider-people alike. Until now, her creations have been short-lived and unpredictable. She kept most of them locked up, but others were released into the tunnels under the city. After dissecting a first-generation gumo, she found the original bioweapon and is now unknowingly creating a deadly plague.

# The Gumo

There are different varieties of gumo, some quite easily able to pass for human and others with obvious spider-like features. Their personalities and morality are in the normal human range. Mostly they keep themselves hidden, in fear of humanity’s reaction. The gumo are a mortal species, but some have psychic abilities.

It is up to [[the Keeper]] whether they are a minor or major part of the setting.

# Hook

Some possibilities:

-   Another team of hunters has gone missing after looking into rumors of sewer [[monsters]].

-   A series of murders in high-security buildings has police stumped due to the lack of apparent access.

-   A disturbingly deformed corpse was recently discovered.

-   The goddess Arachne sends dreams to one of [[the hunters]].

# Gumo Plague

*Phenomenon: Biohazard (motivation: to infect, [[harm]] and spread)*

As the mystery begins, Dr Popov has recreated the mutagenic bioweapon. She doesn’t realise it yet. She took genetic samples from the first-generation gumo who survived the original bioweapon, and her own research ‘reawakened’ the plague.

Lifespan: As the plague mutates, each generation of infected arachnoids lives twice as long as the previous one.

**Powers:**

**Cunning**: Infected arachnoids become feral and violent, but are capable of a greater degree of cunning than the original gumos. Arachnoids can set traps and be wary of security cameras etc. Some arachnoids might start to figure out they can infect others and may seek to do so rather than kill people. The motive for doing so varies from individual to individual. Some might be trying to punish enemies while others might want to reunite with loved ones.

**Infectious**: If **a hunter suffers [[harm]] from an arachnoid bite**, instead of the normal **[[harm]]** move, use this one. Roll +[[Tough]]:

-   On a 10 or more, they resist the infection and gain +1 [[ongoing]] to resist the infection in the future. If they already have +1 [[ongoing]], they are now totally immune to the plague.

-   On a 7-9, the infected person starts at the Day level of the infection countdown (detailed below).

-   On a miss, the infected person starts at the Sunset level of the infection countdown.

**Weakness:** Treating individuals one at a time takes too long to cure the plague: more victims will be infected too fast. [[The hunters]] must find someone who has become immune to the plague (perhaps one of their own number), then they can create a vaccine that can be mass-produced. This will prevent new infections from occurring and thus allow authorities to deal with the already-infected on a case-by-case basis.

**[[Custom moves]]:**

**The Plague**: The plague progresses in stages as detailed below. Danger, fear, and anger cause it to advance more quickly. [[The Keeper]] has discretion over what exactly causes the infection to advance a stage—this could be a potential consequence or choice on a 7-9 or miss result for the hunter’s [[moves]].

**Infection Countdown:**

-   Day: The injury feels itchy and the character develops a fever.

-   Shadows: The character experiences a growing headache and nausea.

-   Sunset: The first visible signs of mutation appear.

-   Dusk: The pain makes rational thought incredibly difficult.

-   Nightfall: The character develops severe spider-like mutations.

-   Midnight: The character seems completely monstrous. Rational thought is nearly impossible.

**Cure:** A person whose immune system is boosted by [[magic]] or science can fight off the transformation with regular **[[Use Magic]]** or **[[Weird Science]]**. Other [[Weird]] [[moves]] might also apply if the hunter comes up with a good way to use them. It is not so simple to cure someone who has completed the transformation. This is a situation requiring major effort, **[[Big Magic]]** or a **[[Weird Science]]** experiment. The following elements will be needed:

-   The individual to be cured must be present for the procedure.

-   Some sample or representation of the person they were before: a treasured item or [[Sympathetic Token]] for a magical approach, or a genetic sample for a scientific approach.

-   A few days to study the changes between the past and current version of the person. This could be an opportunity to **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**.

-   A **[[Use Magic]]** or **[[Weird Science]]** move.

# Dr. Atsuko Popov

*Minion: Traitor (motivation: to betray people)*

Atsuko Popov is a fourth-generation gumo and has one of the two most obvious forms, which means that she has to stay out of sight. Since puberty, when she developed into a half-spider, she feels she has been forced to live in a prison of secrecy. She began researching ways to reproduce the bioweapon that originally created the gumo, unaware that a goddess’ interference (see Arachne on page 112) was the motivating factor. Her fixation on this idea eventually drove other gumo to avoid her. Working alone, she came up with a serum that she thought might work; unfortunately, her more human-seeming mother discovered her plans and in the resulting argument was injected. Atsuko’s mother died quickly, messily, and in agony as Atsuko watched. Atsuko is now determined to succeed as it is the only way, in her mind, that she can justify the increasing death toll. Soon after, she began deliberately experimenting on humans and dissecting gumo. Some of her first victims were the undocumented workers who built her lab.

Once she is aware of the plague, Atsuko will try to insinuate herself into the investigation by hacking her name onto the list of disease experts. She will contact authorities, or [[the hunters]] if they contact her, via video call (hiding her lower half). She’ll try to keep the investigation away from her lab by manufacturing a fake source for the plague. If someone she’s talking to is scientifically keen, she will try to exploit that for her own purposes. **Powers:**

-   **[[Many]] Legs**: Allows her to climb walls.

-   **Produce Webs**: If possible, she prefers she prefers not to contaminate her lab with these.

**Attacks:** **Syringe** 0-[[harm]] [[intimate]] sedative. **Handgun** 2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[loud]].

**[[Armour]]:** \*Unusual anatomy\* (makes vital points harder to find): 1-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** None. Although not fully human, she is still a mortal creature.

# The Lab

*Location: Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)*

![[image86.png]]Atsuko has set up a bare-bones lab underground. It is hidden in an unused [[area]] of sewer and subway tunnels. There are holding pens for her ‘guinea pigs.’ The lab has two entrances, one isolated from the other. The first is Atsuko’s regular way in and out. It is a stairwell leading up to an airlock door past which is a short corridor leading to a doorway leading into the basement of a private residence she purchased via agents. The corridor is quite wide (to accommodate her size) and the doorway is concealed as a wall of home improvement tools. The second entrance is connected to the holding pens and leads out into the tunnels. When an experiment goes wrong, she releases them this way. A [[close]] look will reveal the tools are so firmly secured that removing them would be inconvenient, as she didn’t want them falling off every time she opened the door. The house above the basement has several hidden cameras so she can see what is happening. The property is fenced in and she keeps several guard dogs on the premises.

The lab is serene and sterile. Atsuko makes sure there is minimal contamination between experiments. She stores the bodies of past experiments and other gumo to dissect later. In a medical walk-in cooler unit, a carefully labeled rack contains contains blood, tissue, and prototype serum samples.

# Arachnoids

*Minion: Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

Arachnoids are former human beings who have been changed by Atsuko into tortured, pain-wracked spider-human hybrids. They often return to their regular haunts and hunt familiar faces. Most will avoid hunting [[close]] friends and family. Some can pass for human, while others have obvious mutant spider features.

The mutation process is brutal, and they will die from the changes in about a week. **Powers:**

• **Spider-parts**: They can produce webs, and climb walls like a spider. **Attacks:** **Claw and bite** 4-[[harm]] hand/close [[messy]].

**[[Armour]]:** Choose: **Human skin**: 0-[[armour]], **Light chitin**: 1-[[armour]], or **[[Heavy]] chitin**: 2-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 9. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** No special weaknesses—although mutated, they are still normal living creatures.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**Webbing**: The arachnoids are capable of producing webs. **When an arachnoid tries to maneuver a hunter into its webs**, the hunter must roll +[[Cool]]:

On a 10 or more, they avoid being entangled in the webs and gain a +1 [[Forward]] against the arachnoid.

On a 7-9, they avoid the webbing but have to choose one of the following:

-   They are placed in a vulnerable position.

-   They lose something important.

-   The webs are between them and the arachnoid, blocking them from acting against the monster for the moment.

On a miss, they are entangled in webs and cannot move their arms or legs.

# The Unused Tunnels

*Location: Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

Depending on the city you use for the mystery, the tunnels might be sewers, subway lines, basements, catacombs, or the remnants of historical city structures.

The arachnoids that Atsuko released live in these tunnels when they’re not creeping about their old places. The deeper you go, the more web-filled and cluttered the tunnels become. Dead animals, people, and arachnoids will be found tangled up in webs.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**Web-Blocked Corridors**: When [[the hunters]] find a blocked tunnel, they might try to navigate it carefully or just cut their way through. If **they try to navigate the webs carefully**, they roll +[[Cool]]:

-   On a 10 or more, they find a path through the webs without alerting anything. Anyone following them has +1 [[forward]] to navigate the webbing.

-   On a 7-9, They get through but something goes wrong.

-   On a miss someone gets stuck and something is coming for you. If **they cut or burn through**, roll +[[Tough]]:

-   On a 10 or more, they open up a path for everyone to follow.

-   On a 7-9 they get through but something goes wrong.

-   On a miss, you make too much noise and now something is coming for you.

Some things that can go wrong (on 7-9 or miss results):

-   A piece of equipment is lost or broken.

-   A hunter is attacked.

-   Bad side effects of their approach (perhaps smoke or getting lost).

-   [[The hunters]] get lost or separated.

-   Arachnoids trap someone in a dead end.

# Arachne

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

![[image87.jpg]]Arachne was once human before she ascended to become the goddess of weaving and spiders. Modern myth has twisted the story to make it sound like a curse or punishment, but each god is given the privilege to create a single mortal species. This privilege can be fulfilled either by creating a species from nothing or by altering an existing species. Arachne chose to use her privilege to affect the bioweapon’s effect on humans, causing it to mutate them into something viable rather than painfully kill them.

Arachne is limited in how she can interact with mortals: she can only send dreams to [[the hunters]]. Hunters with [[The Sight]] might also notice spider spirits. A Divine, Chosen, Summoned, Expert, or similar hunter might see the influence of such an entity.
