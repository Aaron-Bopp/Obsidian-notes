802701 AD

*By Mark Tygart*

# Concept

[[The hunters]] are flung into the distant future of H.G. Wells’ *The Time Machine* and must find a way back to their own time.

This is a phenomena mystery based on the idea of a time portal.

# Hook

While investigating the new San Marcos Large Hadron Collider for signs of ‘lost time’ and reports of ghostly figures from the past, an experiment with ‘red matter’ goes disastrously wrong and transports [[the hunters]] to 802,701 A.D.

# Overview

[[The hunters]] must survive nightly attacks by hostile Morlocks, and may befriend the beautiful Eloi.

The Eloi will direct [[the hunters]] to the haunted ‘Green Porcelain Palace’, the ruins of a museum. At the museum, a ‘ghost’ (really a hologram curator) can explain that the Morlocks’ reactor can be set to explode and send the party back to their own time. The reactor is deep within the Morlock Caverns.

# Background Information

U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was a fan of the story and advised author H.G. Wells of his solution to the problem of a Morlock infestation: Shotguns!

The mystery is inspired by *The Time Machine*—both the book and the major Hollywood adaptations (the classic George Pal from 1960, and the less successful Simon Wells from 2002). In general, it follows the original Wells story (small goblin-like Morlocks, ‘flower children halfling’ Eloi, etc.) but the museum curator A.I. hologram was inspired by the 2002 movie. *The Big Bang Theory* first season episode homage (“The Nerdvana Annihilation”) should not be missed by *Time Machine* fans.

# Custom Moves

## In The Museum

When you **search for a useful item in the museum**, roll +Sharp:

On a 10+, you find such an item and understand its function. A solar-powered flashlight or miraculous first aid kit would be an example.

On a 7-9, you find the item but you have limited ability to use it or manipulate it due to its alien or futuristic nature. A possibility would be a talkative ray gun that refuses to be fired unless you can ethically justify the use of violence. Just as you discuss the ethical issues with the weapon, you are joined by a giant, curious prehistoric millipede!

On a miss, the item is not what you think it is… e.g. the argumentative ray gun turns out to be a children’s toy that can only fire harmless colored lights and bubbles.

## Overloading The Reactor

When you set the reactor to overload, [[the Keeper]] chooses some of these things to happen before it reaches the red line:

-   A Morlock horde attacks!

-   You need a tool or part that isn’t to be found here (but you saw one nearby).

-   A premature, unstable wormhole portal opens and brings something unexpected from a previous era: a bewildered Dimetrodon!

-   A blast of steam does 1-[[harm]] to a hunter.

-   A group of Eloi who have followed [[the hunters]] attempt to ‘help.’ • The treacherous leader of the Morlocks suddenly wants to ‘parley.’

-   The Morlock caverns begin to collapse.

*Monsters: Devourers (motivation: to consume people)*

After thousands of generations of living without sunlight, the Morlocks have dull grey-to-white skin, chinless faces, large greyish-red eyes with a capacity for reflecting light, and flaxen hair on the head and back. They are smaller than humans (the same height as Eloi). They are significantly weaker than an average human, but a large swarm of them is a serious threat to [[the hunters]], especially in the dark. Their sensitivity to light makes them reluctant to attack during the day. The Morlocks and the Eloi have something of a symbiotic relationship: the Eloi are clothed and fed by the Morlocks, and in return the Morlocks eat the Eloi. **Powers:**

-   **See in the dark**.

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image79.jpg" style="width:6in;height:2.64969in" />**Attacks:** **Capture** (see below), **Talons** 1-[[harm]] hand messy.

**Armour:** None.

**Harm Capacity:** 12 (Each point represents a single Morlock).

\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]

**Weakness:** Light—they will flee from any illumination.

**Custom [[Moves]]:**

**Capture**: **When you fight a Morlock horde in the dark**, the Morlocks always choose to do one of these:

-   Inflict their damage on you.

-   Capture you with their nets.

If you get captured, they take you (and your equipment) without further damage to the Morlock Larder.

# Time-lost Dimetrodon

*Minion: Brute (Motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

Early prehistoric carnivorous reptile. Think of it as a huge alligator with a fin on its back. **Powers:**

• **Ambush**: May attack before a victim can react.

**Attack:** **Bite** 3-[[harm]] hand messy. **Armour:** 1 (thick scales).

**Harm Capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image81.jpg" style="width:6in;height:2.64979in" />**Weakness:** Cold. They will quickly fall into a stupor in low temperatures and will not attack at night above ground.

# Time-lost Giant Prehistoric Millipede

*Minion: Cultist (motivation: to save its own skin at any cost)* Curious giant vegetarian millipede from the prehistoric past.

**Powers:**

• **Acid Blood Splash**: When harmed, the giant millipede splashes an attacker with acid blood (2-[[harm]] close acid messy).

**Attack:** **Bite** 1-[[harm]] hand.

**Armour:** 3 (thick carapace).

**Harm Capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** Fearful: Will flee from any attack or perceived threat. Generally will not bite unless molested.

# Green Porcelain Palace

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

The Palace of Green Porcelain was an ancient museum that has been long abandoned. The Time Traveler named it after the texture of the outer walls. Certain hallways lead down into the Morlock Caverns.

The museum is inhabited both by a helpful ‘ghost’ (a Museum Curator A.I.) and several curious and fearful giant prehistoric millipedes.

# White Sphinx

*Location: Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)*

The Morlock Sphinx is a [[structure]] on the surface of the Earth. Whoever built it, the Morlocks maintain the Sphinx. A sliding panel hides an entrance to the Morlock Caverns. The Morlocks can lock this door to trap explorers. The Eloi generally avoid the Sphinx (for obvious reasons).

# Morlock Caverns

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

A series of underground tunnels and passages connected by a series of wells (each with a ladder) to the surface and other structures left behind by humanity. These structures include the Palace of Green Porcelain and the White Sphinx. The caverns are normally totally dark, which is comfortable for the Morlocks. The caverns include a Morlock village and larder.

# Morlock Larder

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

The grisly cages and butcher’s shop where the Morlocks carefully tend their future meals (i.e., living Eloi).

The larder cages are relatively easy to escape from and the Morlocks will store the party’s equipment in the same room for examination. The Morlocks are used to the harmless Eloi, but might upgrade their security methods if [[the hunters]] escape or otherwise demonstrate their intelligence.

# The Eloi

*Bystanders: Victims (motivation: to put themselves in danger)*

The Eloi are smaller than modern humans, with shoulder-length curly hair, pointed chins, large eyes, small ears, small mouths with bright red thin lips, and sub-human intelligence. The Eloi speak a simple language, but have no interest in learning English or in anything besides simple play.

The Eloi do not work. As in the novel, they enjoy feeding, playing, and mating. When Weena falls into a river, none of the other Eloi will help her.

Periodically, the Morlocks capture individual Eloi for food. Because this typically happens on moonless nights, the Eloi are terrified of darkness. The Eloi–Morlock relationship developed from a class distinction present in our own time: the Morlocks are the working class who had to work underground so the rich upper class could live in luxury. With time, the balance of power changed—the surface people no longer dominating the underground dwellers but instead becoming their livestock.

Additionally, Eloi seem to have some form of low-grade telepathy.

# Weena, an Eloi

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

She is a typical Eloi of elfin beauty and puppy dog intellect, but retains genuine empathy and loyalty (unlike many other Eloi). Weena has a form of telepathy that may help [[the hunters]] in a crisis.

[[The hunters]] should be given every opportunity to save her from the river or the Morlocks. If rescued or otherwise impressed, Weena will proceed to aid [[the hunters]] to the best of her ability.

She knows the location of the Porcelain Palace (Museum) which the Eloi call “the place of ghosts,” and that the prehistoric millipedes are not harmful if treated gently. She also knows not to go outdoors at night.

# Eloi Compound

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image83.png" style="width:5.99667in;height:3.45667in" />In the future, the ‘proto-Eloi’ had achieved a true utopian society. Their advanced and subtly complex technology (maintained by the Morlocks) was practically invisible. The Eloi Compound reflects this—all the necessities of life either grow (such as delicious fruits) or appear as if by magic or as a smoothly integrated part of the vaguely classical architecture. A river flows near by the compound: this is where the group will encounter the drowning Weena.

"Einstein", Museum Curator A.I.

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

A hologram projected from a computer program hidden deep beneath the Earth. The A.I. has the personality of a friendly Hollywood version of Albert Einstein, who exists to deliver helpful information. The holographic program cannot physically aid the party. Its profound intellect can tell them how to defeat the Morlocks and return home (who wish to scavenge its mainframe and museum items for parts).
