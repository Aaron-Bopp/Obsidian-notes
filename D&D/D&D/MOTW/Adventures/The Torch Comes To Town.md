The Torch Comes To Town

*By Felix Girke*

# Concept

A clandestine cargo intended for the local cult chapter arrives at the port: a magical bottle. Within is an is an efreet—a malevolent, magical, wish-fulfilling fire spirit. When the efreet is inadvertently released, it brings a grave danger to the entire city.

# Hook

![[image152.png]]Through contacts in law enforcement or the media, [[the hunters]] learn that a few minutes ago a man was hacked to death in a disturbing and mysterious murder. Any hunter with a foresight-style ability (e.g. the move **hunches**) will feel this is an urgent matter.

The dead man is Errol Mauser, a customs agent. Just a few steps away from the entrance to the apartment building where he lived, he was cut down by assailants unknown and died on the spot. To boot, his face was eaten off, and not cleanly.

The cargo vessel Tillinghast [[Forward]] had arrived at the port a little earlier. Errol Mauser, on duty to inspect it for contraband, discovered the captain had been turned into a lichen-like monstrosity (the captain had wished he could live forever). Mauser stole the precious bottle he found by the stricken man. But the intended recipients of the bottle, members of the Scorched Ones, noticed him slipping away and caught up with him outside his house.

As CCTV footage footage of or witnesses to the killing reveal, the bottle falls during the struggle and its cap pops. Something hardly visible rushes out. The bottle is flung away and hovers in the air for a while.

The Efreet (a.k.a. The Black Torch/

# The Shadow Flame/The Dawn Maw)

*Monster: Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)*

A roiling angry mass of superhot black plasma, the efreet only takes on a vaguely humanoid shape when dealing with petitioners or victims. As likely to burn you to a cinder as to grant your wish (if the latter, then horribly perverted), the efreet has been bottled up for so long that it revels in its freedom and will only go back into his bottle if forced. Massive amounts of water deter and inconvenience the efreet—even if angry, it will not pursue across water.

The efreet is a primordial demonic being, innately hostile to humanity and all other life. In medieval times, it rampaged across the world until stopped by the powers of a Muslim sheikh, and ever since then it has been vulnerable to Islamic prayer.

**Powers:**

-   **Fulfill Wishes**: The efreet can grant wishes and will fulfill them in its own twisted way. E.g., turned into a lichen for “immortality,” aged 50 years instantly for “wisdom,” a global rain of peas for “peace on Earth,” hunted by the FBI and previous owners for “50 million dollars.”

-   **Swarm of Scarabs**: Swarms of flesh-eating scarabs manifest spontaneously where the efreet has been. See below for the details on these critters.

-   **Flight**.

-   **Barely There**: When the efreet is lurking or simply flying, it becomes nearly transparent. Its real shape is awesome and terrifying.

-   **Plasmic Body**: Impervious to [[weapons]] without the *blessed*, *magical*, or *silver* tags.

**Attacks:** **Scorching ray** 3-[[harm]] close/far area slow heat. **Whirlwind**: 2-[[harm]] area forceful (see **twister** move below).

**Armour:** 0, but refer to its **barely there** and **plasmic body** powers, above.

**Harm capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:**

**Islamic ritual:** The efreet was originally defeated and bound by a Muslim sheikh, so it fears the religion of Allah and will flee from its holy people and their prayers.

**Custom [[Moves]]:**

**Twister**: **The first time you are hit by the efreet’s whirlwind attack**, you are surprised. Disregard the usual weapon effect and roll +Tough:

-   On a 10+, you grit your teeth and stand your ground (but your hair is a mess).

-   On a 7-9, you are thrown, like, 20 feet. You take 2-[[harm]] and get –1 [[forward]].

-   On a miss, you are swept up and unceremoniously dropped a block or two away. You take 4-[[harm]] and are away from the action.

**Return to the Bottle**: The efreet cannot attack somebody holding the bottle or the cap. It may also be trapped back in the bottle by a **big magic** ritual.

Requirements for the evil ritual are:

-   The bottle and cap.

-   A few ounces of molten silver to seal it.

-   A group of at least three people chanting a song in the language of djinns, while one person dances with two torches under the open sky (see the custom move **dances with djinns**, below).

-   The bloody sacrifice of a large mammal—ideally a camel, but a horse, giraffe, or even a human would do.

**Dances with Djinns**: If you **dance with two torches to mesmerize a nearby efreet**, roll +Charm:

-   On a 10+, the efreet will come quickly and return into the bottle providing the rest of the ritual requirements are met. Choose one consequence from the list below.

-   On a 7-9, the efreet will take its time and return into the bottle unwillingly. Choose two consequences.

-   On a miss, the efreet is insulted and enraged by the performance and attacks the dancing hunter. [[The Keeper]] chooses two consequences.

On any hit, the dancing hunter decides which ritual-participant the consequence is applied to (including themselves). The list of consequences are:

-   One hunter’s face is scarred forever. Change their look accordingly, and take 2-[[harm]].

-   One hunter is burned. Take 2-[[harm]] and permanently lose one box from the health track.

-   One hunter is cursed. Delete one improvement option from the playbook.

-   One hunter is enchanted. Their eyes are now literally burning.

-   One hunter gains pyrophobia. In future, they will need to **act under pressure** to go near open flames.

-   One hunter is touched by the supernatural. If possible, their next improvement must either be “Take +1 Weird” or a move that requires rolling +Weird.

# Swarm of Flesh-eating Scarabs

*Minion/Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)* A slow but voracious swarm of scarab beetles. **Powers:**

-   **Hide Inside Dead Bodies**.

-   **Flight**.

-   **Obscure Vision**.

-   **Immune to [[Harm]]**, unless it is an *area*, *fire*, or *crushing* attack. **Attacks:** **Hundreds of mandibles** 1-[[harm]] intimate slow.

**Harm capacity:** 3. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> That’s enough to disperse the swarm so it’s no longer dangerous.

**Weakness:** Fire.

# Cultists of the Scorched Ones

*Minion/Scout (motivation: stalk, watch, and report)*

Cunning agents of the cult ready to sacrifice themselves to further its goals.

**Powers:**

• **Minor Spells**: Anything a normal **use magic** could do. **Weaknesses:** None (they are just normal humans).

**Attacks:** as per weapon, usually a **knife** 2-[[harm]] hand. **Armour:** none, but impervious to heat, smoke, fire.

**Harm capacity:** 6. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Sailors' Hostel

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

Full of sailors from all over the world, this is where the assassins first flee to. The sailors have heard stories about the cult, although they may not take them seriously.

# Police Precinct

*Location: Fortress (motivation: to deny entry)*

It will not be easy to get at the bottle once it’s here. There are usually two dozen police in the building.

# Sylvia Gailey, Police Lieutenant

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

Highly skilled, but has never been up against the supernatural.

# Cult Temple

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

If cultists get the bottle or cap, they will try to stash them in their hidden and mysterious stronghold. The two factions of cultists will eventually struggle over control of this site.

# Priscilla Oakley, homeless person

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)* She just wanted more gold than she could carry.
