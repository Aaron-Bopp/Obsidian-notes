Orbital Funk Princess

*By Jamie Sands*

*“OMG Orbital Funk Princess is the best game ever... EVER!!”*

# Overview

A vengeful fairy, angry over a real or imagined slight, has infiltrated the world, [[learned]] technology, and created the most addictive video game ever. He has targeted one town to start things off.

The game—*Orbital Funk Princess*—is so compelling that once someone picks it up, they must keep playing it. They keep playing the game to the exclusion of eating, drinking, or taking care of themselves at all. The game causes them to kill themselves through exhaustion, starvation, and related conditions such as thrombosis.

The game *Orbital Funk Princess* is present at each scene of death, in some instances still playing on the TV. If a hunter touches the physical game disc, sees it on-screen, or sees someone playing it, then they must test against the game’s move (see below). On a miss, they get ‘infected’ with a need to play the game. It’s not all-consuming—they can function and think about other things—but the need to play is like a hunger they can’t ignore forever. As time progresses, they will think about the game more and more.

# Hook

Potential leads:

-   People have been turning up dead from starvation/thrombosis/ etc while playing *Orbital Funk Princess*. There are reports on local news networks for the town and online news sources.

-   A hunter’s connection was raving about *Orbital Funk Princess*:

“Hey, isn’t that the game that was in the news because someone played it until they died?”

-   A hunter’s relative has been in contact, concerned about a cousin they [[haven]]’t heard from in a while. The last they heard from the cousin, they were excited about a new video game.

# Gaibriel

*Minion: Renfield (motivation: to drive victims to the game)*

Gaibriel is a tech-savvy fairy who’s angry with humanity. His vendetta began when he tried to entice some modern children away into the forest but they were too busy playing *Pokemon Go* to follow him. He’s decided to use the power of video games against humankind to get his revenge.

He is unwilling to stop his plan or give [[the hunters]] any information at all, but he isn’t a very [[Tough]] fae and not much of a fighter. He’s a trickster, hence his roundabout approach. If trapped and threatened, he will break the spell but he’ll try to mess with [[the hunters]] when he does it (e.g. insisting that the counter spell involves all [[the hunters]] skipping in a circle holding hands and singing, and covering them with indelible glitter. Harmless but annoying.)

He has no official course of distribution but has been planting the games in secondhand sales at game shops, leaving them in public libraries, and selling them at a stall in a rundown flea market along with other bric-a-brac.

He was not present at any of the death scenes as he relies on the random distribution of the games.

# Orbital Funk Princess, cursed game

*Phenomena: Panic (motivation: to make people act irrationally)*

It’s a game disc. It plays in any console, DVD player, or Blu-ray reader.

Gameplay is a straightforward first-person shooter. The animation is pretty with lots of vibrant colours and flashing lights. Galactic space scenes are frequent with classic funk playing as background music. It’s *very* absorbing.

**Weaknesses:**

The game’s curse can be cured by breaking the disc. However, the disc is magically protected: either the protective spell must be broken first, or an enchanted or [[holy]] weapon can break the disc and spell in one hit.

Gaibriel can be fought; he’s physically weak, although his [[magic]] and knowledge of tech is strong. If he can be defeated, he can be made to break the spell entrancing the workers in the factory, which will stop the manufacture of the games.

**Custom Move:**

If **you touch the game disc or see someone else playing it**, roll + [[Cool]]. You get +1 on the roll if you are watching someone else play, but -1 if you play it yourself.

-   On a 10+, it seems like a fun game—something is really neat about the music and images though you can’t describe what exactly.

-   On a 7-9, you feel a distinct urge to play more. Mark experience if you play *Orbital Funk Princess* when you should be helping the others with the investigation.

-   On a miss, you are compelled to play. You must **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to either stop playing, or if you have stopped playing, not pick up the game again.

[[Bystanders]] who see someone playing the game just get the urge to play. If they’re left alone they will play until they eventually die.
