Razorback

*By Arturo Martinez*

# Concept

Roughly two decades ago, a worker was fired from a pork processing plant. Filled with anger, he wore a pig mask and committed a series of murders. This resulted in the factory closing down. Rather than face justice, he (now calling himself “Razorback”) vowed to “come back from hell and finish what he started” as he dragged several hostages into a roaring meat grinder and followed them in.

# Hook

The Clemonte family, who own the plant, received notice from the local police that the pig-skin mask (which somehow survived the trip through the grinder) has gone missing from police archives. Cyril Clemonte has also gone missing.

# Razorback

*Monster: Executioner (motivation: to punish the guilty)*

Razorback is a huge ogre wearing a patchwork leather pig mask and a slaughterhouse apron full of killing tools. Magically [[Sensitive]] hunters notice an intense demonic aura. Everyone hears an intense buzzing of flies when he is near.

During combat, Razorback prefers to hang back and throw blades or spikes, or trigger machinery. Razorback does not run.

Slaughterhouse tools deal +2 [[harm]] to Razorback.

**Attacks:** **Thrown sharps** 2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[forceful]] [[messy]]. **Slaughterhouse hammer** 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]] stun. **Machinery** 5-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[messy]] [[slow]]. **Devour** 4-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[messy]] [[life-drain]]. **[[Armour]]:** 1

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 20. \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\] **Weakness:** Being ground up in the slaughterhouse machinery.

# The Pig Killing Factory

*Location: Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)*

The plant is full of dangling ceiling hooks on conveyors, and hoppers for grinding and destruction of pigs.

Razorback can activate them, and has built traps to maim, [[hold]], and kill his victims.

The remains of earlier victims can be found being eaten by slaughterhouse pigs.

**Attacks:** **Killing machines**: 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[messy]] [[loud]].

# Slaughterhouse Pigs

*[[Minions]]: Beasts (motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

Slaughterhouse pigs with oddly human-looking eyes are mysteriously appearing despite the plant being closed for years. They aren’t violent—they are scavengers—but will defend themselves if attacked. Slaughterhouse tools brandished threateningly will keep a mob of pigs from attacking.

If [[many]] are present, they will initiate an attack on a solitary or wounded hunter.

**Attacks:** **Pig bite** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[messy]]. **[[Harm]] capacity:** 3. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Archie Clemonte

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

Patriarch of the Clemonte family and owner of the family fortune. A former workaholic, a perfectionist, and a humourless bitter man who resents his family waiting for him to die. With his wife Penelope, he has a trio of children named Zachary, Sophia, and Cyril.

# Penelope Clemonte

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)*

Archie’s wife of 52 years. She was once a member of a witches’ coven that met secretly in the woods outside of town. She believes part of the success of the business is due to her [[magic]] dealings.

# Zachary Clemonte

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

An heir of the Clemonte family, he is a martial artist, a yuppie, and a bully. He often quotes Sun Tzu when trying to impress new people he meets, plus he has a collection of oil paintings of himself in dramatic karate poses throughout his workplace.

# Sophia Clemonte

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)*

An heir of the Clemonte family, she liked to explore the mansion as a child. She stumbled across magical items in secret rooms, and she may offer these to [[the hunters]] in exchange for help. She entertains parapsychology as a hobby when she isn’t administrating side ventures of the family fortune.

# Cyril Clemonte

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

An heir of the Clemonte family, he is the youngest of the three siblings and an introvert. Cyril is soft spoken and often bullied, but knows more about his mother’s occult dealings than his father or his siblings. He has a stash of occult books he has been studying in secret and is barely hiding his excitement of discovering real (and frightening) [[magic]].

# The Clemonte Mansion

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

Haunted and full of clues as to the nature of Razorback and his apparent resurgence. Local rumours say the family once dabbled in old world lore, and that the evidence is hidden in sealed-off rooms.
