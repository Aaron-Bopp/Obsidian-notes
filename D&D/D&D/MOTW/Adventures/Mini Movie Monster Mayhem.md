Monster Mayhem

*By Zed Lopez*

# Concept

Ephraim Larson, Helena Lee, and their ten-year-old daughter Miri were a happy family until Helena was diagnosed with terminal cancer.

She seemed fine until she collapsed three days ago. At the hospital, tests proved the worst: osteosarcoma had metastasized to her lungs, kidneys, and brain.

Ephraim and Miri are monster movie fans; Helena is a biomedical researcher. Helena explained to Miri that the cancer was like a monster inside her, drinking her blood so it could grow.

Miri heard Ephraim, Helena, and a doctor discussing hospice care. So yesterday Miri began doing something she’d been forbidden since she was 3. She’s a biokinetic, capable of transmuting flesh. It came to light during an unfortunate incident with the family cat: Miri thought she’d rather have a dog. Her parents insisted she must never do it again. Helena wouldn’t even let it be spoken of and preferred to pretend it had never happened.

While Helena slept and Ephraim was out of the room, Miri has been envisioning pushing the [[monsters]] out of her mother, and it’s been working. They emerge as miniatures of whatever movie monster Miri had been picturing, a few inches high. After Miri severed the connection, each scurried from the room. The process leaves Miri spent: she can only do it every few hours. Miri didn’t think much about what happened to the [[monsters]] next; she had bigger things to worry about and she assumed they’d soon perish outside of a host body. But she guessed wrong... they can live and grow, but crave and need blood. They absolutely will not [[harm]] Miri or Helena, but everyone else is fair game.

# Notes

The most challenging part of the investigation will probably be connecting the [[monsters]] to Miri or Helena so that the story can come out. Some ways that might happen: enhanced senses (a Monstrous [[shapeshifter]] ability or one of **[[Use Magic]]**’s “things beyond human capability”) might lead someone tracking a monster by smell bacl to Helena. A moment of magic sensitivity might detect Miri, who’s something like a Spooky hunter. If [[the hunters]] meticulously map all the sites of attacks, tell them their exact epicenter is Helena’s room. They might meet Miri, who isn’t spending all of her time with her mother, and is sometimes sent out of the room so her parents can talk. [[The hunters]] might see a monster run by her, noting both that it’s declining to attack her and that she doesn’t seem alarmed or surprised by it. **Using magic** to view another time or place might let [[the hunters]] backtrack to Helena’s room.

For bookkeeping, have a card for each monster that includes their current height and [[harm]] and whether they’re active, or torpid and hiding. Prepare a stack of small cards for victims. As time passes and torpid [[monsters]] go active, add height to the monster and increase the [[harm]] of its attacks. When off-screen attacks occur, stack another victim card by the monster’s card, noting when and where the attack happened and the size of the monster at the time so you can keep everyone’s stories straight.

# Possible Events

-   Nurse Jill Verne, wanting to do something nice for Miri, gets Miri’s parents’ permission to take her to the pediatric ward’s Halloween party, where a monster attacks and [[the hunters]] have the chance to make it to the scene. Miri realizes what’s happening.

-   Mickey Kovac, a 9-year-old in a Frankenstein costume, took advantage of the chaos in the pediatric wing to slip out and explore. [[The hunters]] see him in the distance somewhere dimly lit where obviously no child would be.

-   One or more [[monsters]] find the blood bank. A potential boss fight at the climax could come after someone finds a seven-foot miniKing Kong passed out in the room and runs screaming.

# Inspiration

A girl transforming cancer into creatures is inspired by Tina Shaw from

*Progenitor*, Greg Stolze’s gonzo alternate [[history]] supplement for *Wild Talents*. The Shavians she creates are very different.

# Mini Movie Monsters

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume people, blood in particular)*

Start with the Universal [[monsters]]—Dracula, the Wolf Man, Frankenstein’s monster, the Mummy—but use whatever you like that an

11-year-old might be thinking of.... King Kong, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, a Triffid, the Blob, a Gremlin, Mothra, Godzilla, a zombie, the Bride of Frankenstein, a miniature giant ant, or a tiny 50-foot woman.

They don’t have the traditional vulnerabilities or supernatural abilities of the [[monsters]] they resemble: they’re still cancer, just independent and mobile. But they do have whatever abilities their shapes imply—[[flight]] if they have wings, attacks with horns or tails if they have them, and so on. They’re unintelligent but canny predators; think shark or crocodile. They have a vague inclination to mimic the habits of their inspirations. Dracula will avoid sunlight and ‘sleep’ in a box; the Wolf Man is drawn to any forest or park that might be near the hospital; the Blob avoids cold.

At first, they won’t stray too far from Helena (and thus the hospital). But the bigger they get, the weaker that pull is.

**Powers:**

-   **Feeding and Growth**: The [[monsters]] start out very fast, doing 0-[[harm]] scratches or nips for drops of blood and zipping away. After feeding on any amount of blood, they find a hiding place because they become torpid as they grow. Their growth is unrelated to how much blood they consumed. By the time they’re one foot tall, every time they [[feed]], they grow another foot in about four hours. As they grow, they slow down, becoming comparable to a fast human of similar size.

-   **Respawn**: If a monster takes full [[harm]] but isn’t defeated with a weakness, it becomes inert and seems dead. However, within hours, another tiny monster will spawn from the the body. This can happen from even the smallest part (Keeper’s choice whether a body left in pieces generates multiple copies).

**Attacks:** The attacks all use the monster’s size in feet to determine [[harm]] amounts. **Bite** Size-[[harm]] intimate. **Claw** (Size minus 1)-[[harm]] hand.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** Equal to their height in feet (minimum 1). So a three-foot monster can withstand 3-[[harm]], and can bite for 3-[[harm]] or claw for 2-[[harm]].

**Weakness:**

**Disease Cures:** Radiation, chemotherapy drugs, other harsh chemicals (e.g. concentrated acid, bleach, or ammonia), or magic. In particular, a successful use of **[[Use Magic]]** to ‘cure a disease’ will kill a monster of any size outright.

# The Hospital

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

The hospital has a cancer treatment center. Within the hospital, there will be other areas that count as specific [[locations]]. Use the ideas below or your own, based on what feels fun (don’t worry too much about getting things exactly right).

The pharmacy (where chemotherapy drugs could be found) is a **Fortress** (motivation: to deny entry).

The nursery is likely a **Fortress** (motivation: to deny entry) to protect the newborn babies.

Radiotherapy treatment rooms (where the linacs—linear accelerators—are), and the Radiology department (with X-ray machines) have restricted access. If you’re not using a specific hospital in [[the hunters]]’ city, it is an old hospital being modernized, and has a floor (or more) closed for remodelling. A basement full of outdated and disused equipment can be a **Maze**.

Other interesting places hospitals might have: a cafeteria, and thus a kitchen; an ICU; an emergency department; a physical therapy center (thus much of the equipment of a small gym); a psychiatric ward; a morgue (which may serve the county or other local jurisdiction, or may just be temporary storage until a body can be moved); an incinerator (where medical waste awaiting incineration could include amputated limbs); locker rooms; an on-call room with exhausted residents napping in bunk beds; a dialysis center; operating rooms; a loading dock, near which non-perishable medical supplies are stored; multiple large janitorial closets (where bleach could be gotten much more easily than chemo drugs). Any number of these could be **Dens**. Dracula would have one, but many [[monsters]] would be indifferent about returning to the same place to hide.

# Helena Lee

*Bystander: Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Rational, meticulous, and organized, used to being in control. If she were honest with herself, which she hasn’t been, what upset her most about what happened when Miri was three was the violence to her worldview, not to their cat. She is struggling to hide that she’s terrified of dying.

# Ephraim Lee

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

He works in Human Resources for a bank. He’s normally relaxed and casual, quick with a joke. At home, he’s used to being the fun parent who suggests going out for ice cream. He’s terrified that Helena’s death will leave him too wrecked to be there for Miri the way he wants to.

# Miri Lee

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

She’s a bright and curious ten-year-old girl, quick to grasp the things that grown-ups try to obscure, like that her mother had nothing left to lose. Her memories of what happened with the cat when she was three aren’t clear. She desperately wants to save her mother, but she’s also excited to finally find out some of what she can do.

# Shirley Landau

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

The hospital’s director of security. She’s a stout woman in a scratchy-looking suit who runs a tight ship. She’s never without a clipboard. She has seen the hospital through local disasters, power outages, and a quarantine. This is just one more crisis: she’ll make a plan and get through it like she always does.

# Ivan Lowenstein

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

One of Landau’s security guards. Ivan is a big man who loves to talk and never knows what he thinks until he hears himself saying it out loud. He’d be happy to pass on rumors or invent new ones on the spot.

# Sergeant Sara Robinson

*Bystander: Detective (motivation: to rule out explanations)*

One of the pair of cops first on the scene. Robinson is one of the youngest sergeants ever in her department. When something doesn’t make sense, she won’t stop asking questions. She is not easily snowed.

# Davis Pham

*Bystander: Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)*

Robinson’s partner. He’s a gifted athlete and comfortable with the idea that in their partnership, she’s the thinker and he’s the doer. Evidence and theories? That’s Sara’s thing. Chasing suspects? That he understands.

# Adam Santiago

*Bystander: Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)*

Head nurse in the oncology ward. As such, he believes it’s his obligation to know everyone and everything in “his” ward. He takes his obligation seriously.

# Alice Kwong

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

The oncologist in charge of Helena’s care. She was once a religious woman, but being so close to so much pain and death has broken her faith. What she sees in Helena’s latest lab results seems almost… miraculous.
