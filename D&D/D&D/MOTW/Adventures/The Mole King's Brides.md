The Mole King's Brides

*By Aaron Burkett*

*Ualichu’s Proclamation was created by Daniel Fowler*

# Concept

Yudashkin is a leshii who wishes to see the world, but cannot stray too [[far]] from trees native to his home in Russia. A travelling businessman, has brought seeds to a forest park where Yudashkin has a second home now. However, this angered the local forest powers, and Ualichu the mole king has trapped Yudashkin within those woods. The mystery begins as Yudashkin puts his plan to escape into action.

# Hook

A group of teenagers camping in a state park came across a vagrant

(Yudashkin) who spoke with a Russian accent. He enticed Lindsay with a handful of golden pine cones. Lindsay and the man turned into a flock of blackbirds and flew away. Dismissing the bird transformations as a drug side effect, local authorities are now searching for Lindsay.

Investigators know the state park is a weirdness magnet and has been since humanity first came here. The mountain itself has been the center of native legends and New Age beliefs.

# Ivanovich the vagrant, aka Yudashkin the Leshii

*Monster: Tempter (motivation: to draw others into evil deeds)*

A spirit of dark Russian forests, Yudashkin longed to see the rest of the world. A human ally planted the first seeds of Yudashkin’s trees in the

1990s. Yudashkin’s presence disrupted the power balance in the forest between the goblin market and the Low Court and they trapped him within the borders of the park. To buy off this punishment, Yudashkin will offer Lindsay to Ualichu, the local fey lord, at the upcoming Solstice or Equinox.

In his natural form, Yudashkin is a tree of flesh and fronds composed of human and tree limbs.

**Powers:**

-   **[[Shapeshifter]]**: He can appear as an elderly man, a boar, or a flock of blackbirds.

-   **Tree Stride**: Yudashkin travels through the space surrounding any of his trees as if they were side by side. They’re located across the park so he can suddenly appear and menace [[the hunters]] whenever it’s appropriate.

-   **Grant Magical Power**: He may gift a human with a magical ability. These gifts are wild and always strike back at their user in cruel ways.

-   **Trapped**: As the mystery begins, he is magically imprisoned within this specific forest park.

**Attacks:** **Primordial curse** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[area]] [[magic]] transform (-1 [[forward]] to run away; if not magically cured, the curse eventually turns you into a tree.) **[[Armour]]:** **Fallen pine needles and rotten flesh**: 2-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 14. \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]

**Weaknesses:**

**Home Forest:** He must maintain proximity to trees from his native forest. Destroying these trees in the park will banish him back to Russia.

**His Name:** Yudashkin hates the sound of his name. If you name him in his presence, roll + [[Weird]]:

-   On a 10+ choose two.

-   On a 7-9 choose one.

-   On a miss, you make him very angry. Naming the leshii options:

-   Force him into the form of a woodland creature.

-   Call down the fury of nature: deal his [[harm]] back to him.

-   Provide +1 [[armour]] to yourself or someone else.

-   Declare Yudashkin’s [[Vulnerability]] (fire, silver, cold iron, etc.) Any further damage from that source deals +1 [[harm]] and pierces [[armour]].

# The Park

*Location: Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

Located east of the local interstate, the park is mostly rocky coniferous forests overshadowed by Mount Taima at its heart. The search for Lindsay is focused around the Tangakwunu Valley Campgrounds.

The valley trailhead is the highest point accessible by car terminating at the trailhead at 7,000 feet. The panoramic view encompasses Mount Taima to the east, Lake Mansi and the Litonya River to the northwest, Tatanka Mountains to the south, with the mountains on the horizon.

The Tangakwunu Valley Campgrounds are located on the western side of the highway, at the very end of the road.

# The Leshii's Grove

*Location: Fortress (motivation: to keep intruders out)*

A tightly woven stand of fir, juniper, and pines which fight against intruders with undead hands (1-[[harm]], reduces [[armour]] by 1.) The central grove is located on a butte that drops off into Lake Mansi.

# The Groundskeepers, Park Ranger Cult

*Minion: Renfield (motivation: to push victims toward the monster)*

The park rangers have formed a druidic-style cult around Yudashkin, who they call “the Old Master.” They plant his saplings and he grants them command over the park’s wild animals.

Park Ranger Rodney Womack is the self-appointed leader. A sprig of juniper is pinned to his shirt. **Powers:**

• **Beastspeak**: When a groundskeeper is attacked or spied upon, the beasts of the park warn and intervene to protect him/her.

**Attacks:** **Deer rifle** 2-[[harm]] [[far]] [[loud]]. **Ritual knife** 1-[[harm]] [[close]]. **[[Armour]]:** None.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Taylor Shaw

*Minion: Traitor (motivation: to betray people)*

Lindsay’s boyfriend, who now has an agreement with Ivanovich: he brings kids out camping for Ivanovich and in exchange he gets “[[Cool]]” [[magic]] powers. They aren’t much right now, but the birds in his dreams tell him they’re just the down payment. His voice is charming, all the time.

Little does he realise, the powers will soon be too much for his body.

He’ll be reduced to a lost spirit, seducing others into self-destruction.

# ![[image135.png]]Ualichu, the Mole King

*Minion: [[Guardian]] (motivation: to bar the way or protect his wives)*

Ualichu dwells in the Hidden City, attended by his Eyeless Brides. He rules over the primal direction Down. Wearing a cloak of human eyes and attended by giant mummies, Ualichu is a terrifying power of the Earth. With shining teeth and blackest flesh, his very presence is the weight of all the stone above and the absence of light.

**Powers:**

**Proclamation**: His word is Truth in a cosmic sense. What he says goes, literally. When you confront Ualichu with evidence of a broken proclamation, roll +[[Sharp]]. On any hit, the law-breaker is gravely weakened. On a 10+, the law-breaker is magically compelled to do one service for [[The Wronged]] party: they may not avoid or delay this penalty without painful (or even deadly) consequence.

# Lindsay Awale

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)* Currently held by Yudashkin (for her gorgeous eyes).

# Amber Canfield

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Lindsay’s best friend, who procured the drugs they were tripping on when the vagrant appeared. She got them from some guy named FlimFlam at the tent city.

# Wanekia

*Bystander: Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)*

This ancient giant leans on a crutch of petrified wood, her left leg atrophied.

The leshii’s grove squats on her favourite butte, and her territorial dispute with Yudashkin traps him inside the park’s official territory.

She now overlooks the Tangakwunu Valley Campgrounds from an escarpment to the south.

# Jose Gongorra, non-cultist Park Ranger

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

A friendly Park Ranger, organizing the search at the start of the mystery. He understands it’s dangerous to have such a large vagrant population in the park, but times are hard and these folks have nowhere else to go.

He tends to be a soft touch for them.

# Flim-Flam the Boggart

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

He and his crew keep up appearances with Ranger Gongorra and the vagrants’ campsite, while making sure everyone follows the rules. He opposes Ualichu, the Mole King, because of a grave slight in the past. Flim-Flam possesses the Invisible [[Hand]], a relic that creates goblin markets overlooked by mortal eyes.

# The Goblin Market

*Location: Crossroads (to bring people and things together)*

A fey bazaar where you can get your heart’s true desire. Also happens to be a vagrant tent city. You can find the Market in an isolated cleft, on the banks of the Litonya River.

# The Hidden City

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbor [[monsters]])*

Hosts the Low Court of Ualichu and is home to giant mummies. It lies under Mount Taima, the large mountain to the east.
