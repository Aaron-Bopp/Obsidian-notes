Elvis Has Left the Building

*By Mark Tygart*

*“In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.”*

—Franklin Delano Roosevelt

# Concept

![[image114.png]]The hunters investigate several bizarre appearances of the famously deceased Elvis Presley socializing with also-deceased ex-President Richard Nixon in their local community.

Almost everyone regards this case as a joke: typical of the silly tabloid ghost hunting stories that the *In Search of the Supernatural* television series is famous for producing. However, it offers [[the hunters]] the possibility of some [[quick]] money for very little work.

# Overview

‘Presley’ and ‘Nixon’ are actually tulpas created by Amy Caulfield—a ‘tulpamancer’ and con woman—who hopes to use her creation to get some money for an interview with her creations.

The problem is that Amy’s subconscious has created a “Rabbit of

Caerbannog” tulpa from her memories of *Monty Python and the [[Holy]]*

*Grail*. This new tulpa will begin by murdering Nixon, then Elvis, and finally Amy herself before it disappears back into non-existence.

# Hook

Potential leads:

-   The popular cable television tabloid series *In Search of the Supernatural* asks [[the hunters]] for their “expert consultants’ opinion” on the case.

-   ![[image115.png]]A Flake (or other conspiracy theorist hunter) hears about the phenomenon.

-   [[The hunters]] happen to be at the bar when the tulpas first appear.

-   A Snoop is called anonymously (by Amy) to join the interviewers (for a fee, of course).

# Investigation Notes

-   Nobody on the *In Search of the Supernatural* staff thinks the story is real, but the producers want [[the hunters]] to unearth an entertaining yarn they can broadcast. The worse [[the hunters]]’ reputations, the happier the producers are to hire them (for less money).

-   The tulpas only appear at the White House Bar at midnight when Amy Caulfield is present. Nixon asks for a large amount of money in exchange for interviews. However, tulpas cannot be recorded by electronic devices. The tulpas have only limited information about their historical selves: they only know what Amy knows. The tulpas always vanish by 1 a.m.

-   The tulpa is a concept in mysticism and the paranormal of a being or object that is willed into existence through spiritual or mental powers. It was adapted by 20th century theosophists from Tibetan religious practices. Modern practitioners use the term to refer to a type of willed imaginary friend which practitioners consider to be sentient and relatively autonomous. The concept of the tulpa was popularized in the Western world through fiction, gaining prominence in the late 1990s and 2000s.

-   Since 2009, anonymous posters on the discussion board 4chan started experimenting with creating tulpas, and the community gained popularity through the emergence of the *My Little Pony: Friendship Is [[Magic]]* fandom. The fans attempted to use meditation and lucid dreaming techniques to create imaginary friends. These individuals, calling themselves ‘tulpamancers,’ treat the tulpas as a

‘real or somewhat-real person.’ Due to this unlikely connection, some *My Little Pony* websites provide [[useful]] and accurate information about tulpas when [[the hunters]] investigate on the Web.

# Amy Caulfield, grifter and tulpamancer

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put herself in danger)*

An imaginative unemployed middle school English teacher, and single mother who decided to support her two daughters and make her way in the world by running supernatural short cons. Amy’s strong psychic abilities are largely subconscious but she can consciously summon tulpas after a few drinks (although she can’t fully control them).

If there’s a fight or other stressful situation in the bar, Amy might create more tulpas unintentionally. These could be any characters from fiction or [[history]] that would make the situation more chaotic or silly (that’s for you [[the Keeper]], it’s not what Amy wants). These tulpas will not be under her control, but may try to protect her from what is going on.

# Tulpas

*Minion: Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)*

A tulpa is an imaginary minion brought to life through pure will, lasting for a single hour. It is usually based on a fictional creation or historical figure with whom the creator has a strong emotional connection.

Normal tulpas only have the abilities of the person who created them. They doesn’t have any special powers, attacks, or [[armour]]. They only possess the knowledge and abilities of their creator. They may be destroyed by [[magic]] and will fade back into the subconscious of their creator within an hour of their creation. If killed, a tulpa’s corpse will fade from existence within an hour.

An evil tulpa will not fade after an hour. It will continue to manifest randomly (at [[the Keeper]]’s discretion) to [[harm]] its creator in some way. Tulpas always manifest an item an that can take advantage of their weakness. Tulpas of any type will always disappear if their creator dies.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

To **summon a tulpa** you must be able to use some sort of [[magic]] and have studied the process. A hunter trying it may have to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to stay focused while visualizing the tulpa. Roll +[[Weird]]:

-   On a 10+, a tulpa appears, totally under your control.

-   On a 7-9, a tulpa appears, mostly under your control.

-   On a miss, something bad appears, e.g. a tulpa that the hunter fears, a tulpa that hates the hunter, some other terrible entity.

# Richard Milhous Nixon, tulpa

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger).*

An imaginary friend brought to life, this version of Richard Nixon looks how he did when he inhabited the White House but only has the knowledge about his life that is available from a Wikipedia entry. This is the comedic, somewhat lovable, drunk, kooky chief executive of popular culture rather than the deeply troubled and brilliant former president. Conversations will always somehow arrive at requests for money in exchange for an interview and whether David Frost might be available. Amy is fond of the Ron Howard film *Frost/Nixon* and sometimes Nixon will briefly blur to resemble the actor Frank Langella for a few seconds. Sometimes, Nixon will bellow out for Henry Kissinger and the former Secretary of State may appear briefly in a mirror or in the corner of the hunter’s eye, looking as he did in the 70s.

# Elvis Aaron Presley, tulpa

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

This is the Las Vegas Elvis of popular lore in full regalia, but he is a carefree and warm hypocritical “King of Rock and Roll.” He voices his love for Monty Python, and his loathing of the scourge of illegal drugs (often while injecting himself or popping pills endlessly without effect). He often hugs President Nixon and treats him like a younger sibling, much to the former President’s discomfort. Unlike Nixon, Elvis seems to have some understanding that he is a tulpa, although he will not admit it. If killed, he will ask [[the hunters]] to have “Amy bring him and the former president back for a drink sometime,” as his dying wish.

# Rabbit of Caerbannog, evil deviant tulpa

*Monster: Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify)*

This unpredictable ‘bunny’ may look cute and cuddly on the outside, but inside it is a monstrous killing machine. The rabbit is cunning and targets the vital parts of its victim’s body to make a fast kill. Its mouth is full of razor-[[Sharp]] teeth, like a big cat. It is surprisingly swift, violent, agile, deadly, aggressive, bloodthirsty, and carnivorous.

When attacking multiple foes, the rabbit quickly jumps from one target to another, giving those it’s fighting no chance to stop it. **Powers:**

-   **Extremely fast and long jump**: After it inflicts [[harm]] on a target, it may instantly jump up to [[far]] range (including to another target).

**Attack:** **Bite** 5-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]].

**[[Armour]]:** 0. Soft fur, often bloody.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 5. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:**

-   **[[Holy]] [[Hand]] Grenade of Antioch**. The [[Holy]] [[Hand]] Grenade will appear randomly in the bar whenever the monster appears. It looks like a jewelled orb with a crucifix on top, and definitely looks out of place in the bar. The ‘grenade’ does 30-[[harm]] but only to rabbits and scenery.

-   The death of Amy Caulfield.

# White House Bar & Grill

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

A White House themed restaurant and bar in Southern California that would make a wonderful Disneyland attraction. Kitschy, but the steaks are excellent and the ‘Oval Office’ bar is the best in the community.

# David Dalton, Unemployed Actor

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

A talented, friendly, middle-aged character actor and bar patron with a gift for comedic roles.

Dalton can testify that neither of the tulpas wore makeup and that they both strongly resembled the actual deceased historical figures when he conversed with both of them at the bar. Dalton is mystified by these events but would strongly like to meet the ‘actors’ to congratulate them on their performances.

# Gregg Schwenk, semi-retired film producer

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

An erudite 50-year-old semi-retired producer of award-winning historical and nature documentaries. Schwenk is convinced the entire affair is “a very clever publicity stunt.” He points out that almost everyone at the bar was at least mildly intoxicated and neither Nixon nor Elvis could answer detailed or complex questions he asked about their personal lives or the era they lived in. Schwenk has a low professional opinion of the *In Search of the Supernatural* producers’ and wonders whether that show could have somehow created these events themselves...

# Loch Ness Monster Productions

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

Low-rent local offices near the John Wayne Airport. Home of *In Search of the Supernatural*.

Low-rent local offices near the John Wayne Airport, Loch Ness Productions corporate is cheerfully chaotic, with movie posters on every wall and starstruck interns everywhere. Since no one has any authority besides the owner and Chief Operating Officer Christian B. Slyvas (who spends most of his time avoiding visitors), [[the hunters]] are likely to be ‘accidentally’ locked in a storeroom filled with old movie memorabilia and props for days if they request a meeting with this august personage or come looking for payment.

# Christian B. Slyvas, OWNER, Loch Ness Productions

*Bystander: Busybody (motivation: to interfere in others’ plans)*

![[image116.jpg]]A bizarre but merry mixture of John Milius, P.T. Barnum, and William

Shatner. The over 400 pounds and bald Slyvas likes to receive first-time visitors in a Confederate General’s full-dress uniform (Slyvas is an active Civil War re-enactor) and ask for their opinions about the war between the States. Hunters who play along will likely pass his test as ‘good eggs’ and their requests will be granted; hunters who do not will be teased and pranked mercilessly in the future.
