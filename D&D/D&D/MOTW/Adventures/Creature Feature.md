Creature Feature

*By Mark Tygart*

Dedicated to the memory of Leonard Nimoy (1931-2015).

*“There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man... a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination.”*

—Rod Serling

*Creature Features: “A generic title for a genre of horror TV format shows broadcast on local U.S. television stations throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The movies broadcast on the various shows were generally classic and cult horror movies of the 1930s to 1950s, the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s, British horror films of the 1960s, and the Japanese ‘giant monster’ movies of the 1960s and 1970s.”*

# Concept

[[The hunters]] are trapped by an eerie mist that suddenly surrounds the [[small]] desert town of Nimoy, New Mexico.

Inspired by Stephen King’s *The Mist* (story, film, and miniseries).

[[The hunters]] must find a way to avoid terrible extradimensional invaders and [[close]] a portal to another reality.

The ‘Froghemoth’ first appeared in Gary Gygax’s classic *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* module *Expedition to the [[Barrier]] Peaks*.

# Hook

[[The hunters]] are having a meal in Serling’s Cafe. Maybe they are passing through on their way to follow-up another lead or to learn about accounts of a recent meteor strikes? Then an eerie green-yellow mist surrounds the town.

Soon [[the hunters]] become aware that they are now the hunted…

# Transdimensional Nexus

*Phenomenon: Portal (motivation: to draw things from one world to another)*

A transdimensional nexus has formed in Nimoy, New Mexico due to a ‘red matter’ meteor striking the desert landscape just outside the town. This links the town to the Froghemoth Dimension. Unless the nexus is closed, the entire town will be pulled into that dimension (and the citizens will be devoured by Froghemoths).

**Weakness:** Contact with mysterious ‘red matter’ (see the lab description, below).

**Custom Move:**

**Enter the Nexus**: When **someone travels into the transdimensional nexus**, roll +[[Sharp]].

On a 10+, you can see the doorway back to the real world behind you and can escape at any time.

On a 7-9, you can see the doorway back to the real world, but a froghemoth is between you and it.

On a miss, you are lost in the Froghemoth Dimension.

# The Mists

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

The nexus causes an eerie green-yellow mist to surround and fill the town. The mist is the visible sign of a space-time tangle that prevents anyone leaving town. Any person attempting to leave will reappear at another point in the town—sometimes coming back in the opposite side, sometimes just appearing at another point in the town.

The mists will dissolve when the nexus is destroyed.

# Froghemoth

*Monster: Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)*

Resembles a giant eyeless toad with a mouth covered with constantly moving tentacles. A horrifying swamp predator from another dimension, it lives in large swamps or shallow bodies of freshwater. **Powers:**

-   **Grab**: The froghemoth shoots its tongue out to try and grab someone. See the ‘grab’ move below.

**Attack:** **Swallow** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] engulf (see custom move below). **[[Armour]]:** None.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 14. \[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]

**Weakness:** Can only manifest when a transdimensonal nexus is open. If the nexus is closed, it becomes vulnerable.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**Grab**: When a **froghemoth grabs a hunter**, they roll +[[Tough]]:

-   On a 10+, the hunter breaks free and may inflict [[harm]] on the froghemoth as they escape.

-   On a 7-9, the hunter breaks free but suffers 1-[[harm]].

-   On a miss thee hunter is engulfed (see below). If the froghemoth grabs a bystander, pick one:

-   They are swallowed, but not yet dead.

-   They are being pulled inexorably towards its maw.

**Engulf**: When **a hunter is engulfed by a froghemoth’s maw**, they roll +[[Tough]]:

-   On a 10+, they force the froghemoth to vomit them forth for no additional damage.

-   On a 7-9, they suffer 2-[[harm]] or the loss of a [[valuable]] item (hunter’s choice).

-   On a miss, they suffer 4-[[harm]] and now they are being digested.

# Serling's Diner

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

Serling’s Diner is an ‘atomic cafe’, frozen in time sometime in the early

Kennedy era. You can get great burgers, malts, and shakes at very reasonable prices while the posters on the wall still promise victory in Vietnam and better living with the aid of nuclear power.

# Nichelle Wan, manager, Serling's diner

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

Nichelle thinks the froghemoth is a ‘demon from hell’ and only prayers at St. Jude’s church can save the town.

# Professor Scott's Lab

*Location: Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)*

The lab is filled with sophisticated electronics and equipment both bizarre and wondrous. This is the only truly safe place to hide from the invading creatures, but it too will eventually be destroyed by being drawn into the unforgiving alien dimension.

# Dr. Alexandra Scott

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Dr Scott knows how to [[close]] the nexus (“in theory”)—by getting the sample of rare ‘red matter’ from her lab and throwing it into the transdimensional nexus.

# Shatner's Hardware Store

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

Shatner’s Hardware Store is a place that could supply a mercenary army for a [[small]] coup. Pictures of horses adorn the walls while the shelves are filled with every type of firearm imaginable.
