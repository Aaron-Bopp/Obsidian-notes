Heartbreak Blues

*By Matthew Aaron*

# Introduction

The thing I love most about the blues is that, as an art form, it takes something broken and makes it something beautiful. The musicians’ pathos comes through in sweet six-bar riffs of wailing guitars and a steady bass heartbeat. I take [[inspiration]] from the blues not only in writing this adventure, but also during play. I recommend playing this Spotify playlist during the game: [*https://open.spotify.com/user/1262304001/* *playlist/6KdTrQNx5W9wilOxF1qS77*](https://open.spotify.com/user/1262304001/playlist/6KdTrQNx5W9wilOxF1qS77). Use it to keep you honest to the blues.

# Hook

Off the beaten path in Memphis, Tennessee, is the legendary blues joint

Johnny Ray’s. It was there that “Thundering” Joe Johnson played his last set to raucous applause. One of the regulars said that the music damn near tore your heart out.

When the club owner, Buddy Wolf, came in early this morning, he found Joe sitting on a black, cane-backed chair under the harsh white house lights with his head slumped [[forward]]. In Joe’s hands were his ‘54 Gretsch White Falcon guitar and his still-bleeding heart.

There were no cuts (or even marks) on Joe’s ashen chest. With no way to explain the horrible scene and fearing the cops would shut down the club, Buddy immediately called his cousin. A cousin who knew someone who dealt with [[Weird]] stuff. A cousin who knew one of [[the hunters]]...

# Background

Johnny Ray’s is circling the drain. Like all good things in the blues, it’s one step away from destruction, but that just amplifies the highs because the lows are so desperate. Buddy is mortgaged to his eyeballs and is looking for a way to keep Johnny Ray’s up and running. His dire straits are honey to the Heartbreaker: Buddy’s desperation makes him easy to seduce and then to destroy. The risk involved in preying on Buddy makes the reward all the more piquant as the Heartbreaker will be weakened by the beautiful music present on the nights when someone is playing the blues.

# Heartbreaker

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume profound sadness)*

The Heartbreaker is an oddity among the vampiric [[monsters]] in that rather than consuming blood or fear, it feasts on despair. It is not above getting its hands dirty and hurting people, but it would much rather consume pure anguish unalloyed with terror. To that end, it will manipulate situations to create the meal it craves.

The Heartbreaker has currently disguised itself as the Orpheum’s new theatre manager, Jacky King. **Powers:**

• **Glamour**: Always looks like a person of indescribable beauty, [[whatever]] the beholder finds most physically attractive.

**Attacks:** **Brawl** 2-[[harm]] [[hand]], **Debilitating sadness** 0-[[harm]] [[close]] [[magic]] (victims take -1 [[forward]] on a passionate action). **[[Armour]]:** 1.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 10. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** Genuine Beauty—a work of art, a pure note, anything that can be called truly beautiful.

# The Hollow

*Minion: Brutes (motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

The Hollow resemble zombies in that they are unpossessed with selfwill, but they do yet live. They are the husks of those upon whom the Heartbreaker has fed, and they serve as its attendants and muscle. Aside from their shambling, arrhythmic gait, they appear totally human—they are simply empty. **Powers:**

• **Mentally Reft**: Cannot be distracted—they have no mind or will of their own

**Attacks:** **Smashing fists** 1-[[harm]] [[hand]]. **[[Armour]]:** 1.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 4. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:** [[Loud]] sounds/music. Massive trauma.

# Buddy Wolf

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

Owner of Johnny Ray’s, and the target of Heartbreaker’s hunger. He was never able to play the blues but he sure knows a thing or two about it, both the music and otherwise.

# Nina Franklin

*Bystander: Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Buddy’s former lover, tends bar at Johnny Ray’s, knows there is something wrong about Jacky but ascribes it to lingering jealousy.

# Jim “Muddy” Vaughn

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Barfly and musician, barely escaped the Heartbreaker while touring (it looked different then). After that encounter, he went looking for Jesus in a bottle and found him at the very bottom.

# Johnny Ray's

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

Legendary blues club fallen on hard times, but the bar is stocked with smokey bourbon, and the stage lights mostly work. When the music is playing the old [[magic]] is still there, but when the daylight leaks through the dusty windows the club can look almost skeletal.

# Orpheum

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbor [[monsters]])*

The Orpheum is a newly remodelled 19th century concert hall with thick red velvet curtains and gilt balustrades. But all that is just a veneer over a building that’s ready to crumble. The illusion of beauty is what drew the Heartbreaker into making this her lair.

# Travelling Jones Records

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

Travelling Jones Records is more than just a record shop, though their collection of classic vinyl is second to none. They also deal in guitars, basses, and other musical instruments. In the back is a recording studio where a number of musicians have poured their hearts into their songs.

# Custom Moves

**Create Art**: When you channel your emotions into your talents and skills to make a beautiful work of art, say [[what you do]] and:

-   If you **use your knowledge and insight into the human condition**, roll +[[Charm]].

-   If you **tap into an observation of the world around you**, roll

+[[Sharp]].

-   If you **just let all your raw emotion loose**, roll +[[Tough]].

-   ![[image128.jpg]]If you **channel your connection to [[magic]] and other weirdness**, roll +[[Weird]].

On a hit, you make it. On a 10+, choose one from the following list.

On a 7-9, you pick one and [[the Keeper]] picks one.

-   It takes longer than you thought it would.

-   It costs you something precious. [[The Keeper]] will tell you what.

-   You’ll never make something this good again.

-   You attract a lot of unwanted attention doing it.

-   It’s fragile and will leave this world easily.
