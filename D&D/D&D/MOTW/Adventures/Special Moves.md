# Special Moves

*By Michael Sands*

Some of the hunter playbooks get a special move when they spend Luck. This optional section provides special [[moves]] for all the [[hunter types]]. I’ve included the existing ones so you have them all available for reference.

**Action Scientist Special**: When you spend a Luck, some gadget or machine near you will do something weird, malfunction, break down, or explode.

**Chosen Special**: When you spend a Luck, something from your Fate will come up in play.

**Crooked Special**: When you spend a Luck, someone from your past will reappear in your life to collect on a debt or obligation.

**Divine Special**: When you spend a Luck, you get word your Mission requires something difficult that must be done. By you. Urgently.

**Expert Special**: When you spend a Luck, you’ll discover something happening now is related to something you were involved in years ago. Maybe it’s directly due to your actions, or maybe someone else is dabbling in the same area.

**Exile Special**: When you spend a Luck, you’ll find something from your original life. Maybe something good, maybe something bad.

**Flake Special**: When you spend a Luck, pick an aspect of the current situation. [[The Keeper]] will tell you what other conspiracies that aspect is connected to. If that aspect wasn’t part of another conspiracy, it is now.

**Gumshoe Special**: When you use a point of Luck your next regular case will actually be a mystery for your hunter group, not a regular case at all (and the monster will focus its attention on you!)

**Hard Case Special**: When you spend a Luck, an enemy from your past comes back into your life. They aren’t happy to see you.

**Hex Special**: When you spend Luck, until the rest of the mystery, backlash on your spells will be extra nasty.

**Initiate Special**: When you spend a Luck, something goes wrong for your Sect: an ill-advised project or a disastrous operation. It might be your fault; it could be due to the Sect’s bad traditions.

**Meddling Kid Special**: When you spend a Luck, you will see something you weren’t supposed to see. It might help you with your current mystery or it might just scare you.

**Monstrous Special**: When you spend a Luck, your monster side gains power. Your Curse may temporarily become stronger, or another disadvantage of your Breed may manifest.

**Mundane Special**: When you spend a Luck, you’ll find something weird. Maybe even useful, but mostly just weird.

**Pararomantic Special**: When you spend a point of Luck, also mark off one of your relationship status boxes. [[The Keeper]] will bring **fate of your love** into play.

**Professional Special**: When you spend a Luck, your next mission from the Agency comes with lots of Red Tape. Lots.

**Searcher Special**: When you spend a point of Luck, your first encounter comes up in play. It could be a flashback, new occurrence, or related event.

**Snoop Special**: When you spend a Luck, you’re going to suffer some technical difficulties. Breakdowns, communication problems, weird noises in the recordings. Anything goes.

**Spell-Slinger Special**: When you spend a Luck, the official council of wizards is going to poke their nose into your business. There is always some rule, tradition, or law you have bent or broken.

**Spooky Special**: When you spend a Luck, your Dark Side’s needs will grow nastier.

**Summoned Special**: When you spend a Luck, another Sign of the Apocalypse will come to pass. When you have spent all your luck, the Apocalypse begins.

**Wronged Special**: When you spend a Luck, you find a dangerous lead on your prey. Maybe they know you’re coming or they set up the lead in order to lure you in.
