Necromancers Gambit

*By Mark Tygart*

*“Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes.”*

—H.P. Lovecraft, *The Festival*

# Concept

[[The hunters]] investigate sinister grave robberies, but in fact the whole world is at stake.

This mystery can be used as a sequel to The [[Witching Hour]] (see page 262) and [[the Keeper]] could add literature from Sunset Prayer Group to Zenobia Bellairs’ house to connect the mysteries. Zenobia, intent on gaining immortality, left the sect a few years before her death.

# Hook

Several tragic suicides by leading members of the local community have been followed by a bizarre series of grave robberies.

[[The hunters]] might be asked for help by family of the victims, local law enforcement, or a journalist covering the deaths.

# Overview

The suicides were members of a local ‘end times’ cult currently called the Sunset Prayer Group. A [[small]] gnostic sect that has survived since the Roman Empire under [[many]] names, they are trying to bring about the end of the world by means of necromancy. The necromancer Nathan Coin will be the last member of this cult. He plans to raise the four suicides as zombies and transform them into the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He stole the bodies after burying them at the town graveyard.

# Nathan Coin, mortician and necromancer

*Monster: Destroyer (motivation: to bring about the end of the world)*

A human practicing ‘Christian Necromancy.’ Nathan has an unabridged copy of the *Christian Book of the Dead* (see page 81). His other hobbies include outlandish interpretations of the Bible and taxidermy.

He owns a white van. **Powers:**

-   **Create and Command Zombies**. **Weakness:**

-   Must be killed by his own zombies.

**Attacks:** **Necromantic touch** 1-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[ignore-armour]]. **[[Armour]]:** None.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# The Zombies (Cult Suicide Victims)

*Minion: Assassins (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]])*

These are animated human corpses. Their numbers depend on how [[far]] Coin’s plans have advanced. When [[the hunters]] get involved, there are two.

They cannot cross salt barriers or running water.

**Powers:**

![[image136.jpg]]• **Infection**: Any humans they kill will arise as a zombie under the necromancer’s control, unless stuffed with salt, burned, or decapitated.

**Weakness:**

**Romero-style:** Zombies can be destroyed by decapitation, or destruction of the brain.

**Attacks:** **Bite** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[messy]]. **[[Armour]]:** None.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 4. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Note:** The necromancer is always in a protective circle of salt when commanding the zombies, otherwise they will attack and destroy him. He always carries salt with him, just in case. If the zombies devour the necromancer, their curse of unlife is over and their spirits are freed.

# Carla Kolshak, nosy reporter

*Bystander: Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)*

An able, middle-aged reporter stuck writing obituaries in the dying local newspaper. Carla longs for a big break that would catapult her to stardom.

An agnostic, Carla will always discount any evidence of the supernatural, as “that is what sank my old man’s career.”

# ![[image138.png]]“Big” Bob Carter, Police Officer

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

Veteran officer Carter thinks the whole grave robbery thing is a cruel prank. Although always polite, he is equally unimpressed with reporters, FBI profilers, and “monster hunters” who he feels get in the way of real police work. Carter ignores [[the hunters]], restricts Schniepp to consulting from his FBI office, and looks for vandals, goth kids, and other ”lowlifes” despite [[whatever]] evidence emerges.

Carter’s just a bored big city cop with a chip on his shoulder due to working in a [[small]] town. He’s retiring soon and he’s already checked out.

# Special Agent David Schniepp, FBI Profiler

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: To Reveal Information)*

This FBI profiler thinks a cult is at work, but doesn’t believe in the supernatural. He was brought in to write a profile due to the ritualistic nature of the crimes and the fact that some of the remains belonged to a recently retired FBI agent (and cult member) who specialized in forensic accounting. Schniepp looks like a veteran FBI agent but acts more like a friendly college professor.

The criminal profile Schniepp has built states the following:

-   The crimes are “ritualistic” and likely involve the practice of “necromancy” of some sort. Christian tradition largely says that necromancy is impossible at best, and any messages received from the dead are really demonic forces of Satan. Necromancy is strictly forbidden in clerical law. During the Early and High Middle Ages, however, necromancy was occasionally seen in documented practice by Christian clerics.

-   The unsub (unknown subject) is a white male in his 30-40s.

-   The unsub is unmarried, lives alone, and owns a van or truck.

-   The unsub owns a large isolated rural property. He has worked with dead bodies his whole life and finds death comforting. This fits Schniepp’s profile.

-   The unsub is personally nondescript.

-   These rituals represent the most important events in the unsub’s life.

All of these statements are true. Schniepp suspects mortuary employees and plans to check their criminal backgrounds, property ownership, and cult affiliations. Any number of avenues could lead to the necromancer. Schniepp also suggests surveillance of local graveyards as he expects further ritual exhumations will occur.

# The Graveyard

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

A typical sleepy, [[small]] American graveyard. Well, no longer so typical.

An investigation of the defiled graves can reveal the following:

-   Remains of a [[magic]] circle in goat’s blood.

-   Scratch marks from the inside of the defiled coffin with fingerprints of the dead person.

-   Full handprint of the deceased man on the tombstone.

-   Evidence that a single man disinterred the grave at night.

-   Piles of salt.

All other evidence has been obscured by recent rain at the site.

There is a [[small]] attached mortuary service with the graveyard and the staff is eager to both help investigators and to convince everyone they are not at fault. Nathan Coin’s family has operated the facility for generations.

# The Necromancer's Home

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

This house, located on a large isolated rural property, is crammed with stuffed animals (taxidermy is a natural hobby for a necromancer), mystical texts, pictures depicting the Apocalypse, framed Bible verses, etc.

In the center of it all sits Nathan Coin, brooding on the end of the world like a spider in a web.

# The Basement 

*Location: Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)*

The necromancer generally keeps his zombies “asleep,” buried in the earth in his basement. The zombies will attack if the basement is searched. He will summon them if attacked and seek to lock intruders down here for his followers to consume.
