Harvest Maze

*By Mark Tygart*

*“Even a mouse will get tired of a maze after a while.”*

—Anthony T. Hincks

# Concept

[[The hunters]] investigate a couple’s ‘disappearance.’

This mystery was inspired by the first season *Supernatural* episode

“Scarecrow,” Stephen King’s *Children of the Corn*, Hispanic legends about the Coco, and the tradition of eerie holiday corn mazes in the American Midwest.

# Hook

A series of disappearances—of multiple victims—around the same date every year has this small town’s police worried about a possible serial killer.

Either law enforcement or family members of the victims may ask [[the hunters]] to help. A Flake could notice the cycle of disappearances or be tipped off by a crime reporter. The victims share no discernible pattern of class, age, geography, ethnic group, or religious faith. All they have in common are the dates of their disappearances.

The first missing person was notable UFO expert, right wing pundit, and radio talk show host Erica Kripke. She disappeared seven years ago while investigating crop circles. This led to claims from her associates of government conspiracy and/or alien abduction. Her empty car was found next to a cornfield.

Last year it was Fabian Giroux. A retired, gay high school teacher and Canadian immigrant who disappeared in the area while sightseeing in his Winnebago. He had several cats, all named after members of the British Royal Family. The cats and the Winnebago were found on the side of the road but Professor Giroux vanished. He left no family.

The most recent disappearance, just two days ago, was a local teenaged couple: Rebecca Selby and David Kirchner. Their car was found in a popular ‘make-out’ spot near the Guzman farm, with no sign of them. There were no signs of violence. They were popular, with good grades, and seen as a model young couple. Their families remain worried.

# Overview

![[image121.png]]The disappearances were victims of a coco, caught in the enchanted maze it creates in a local cornfield to “celebrate the holidays” each year.

# Coco

*Monster: Trickster (motivation: to create chaos)*

A mythical ghost-monster from Hispanic and Lusophone folklore

The coco is a murdered child who has become a shapeshifting vampire preying on the living.

The coco is an undead, murdered child that preys on the living. Victims killed but not consumed by a coco will arise as another coco within three days of being drained.

The coco’s true form is hideous: a twisted, half-melted corpse child in rags. It normally appears as a cloaked figure (sometimes with a jacko’-lantern head) or shifts to another form. It dislikes, but can endure, sunlight. It will normally not cross salt or running water.

**Powers:**

-   **[[Shapeshifter]]**: It can appear as anything roughly between human to childsized, but radiates it magic and evil strongly.

-   **Illusions**: As well as creating spooky mazes, it can surround itself with confusing visions when attacked, forcing hunters to **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to take action.

-   **Life Drain**: See the **life drain countdown** below for the process. Hunters have a chance to intervene and stop the process after each step, if they are close enough.

**Weakness:** The sound of protective prayers.

**Attacks:** **Strike with fists** 1-[[harm]] hand. **Draining grip** 0-[[harm]] hand life-drain.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**[[Armour]]:** None

**Custom [[Moves]]:**

**Escaping The Coco**: When you are having your life drained by a coco and try to break free, roll +Tough:

-   On a 10+, you break the coco’s grip. You are free!

-   On a 7-9, choose to escape but suffer 1-[[harm]] and move to the next Life Drain countdown level, or resist for the moment but stay in its grip.

-   On a miss, you immediately suffer the next two countdown entries. **Life Drain Countdown**:

-   Day: The hunter is immobilised in pain.

-   Shadows: Extreme pain.

-   Sunset: Pain induces 1-[[harm]].

-   Dusk: Pain induces 3-[[harm]].

-   Nightfall: The hunter is unconscious.

-   Midnight: The hunter is drained and consumed by the coco.

# Guzman Farm

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

The couple was last seen near a cornfield on the Guzman farm.

A recent immigrant success story, the Guzmans operate something that is becoming exceedingly rare: a family farm. The disappearances have been clustered around this area, as well as a largely disregarded series of chupacabra sightings by drunk local teenagers (which were the coco, of course).

When investigating the cornfield [[the hunters]] will suddenly hear a women’s scream amid the corn. If the field is entered they will find themselves in a strange misty corn maze after dark (no matter the actual time).

# Vanessa Guzman

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

A bright, attractive young woman hoping for a career in the arts, she often acts as a translator for her father Fidel in business matters (despite his long residence here, he is uncomfortable speaking English).

Vanessa is convinced the “chupacabra” is a prank, because she could hear a child laughing when she saw the “small creature” in the cornfields. She wonders whether the local kids are faking a monster to create excitement in an otherwise sleepy agricultural community.

# Fidel Guzman

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

A man obsessed with making his family farm a success, Fidel becomes warm and friendly if addressed in Spanish. A pragmatic man, he worries that criminals are murdering and robbing travelers, and that the local police are trying to cover this up with ghost stories.

# The Coco's Corn Maze 

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

An illusionary labyrinth created by the coco to ‘play’ with its victims. It is always night in the maze, with a full harvest moon. The stars match no known constellations. If the coco is killed, the illusion vanishes and [[the hunters]] find themselves randomly dispersed through the Guzman corn fields.

# ![[image122.jpg]]Josh Lopez, Noisy Reporter

*Bystander: Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans).*

Josh is a young, bright, ambitious reporter from an impoverished immigrant family. He believes a serial killer targeting Hispanics has been operating in the area. Josh is fascinated with serial killers, and believes this case could also expose an American society deeply prejudiced and indifferent to the suffering of minorities.

He will try to enlist [[the hunters]] in any number of research activities that alienate the local authorities and produce little useful information.

Josh is skeptical of the supernatural, but his childhood was full of stories of folklore, including the coco.

# Molly Gunderson, Sheriff

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

Like most local law enforcement officers, Molly Gunderson finds Josh

Lopez to be highly annoying, but she secretly shares his concerns about a possible serial killer operating in the area. She is convinced that the disappearances are the work of a “Children of the Corn” satanic cult that is active among the local farm workers.

![[image124.jpg]]A middle-aged disappointed veteran of an often sexist rural law enforcement office, Molly has fallen victim to the consolations of a rather extreme Christian cult.

# Bridget's Diner

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

Everybody in this rural area meets at Bridget’s, a local institution offering wonderful middle-American food at reasonable prices. There is nothing fancy about Bridget’s but it is clean, the staff are friendly, and the pies are delicious. Sadly the coffee is not “damn fine.”

Both Josh Lopez and Melinda Gunderson are more likely to be found “talking shop” here with locals than in their respective offices.
