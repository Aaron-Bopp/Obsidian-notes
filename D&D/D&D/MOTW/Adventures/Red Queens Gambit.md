Red Queens Gambit

*By Bryanna Hitchcock*

# Concept

[[The hunters]] must find out what or who is responsible for a werewolf attack at a neighborhood store. This mystery explores gentrification, as embodied in a powerful infernal force.

# Hook

Last night, four people were killed at a liquor store by something described as a “werewolf.” The scant details available in the news are just enough to know these can’t be typical lycanthropes.

# The Red Queen

*Monster: Queen (motivation: to possess and control)*

This being (also known as Belladonna Royal) is actually a shark devil. She is the CEO and controlling interest of RQI, Red Queen Industries. Her human guise is beautiful and severe, playing the fearless, high-powered lawyer to the hilt. In her true form, she has the head of a shark, polished crimson armor, and a sword of lava.

Her goal is to gentrify and profit from poor neighborhoods through defamation, police brutality, and mass murder.

![[image145.jpg]]If the Heart of Darkness is defeated, the Red Queen will give up (for now) and withdraw her influence from the city.

**Powers:**

**Domination**.

**Wealth and vast influence**.

**Invulnerable to all but magical [[weapons]] and spells**.

**Weakness:**

**Love .** The sound of humans sharing loving words in her presence makes her physically ill and unable to attack.

**Attacks:** **Lava sword** 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[fire]].

**[[Armour]]:** 2, invulnerable to non-magical [[weapons]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 10. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# Red Ties, minions of the queen

*Minion: [[Guardian]] (motivation: to bar a way or protect something)*

These agents of the Red Queen look like special agents with dark glasses and black suits, except for the red neckties they all wear. **Powers:**

-   **Red Tape**.

-   **Connections**.

-   **Protect the Red Queen**.

-   **Call in Reinforcements**.

**Attacks:** **Guns** 2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[loud]]. **[[Armour]]:** 1.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 3. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** Except for their devotion to the Red Queen, these [[minions]] are plain humans.

# Mad Dogs, drunken werewolves

*Minion: Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)*

These hapless victims of the Red Queen’s cursed fortified wine become ferocious killing machines once they’ve consumed enough Ruby Red. **Powers:**

-   **Only harmed by [[magic]]**.

-   **Howl of fear**.

-   **Leaping**.

**Attacks:** **Claws** 2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]]. **[[Armour]]:** 0.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> **Weakness:** [[Magic]].

# The Heart of Darkness

*Phenomenon: Panic (motivation: to make people act irrationally)*

The Heart of Darkness is a sculpture of blackened steel. It’s a cubeshaped framework about a meter wide with a heart suspended in the center via spiked chains from each corner. It hangs over Belladonna Royal’s expansive office at the top of RQI HQ. Once the heart begins to power up, it sends waves of panic and violence out into the city.

Reportedly, the heart was created by a noblewoman during the

Middle Ages. When the ruling family executed her husband for his political writings, the distraught noble commissioned a forge and crafted the cage. The final step was to sacrifice her own life, giving her heart (full of hate for the rulers) to create an artifact of disruption and despair for the ages. **Powers:**

• **Curse of Miscommunication**: Once two Mad Dogs have fed on human flesh, the heart will begin twisting communication in the city where it is installed. Apply –1 [[ongoing]] to **manipulate** any bystander. The next feeding brings a further –1 [[ongoing]] to **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, as it becomes harder to think. Most [[bystanders]] will give in to panic at this point and will fight, flee, hide, or freeze.

**Weakness:** The Heart of Darkness can be defeated two ways, but there is only one way to destroy it.

Simply put, a passionate kiss in the same room with the heart will cause it to go dormant. There must be some feeling behind it or it won’t work. Once dormant, the Heart of Darkness is harmless until the elaborate activation spell can be repeated.

The chains that bind it in place can take a total of 8-[[harm]]. If [[the hunters]] try to break the installation (and it’s not dormant), the Heart lashes out with black lighting (2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[magic]] lightning [[ignore-armour]]). If the installation is destroyed, the artifact loses its connection to the city and the phenomenon is defeated.

To destroy the Heart of Darkness for good, the frame must be dismantled and the heart buried with the rest of the old Countess of Winchester’s body in the UK.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** The Chains, 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

# RQI HQ

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

From the nearby business district, the new RQI building towers over the neighborhood. At night, the gigantic letters on the side of the building cast a bloody light on the neighborhood. At 52 floors, it’s not the tallest skyscraper in the city, but its fortress-like construction makes it one of the most secure. Filled with business people during the day from a variety of companies occupying a floor or [[small]] office in the building, security is still tightly in the grip of the Red Ties. It will take a creative group of monster hunters to make their way to the penthouse office on the secret 53rd floor. There they will face the Red Queen herself, as well as the Heart of Darkness.

The RQI building provides an opportunity to control the pace of your game. Depending on how much time you have left, you can make building security a significant challenge or a trivial one.

# The Neighborhood

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

The neighborhood affected by the Red Queen’s plot is an important location in the mystery. The nature of the neighborhood will change, depending on what city you choose to set your game in. Even if you choose a fictional city, present the neighborhood as a special place where the buildings, businesses, and families have [[history]]. From food to crafts and music, there are delicacies and delights available in the neighborhood that don’t exist elsewhere in the world.

But old neighborhoods often have dark sides. Alcoholism, homelessness, and addiction are common associates of the cultural freedoms that give character to a neighborhood scene. Don’t shy away from the nitty gritty of life in the city.

# Maggie

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Maggie lives on the streets. She’s dressed like an academic, but her clothing is filthy and in disrepair. Her face is wrinkled and haunted.

She saw Sammy drinking Ruby Red just before he “got all furry” and ate people in the liquor store. She says Ruby Red just came out a few days ago, but some of the other street dwellers have really taken to it. Maggie will ask [[the hunters]] more than once if they have a smoke to spare.

If a hunter has a spare smoke, Maggie will also mention that Pete’s been buying Ruby Red and he hangs out by the smoke shop. This may give [[the hunters]] an opportunity to disrupt [[the countdown]].

# Other Threats

-   Characters in the community (homeless, hipsters, local families)

-   Other [[locations]] in the community (bar, smoke shop, indie record store, liquor store, the diner, tenement buildings, family homes)

# Custom Moves

**Drinking Ruby Red**: Ruby Red is nothing more than cheap fortified wine. But when stamped with the RQI label (really a disguised rune of rage) it becomes a potion that turns people into ravening Mad Dogs.

A bystander turns into a Mad Dog after drinking Ruby Red three times.

When **a hunter drinks Ruby Red**, they roll +[[Cool]]:

-   On a 10+ the drink is merely disgusting, but you have a vision and may ask a question from the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** list.

-   On a 7-9, choose 1:

-   You grow claws and lose –1 [[Sharp]] until the curse is removed.

-   You grow fangs and lose –1 [[Charm]] until the curse is removed.

-   Sickened, you lose –1 [[Tough]] until you eat something.

-   On a miss, you still get a vision and may ask a question. [[The Keeper]] advances [[the countdown]] and hints that they’ve gained a lot of unwanted supernatural attention. The Red Queen knows the drinker by name and face.
