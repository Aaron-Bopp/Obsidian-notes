Hollow Lake

*By Chris Stone-Bush*

# Concept

![[image130.png]]For over 70 years, Katsuko Tanigawa had a deal with a kappa, a Japanese water spirit. She continued this practice after leaving Japan and moving in with her daughter’s family upon her husband’s death. The entity—bound by contract—relocated with her and now resides in the lake [[close]] to the edge of the family’s property.

Katsuko never told anyone. Her daughter Emiko assumed the [[small]] suitengu shrine her mother asked to have built on the lake’s edge was simply a way to help deal with culture shock. Since Katsuko’s death late last year, no one is leaving offerings for the kappa and it has gone back to procuring its favorite food: human livers.

This mystery takes place in an affluent suburb. Most of the residents have jobs in the nearby city, and the whole community is well-off. The town is built around a large lake, with almost every property having some kind of lakefront access. [[Many]] families live here year round, though some houses are summer homes and others are expensive rental properties. The town gets bigger during the summer holidays, though residents and renters tend not to mingle.

# Hook

![[image131.png]]Samuel Voss was a retiree and avid fisherman who was a fixture of the lakeside. His corpse just washed up and is being called a boating accident. However, the coroner is baffled because the body is missing its liver and intestines, with no sign of how they were removed.

# The Kappa

*Monster: Devourer (motivation: to consume people)*

Kappa are short, ugly goblins with scaled skin, webbed hands and feet, and a thick turtle shell covering their chest and back. On the top of their heads, damp hair surrounds a shallow, bowl-like depression filled with water. Kappa often pretend to be drowning children in order to lure people out into deep water, where their victim is drowned or strangled. The kappa then eats the intestines and liver, sucking the organs out through the victim’s anus. The only thing they like better than human livers are cucumbers—they ignore anything else in favor of cucumbers.

**Powers:**

**Aquatic**: With both lungs and gills, kappa can outswim any human, and stay underwater indefinitely.

**Ridiculously strong**: They love to wrestle, and are very good at it.

**Custom Move:**

**Wrestling Grab**: When you’re grabbed by a kappa, roll +[[Tough]]:

-   On a 10+, choose two two of the following options.

-   On a 7-9, choose one.

-   On a miss, pick none; you’re in big trouble.

Grabbed by kappa options:

-   You remain on your feet.

-   You can breathe.

-   Your arms are free.

**Attacks:** **Webbed claws** 2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[quick]]. **Beaked mouth** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[messy]]. **Strangle** (only used on people the creature has already **wrestling grabbed**) 4-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[ignore-armour]].

**[[Armour]]:** **Rock-hard shell:** 4-[[armour]]. Kappa can extend and retract both their limbs and head into their shells instantly; getting past the shell means catching them completely unaware, targeting a soft spot, or using some kind of [[magic]].

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:**

**Repelled by** ginger, sesame, and iron.

**Head Bowl:** If the kappa bows, the water in its head will spill out rendering the kappa immobile until refilled. (The water is magical and won’t spill under any other circumstances.) Common ways of getting a kappa to bow are by making formal [[introductions]] at the beginning of a sumo wrestling match or a game of shogi. If a human refills the depression of an immobilized kappa, it must uphold its end of a bargain faithfully without malice or deception.

# The Lake

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbor [[monsters]])*

Fed by an underground spring, the lake is cold, murky, and deep. It’s large enough for [[small]], single-engine watercraft, and most families have a rowboat or a canoe. A committee monitors the chemistry of the water and the health of the local wildlife, especially the fish population.

The kappa is most active after dark, when it circles the lake looking for prey. If no one is in the water, it either wades ashore or lures people [[close]] enough to ambush by pretending to be a drowning child. Its lair is a [[small]], submerged chamber at the end of a short tunnel exiting under a large, flat rock [[close]] to the Miklesons’ shoreline. Finding the monster while it’s in the lake will require a lot of preparation or substantial [[magic]]—or both.

# Emiko and Peter Mikleson

*[[Bystanders]]: Skeptics (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Emiko is the grown daughter of Katsuko Tanigawa and runs a pediatric clinic in the nearby city. She practices Shinto, the traditional religion of Japan, and still observes important holidays and practices. Emiko knows the folk stories of kappa and other yokai, but does not believe they actually exist. Her husband Peter is a successful real estate agent. Smart investments have left him and his family very well-off, and he now spends most of his time at charity board meetings or on the golf course. A practical man, Peter is not at all superstitious and flat out refuses to believe the deaths are anything more than unfortunate accidents.

# Takahiro Mikleson

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

Takahiro is a university student who is home for the spring or summer, depending on when the mystery takes place. He spent summers with his grandmother as a teenager, where she told him all the traditional Japanese stories. He can help identify the creature living in the lake if [[the hunters]] bring him evidence or ask for his help.

If he’s told what’s going on, he’ll assume the kappa is somehow responsible for his grandmother’s death. He’ll go off to deal with the monster himself and, despite knowing the creature’s trick, will ultimately fail, ending up as another body floating in the lake.

# Katsuko Tanigawa, deceased

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Despite Katsuko having died late last year, it is possible for [[the hunters]] to talk with her, perhaps with [[magic]].

Katsuko was born in 1923 in Saga Prefecture, a [[small]] rural [[area]] on the northwestern edge of Kyushu. Walking home from high school one night, she was trapped by the kappa. Remembering the stories her mother told her, Katsuko politely challenged the creature to a sumo match, which it had to accept. She tricked it into bowing, forcing it to agree to a deal: she’d leave it a cucumber twice a year and it would leave the people in her town alone.

The best places to contact Katsuko are near the butsudan (the family altar) in the Miklesons’ home, or at the suitengu shrine near the shore.
