Big Haunt on Campus

*By Jason D’Angelo*

# Concept

A college freshman, new to witchcraft, has summoned a spirit for a dark task. The spirit has ideas of its own and breaks free to systematically punish unfaithful lovers all over the campus.

# Hook

The annual Valentine’s Party at the Triple Phi fraternity is legendary, but the bodies found on the lawn aren’t usually dead. This year, basketball star Louis “The Buck” Buckner was hurled from his window during the party. His room was locked from the inside, and his girlfriend, Candy, was in the bathroom at the time. Buckner was thrown with such force he cleared the porch roof on the way to the lawn. When found, his lifeless body was covered in a thin layer of frost, although it was an unusually warm winter’s night. There was no other frost nearby.

# Background

Before the winter break, The Buck had a one-night stand with Shelly Young. The morning after, filled with regret, The Buck told Young he had made a mistake and could never see her again. Young played it cool—but decided that if Buckner’s long-time girlfriend were out of the picture, she and The Buck could be together.

Young’s obsession reached its peak in early February, when she found a book of spells in the university library. Inspired, she gathered up supplies and attempted to summon a revenge demon. Shelly lacked the skill and experience to summon the demon she sought but but she did manage to summon something...else. Evelyn Bradshaw was murdered by Eric Clevinger in the same dorm room 40 years before. When Shelly lifted the veil, she allowed this vengeful spirit to enter our world. Mistaking Evelyn for the demon, Shelly told her an elaborate tale of Candy’s infidelities and sent the spirit off to kill her. When Evelyn watched the couple, she discerned the truth and killed Buckner instead.

# Evelyn Bradshaw, ghost

*Monster: Executioner (motivation: to punish the guilty).*

Evelyn, in her freshman year, had an affair with a young married professor (Eric Clevinger) whom she loved and who she thought loved her. She became pregnant. Afraid that Evelyn and her secret could ruin his life, the professor came to her room one night, pushed her from her open window, and watched her fall four floors to the pavement. He fled and the death was presumed to be a suicide.

Evelyn is now a spirit of vengeance, punishing those who break their lovers’ vows. If any of [[the hunters]] fit the bill, be sure to send Evelyn after them.

She appears as an apparition of an 18-year-old, in a faded print dress from the 70s. The back of her head is caved in from the fall that killed her, and she holds her head at an impossible angle on her ghostly broken neck.

**Powers:**

• **Frost Grasp**: When **Evelyn reaches through your chest and grabs your heart**, take 3-[[harm]] ignore-[[armour]] magic, then roll +Weird:

On a 10+, you resist and see into her soul; ask [[the Keeper]] a single question about her and they will answer you honestly.

On a 7-9, you see into her soul, but she also sees into yours; ask your question, but Evelyn will have a question or two for you as well: answer her honestly.

On a miss, take an additional [[harm]] and answer honestly the questions she asks you.

**Attacks:** **Telekinesis:** 0 to 3-[[harm]] close ignore-[[armour]] cold. Evelyn can throw objects or push victims—pick [[harm]] rating based on danger level. This leaves a frost that will melt into ectoplasmic goo.

**[[Armour]]:** None, but she cannot be harmed by normal [[weapons]] (except while using her frost grasp).

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 8. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weaknesses:**

An apology, or **[[big magic]]** exorcism.

She will go away willingly with a heartfelt apology from Eric Clevinger, the professor who murdered her. She will claim him and the two will dramatically disappear.

She can also be exorcised by **[[big magic]] .** Possible requirements for the ritual: one or two more people than there are hunters; must be performed in the dorm room where she was first summoned; will take time and chanting, possibly attracting unwanted attention and innocents.
