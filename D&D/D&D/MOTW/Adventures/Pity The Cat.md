Pity The Cat

*By Marek Golonka*

# Concept

During the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, Abraham Mertens was mayor of a [[small]] town, and wanted to make sure it grew big and prosperous. He was a practical man but also a dabbler in dark arts, so he made a pact with The Starry Order. [[The Order]] is an inhuman force that creeps into minds of humans and makes them more and more rational, duty-bound, efficient, and (sadly) devoid of emotions. For Mertens, this was a [[small]] price to pay for the town’s prosperity.

The plan didn’t succeed. An old kabbalist [[Mystic]] in the town, Jacob, sensed the mayor’s [[magic]] and countered it with his own. Jacob enchanted all the cats in town so that every night they would meow into the sky, creating chaos and dissonance to keep The Starry Order at bay. Everybody in town loved cats, and they were protected from people who would hurt them in order to stop the ‘noise,’ so this enchantment worked well.

The Starry Order kept trying to control the town because it was bound by Mertens’ pact. For over a century it was repelled by the cats, but now it has another chance: The town is being incorporated into a large city. Tower blocks are being built, people are becoming busier, and they are easier prey for [[the Order]]. And, of course, they have less time and affection for their cats…

# Hook

This mystery works best if one of [[the hunters]] is somehow connected to the town and returns there after a long absence.

If that doesn’t fit, use one of these:

-   [[The hunters]] pass through the town and notice both the cats’ strange behaviour and the unnatural constellations in the sky.

-   [[The hunters]] discover Jacob’s diary which describes the affair, and hear that the town is currently being assimilated into a city.

-   [[The hunters]] are asked to adopt a cat because there are new anti-cat laws in the town.

# The Starry Order

*Phenomenon: Panic (motivation: to make people act irrationally)*

An ancient force of flawless precision and heartless rationalism.

The universe is a malfunctioning watch waiting to be set correctly. The

Order can intervene in human affairs only when invited (typically via a [[magic]] ritual).

When [[The Order]] is present in an [[area]], people there become more and more rational, organized, and cold. They see no point in their life beyond performing their duties in the most efficient and precise way possible. Duties enforced by laws and contracts are felt most strongly under The Starry Order. so all the informal needs, promises, and habits are suppressed.

Oh, and the stars above the afflicted terrain form strangely regular patterns, hence [[the Order]]’s name. **Powers:**

-   **Rationality**: Makes people act ultra-rationally and put their legal or societal obligations above all else (in particular, over their emotional obligations and needs).

-   **Inception**: Can implant thoughts into the minds of people strongly affected by its influence.

**Weaknesses:**

**Chaos:** The more that chaotic, unorganized, and uneven things happen in the afflicted [[area]], the weaker The Starry Order becomes.

**Pacts:** As an entity of order, it can’t break pacts with other beings. It will also be severely weakened if forced or tricked into making contradictory pacts.

**[[Custom Moves]]:**

**Order From Without**: [[The hunters]] aren’t free from [[the Order]]’s influence. When the mystery reaches Dusk and every step thereafter, [[the Keeper]] holds 2. [[The Keeper]] may spend a [[hold]] to make a hunter **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to do something unconnected to their Orderly obligations. And remember that, for [[many]] monster hunters, the quest is often purely a personal one.

# The Town

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

This town was a farming community up to the 19th century, when the

Industrial Revolution gave it a railway station and a few factories. It still retained a quaint feel and a balance between serenity and prosperity through the 20th century. As a nearby metropolis grew larger, more and more townspeople started working working there. The town has now decided to become a suburban district of the city. The inhabitants have mixed feelings: they look [[forward]] to better communication and more job opportunities, but also fear the town could lose its [[Charm]] and individuality.

Notable places:

-   Statue of Abraham Mertens.

-   Suburban railway station.

-   Local [[history]] museum.

-   A closed synagogue.

-   An old wool factory.

-   Animal shelter.

-   Yvonne Dierckx’s coffeehouse.

# The Cats

*[[Bystanders]]: Innocents (motivation: to do the right thing)*

The town was always proud of its huge population of cats. They were well-fed, sheltered, and treated with love and respect. Nowadays people still like them but [[many]] residents have no time to play with and care for the little felines.

Jacob’s spell still affects all the cats in the city. Every time The Starry

Order tries to influence the town, the cats meow and yowl throughout the night. Nowadays, however, their cries offer a weaker protection because they are regularly drowned out by the noises of passing cars and trains.

![[image141.png]]When a cat is taken away from the town, they lose the connection to the spell. On the other [[hand]], a cat who comes into the town will join the spell within a few days.

# Marjan Claes

*Minion: Thief (motivation: to steal for [[the Order]])*

The main cat-catcher in town works for the animal shelter. Until today, she was a gentle soul with a soft spot for cats.

As The Starry Order has widened its influence and townspeople complain more and more about the noise, she has changed her attitude, simply wanting to get the job done and not caring about the animals.

# Prisca Pauwels

*Minion: Right [[Hand]] (motivation: to backup [[the Order]])*

The current mayor of the town. She has returned from studies in a big city worried that her hometown has too little contact with the world. She won an election promising modernisation and openness. She genuinely wishes the town well and doesn’t want it to lose all its [[Charm]], but she’s easy prey for the manipulations of The Starry Order.

# Roelof Pauwels

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put himself in danger)*

Roelof is an open and helpful young man who works at the local museum and guides people through the old synagogue.

As Prisca’s younger brother, he will be the first to notice that something is wrong with her. He might do stupid things to try to “wake her up”, like suggesting [[the hunters]] help him kidnap Prisca or throwing a cat at her.

# Sterre Geerts

*Bystander: Sceptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

An honest, hard-working woman and Marjan’s partner. She isn’t as susceptible to The Starry Order as her girlfriend, but she will protect Marjan from any accusations, believing she just does what’s best for the community.

It will be very hard to make her believe in anything supernatural.

# Yvonne Dierckx

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

An elegant old lady who runs a charming coffeehouse at the main square. Friendly and open but also quite concerned with what’s proper. She keeps a few cats in her coffeehouse but will chase them off when [[the Order]] gets to her.
