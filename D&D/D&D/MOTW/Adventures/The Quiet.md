The Quiet

*By Kane Cathain*

# Concept

A movement known as The Quiet formed a [[small]] commune in the

Arizona desert. Led by a man known as All-Father Stillness, the followers were dedicated to an extreme form of meditation in an attempt to free their minds from their bodies. The Quiet disappeared overnight years ago and was forgotten, with no evidence of their existence except for a smattering of concrete domes left in the desert next to the town of Alton’s Bend.

# Hook

A few days ago, a visitor to Alton’s Bend found the town empty. Of the residents, the visitor only found three corpses—in the gas station with rags shoved down their throats and wood in their ears.

# All-Father Stillness, spiritual manifestation

*Monster: Queen (motivation: to possess and control)*

Dr. Jon Hansen (or “All-Father Stillness”) gathered followers under a movement he named “The Quiet.” The Quiet was dedicated to shedding the physical world through meditation. Hansen was the first to achieve this willful separation of his spirit from his body. After this revelation, he brought the most proficient practitioners of his methods to the desert with him. After a year of training and preparation, they were cemented inside concrete domes with no doors or windows in an attempt to shut out the outside world completely. The members of The Quiet would succeed in transcendence or die in failure.

All-Father Stillness walked deep into the desert and abandoned his body, committing himself fully to walking the Earth eternally as a spirit. After a long journey, he found his way back to the commune and waited for his followers to join him in their spirit forms. Once they gathered together, they would show the world what they had done and bring their “gift” to all.

The All-Father will not show himself to [[the hunters]] until after at least two of his followers have been destroyed. **Powers:**

-   **Invulnerable**: [[The hunters]] must force him to manifest, otherwise they cannot hurt him with physical attacks.

-   **Enforced Stillness**: He creates a zone of absolute silence in a 10-meter radius around himself. Within this zone an oppressive spectral force seeps into the bodies of the living, attacking them with **Force of Silence** each minute they are in the zone.

**Attacks:** **Choke** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[ignore-armour]]. **Force of Silence** 1-[[harm]] [[close]] [[magic]] [[ongoing]]. **[[Armour]]:** 2

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 12. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:** [[Loud]] noises will distract him to the point that his form wavers, causing him to manifest and become vulnerable to attack.

# The Disembodied Quiet, spiritual manifestations

*Minion: Parasite (motivation: to infest, control and devour)*

The members of The Quiet achieved transcendence and have gatheredwith All-Father Stillness in their spiritual form. Unfortunately they only transcended to being ghosts, trapped and unable to return to life or move on. Their only focus is to spread the “the gift” to anyone they see. Any noise provokes them to rage and to attempt to silence its source.

Over the years, the distance they are able to roam has extended from the cement structures in which they died, putting Alton’s Bend in their path. They appear as semi-transparent versions of their human form, with long hair and naked bodies thinned by starvation.

They stand still with disturbingly blank stares and will only move when unseen. Should anyone observing them turn away, or even blink, The Disembodied will suddenly be closer until they reach their ghostly hands deep into their victim’s throats. **Powers:**

• **[[Incorporeal]]**: The Disembodied Quiet are [[Incorporeal]] forms who should be treated as having 3-[[armour]] (against any [[harm]]) unless their weakness is being exploited.

**Attacks:** **Choke** 3-[[harm]] [[close]] [[ignore-armour]].

**[[Armour]]:** 3 when [[Incorporeal]], otherwise 0.

**[[Harm]] Capacity:** 5. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup>

**Weakness:**

**Noise:** [[Loud]] noises will distract the spirits to the point that their forms waver and they become vulnerable to attack. Their bodies (inside the cement structures) are vulnerable to physical destruction, which will also destroy the spirit.

# Alton's Bend

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

Alton’s Bend is little more than a cluster of buildings in a horseshoe arrangement, with the One Stop Gas & Grocery at the apex. The town is quite [[far]] away from civilisation: the tension can be ratcheted up by having no cell reception and [[the hunters]]’ vehicle running on fumes by the time they get there (maybe they’re even walking the last mile into town).

After [[the countdown]] reaches Shadows, the bodies of two state police are found in the center of town near their patrol car (which has its doors sitting wide open).

The town seems to have been hurriedly abandoned. A stroller lies on its side along the sidewalk with toys and a blanket strewn about. A cold cup of coffee and a half-eaten sandwich sit on a bench. A pruner sits next to a pile of recently cut flowers. The surviving residents are hiding, too scared to make any noise lest the Disembodied Quiet find them. A few of them have made the connection between the spirits they are seeing and the members of The Quiet who once lived in the desert.

# One Stop Gas & Grocery

*Location: Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)*

The hoses have been torn from the gas pumps, resulting in large puddles of gas soaking the surrounding gravel. Any kind of flame or spark could cause some serious damage to a large [[area]].

Inside the building is a combination gift shop, sandwich counter, and woefully [[small]] grocery.

Dead bodies are in the kitchen and the basement. Broken pieces of broom handles have been shoved in their ears and dish rags shoved down their throats.

The Disembodied Quiet patrol here and will soon see and stalk [[the hunters]] as they investigate the grisly scene.

# The Quiet Commune

*Location: Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)*

A banner hangs over what was the entrance to the commune. Now split in half and in tatters, it reads “THE QUIET IS STILL... HE MIND.”

The remains of wooden shelters can be found reduced to rubble and scattered about.

Four-foot tall concrete domes are still very much intact and are a shining white after years of being bleached by the sun. The domes are completely sealed, their entrances having been seamlessly cemented over.

Inside the domes are the naked and emaciated bodies of the members of The Quiet, who are now haunting Alton’s Bend.

A [[close]] check of the bodies reveals they are still alive. Their corporeal form has been slowed to such a point that they still possess the tiniest flicker of life, though there is no chance their spirits can rejoin them. Destroying these bodies will destroy the spirits instantly.

# Custom Moves

**Bring the noise**: **When making noise** [[loud]] enough to drown out a conversation at 10 paces (e.g. banging on sheet metal, turning a car stereo up full blast) to disrupt the Disembodied Quiet, roll +(whichever Rating is most appropriate):

-   On a 10+, all spirits in the nearby [[area]] are forced to manifest. When manifested, they are vulnerable to attack.

-   On a 7-9, all spirits in the [[area]] are forced to manifest and the hunter chooses 1:

-   All spirits in the [[area]] focus their attacks on you.

-   All spirits in the [[area]] are enraged and now cause +1 [[harm]] (increasing each time this option is selected).

-   The noise disorients you (–1 to [[Sharp]] for 30 minutes—this can only be chosen once per hunter).

-   On a 6 or less, all spirits in the [[area]] focus their attacks on you.
