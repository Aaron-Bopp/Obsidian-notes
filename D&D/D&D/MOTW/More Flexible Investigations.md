# More Flexible Investigations

*By Michael Sands*

Some players find the list of allowed questions in the normal **investigate a mystery** move to be too restrictive. They’re designed to focus on the immediate monster-killing needs of the hunters in the game’s default style.

If you would like something a bit more open-ended, you can use this alternative basic move:

When you **investigate a mystery** with your particular techniques and skills, roll +Sharp:

-   On a 10 or higher, ask the Keeper two general questions or one specific question. Based on how you are investigating, they will tell you honestly and with good detail what you discover.

-   On a 7 to 9, ask the Keeper one general question. Based on how you are investigating, they will tell you honestly and with reasonable detail what you discover.

-   On a miss, ask the Keeper one general question. They may answer it as they wish. Regardless of the question and answer, something bad happens.

When you advance this move, add this extra result:

-   On a 12 or higher, as 10 or higher but you may ask one additional question—specific or general, your choice.

## Moves That Grant Different Questions

Many hunters have moves that grant special questions to ask instead of the usual list. To ensure these moves are still valuable, they now grant one of those special questions *in addition to* the questions granted by your **investigate a mystery** move result.

## For The Keeper

In all other ways, this variant of the **investigate a mystery** move works just the same as the original.

What a hunter discovers still depends on the evidence that is (or could be) present and how they are investigating it. Hunters cannot get answers to questions that do not fit with the investigation techniques they’ve used, nor can they discover things if there’s no way that relevant evidence could be at this scene.

It’s okay to tell the player the method they are using uncovers no evidence of the type they are looking for. If this lack of evidence is, itself, an important discovery then using up a question is well worth it. If the lack of evidence is not significant, don’t count the question for the purposes of the move. Let the hunter ask another.
