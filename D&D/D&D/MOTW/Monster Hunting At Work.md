Monster Hunting At Work

*By Jamie Sands*

I set up a casual *Monster of the Week* group with some of my workmates. We play every fortnight or so during lunchtime, or after work on a Friday over drinks. We started by spending one session on character creation and going over how their characters know each other, what the rules mean, and how to use [[moves]]. None of them had played a Powered by the Apocalypse game before.

Running in an office lunchtime setting is a very different beast to an [[ongoing]] campaign with regular three-hour sessions. You have to accept it’s going to be casual—people will have meetings come up, [[heavy]] workloads, and other things they didn’t anticipate. So you need to ensure the game you’re running is easy for the characters to drop in and out of.

With a little less than an hour to play while also consuming food, you have to drop some aspects of the game. In my case, I dropped world building. The group decided to set the game in the city we live in: easy, everyone knows what it looks like, how [[many]] people will be nearby at any time of day or night, how long it takes to get around, and the ways people will react to weirdness.

Mystery-wise, I keep things simple: not too [[many]] [[bystanders]] to interact with (one or two, tops), easy-to-find information on the monster, and a [[quick]]-paced story. I push them to make rolls if they seem uncertain (there’s very little time to sit around and puzzle out the next move). I’m flexible with the questions for **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** or **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**. If none of the options on the move list look [[useful]] for keeping the pace fast, I’ll get them to ask something directly, or just say “You did well enough to find out this thing.”

This kind of game would also really suit the new ‘flexible investigations’ rules (page 29), especially since giving the players another chance to roll the dice opens up new opportunities for plot twists.

Although I frequently write monster countdowns, it’s mostly so I have an idea of the kind of thing the monster is planning or hoping for—I don’t use it religiously.

A few times we’ve gotten through a whole mystery in under an hour, but the players also enjoy it when we spread a mystery over two sessions. When splitting the mystery I try and leave it on a cliffhanger. Good cliffhangers I’ve used are: the team are just about to fight the monster; they’ve found out an intriguing bit of information that sparks the imagination; they’ve just discovered things are worse than they thought.

Each session I try and emphasise the weirdness of what they’re experiencing, have at least one fight scene, some investigation, and give them the opportunity to try out new things. That way we’re getting the most out of the system and each character can do some [[Cool]] stuff.

If they come up with what seems like a silly, plot-derailing plan then

I run with it, especially if everyone at the table is laughing. We had our Flake decide that the way to get into the second-floor apartment above a dry cleaner was to take off his shirt and get it washed. The dry cleaners weren’t involved with the mystery, but they did call the police to investigate the weirdo who was bugging them, thereby leaving the way clear for the rest of the team to sneak in the back way.

My biggest piece of advice is not to get your mind set on any one way a story should go. Jjust come up with a monster and the kind of thing it’s doing and then let the players go wild. Be willing to throw out all your prep and don’t worry about it; follow what the players are into and you’ll all have a great time.

The point of these sessions is to have fun, and the inter-team bonding has had positive effects in our work relationships as well. Some of us are in vastly different roles in different areas of the business, but building common ground through gaming has opened up communication channels and built trust we wouldn’t have had otherwise.

I’ve been asked to run the game twice in one week, due to the investment the players have in the game, so I’d definitely recommend giving it a go if you have some fellow office geeks.
