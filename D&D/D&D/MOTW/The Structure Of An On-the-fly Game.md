The [[Structure]] Of An On-the-fly Game

*By Daniel Steadman*

# History

My credentials for writing this? That I am categorically incapable of running a prepared game. I am hopefully a better GM/MC/ST (or [[whatever]] you want to call it) now than when I started out as a GM of such games as *Advanced Dungeons and Dragons* and similar, but I had to change my style to ‘freeform’ early in the piece.

My breakthrough towards easier gaming came from *SLA Industries*. The reason this was different was a framing device they called a ‘Blueprint News file.’ This little game prop consisted of a short description of the current mission designed to prepare the players, but it did not provide any real content. I started giving players a list of jobs on offer and letting them pick their mission. I had no idea what they would pick or what would happen when they did. These little job descriptions... blew… my… mind!

Suddenly games made sense to me in a way they never had before. Stories came first with details a distant second. I didn’t have to figure out in advance what would happen if they killed the lich, turned right instead of left, or wore the mysterious hat. Instead my games were fast and organic. If players needed a clue to advance the story then they found that clue. If a character was a dick to a bystander, I had the freedom to suddenly reveal that bystander to be important.

This was enormously liberating and at total odds with everything I had [[learned]] before. I could spend time during a game using the story to refer back to previous events whenever that was [[Cool]] or interesting. I could assess the emotional state of players and adjust the script accordingly. Without the weight of meticulous preparation, I had more free time which left me happier and more willing to run games. I could also listen to the players’ dingbat plans and, instead of sobbing as I threw away a meticulously prepared setup when they blew up the prison instead of investigating as they were ‘supposed to,’ I could just roll with it.

The long and short of it is that games became easier to run, took zero preparation time, could cope with the goofiest players, and got detailed and emotional whenever a scene demanded it.

# How's That Work?

[[Many]] people aren’t comfortable with this style of running games but if you are interested in trying it, then here are a few [[useful]] insights.

The first thing you need to do is come up with the two ‘opening lines’ to start the scenario. This should be both vague and descriptive, focusing on useless but interesting details. Don’t think about how it will end, just the beginning. You are now in the same state of understanding as your players. I usually try to take two or three random things, smush them together and come up with an odd story hook. With *Monster of the Week*, an example might be: I notice something orange as I glance around the room, the word ‘[[Sharp]]’ randomly pops into my head, and I decide wings would be [[Cool]]. I write down “*Weekly World News* reports

‘Orange Winged Lizard Person Found In Vivisection Horror House.” It could just as easily be “Whole Town turns orange” or “Bigfoot has an axe to grind with a flock of axebeaks.”

To get your opening lines, expand on that: be detailed but not specific. “Police express alarm in Poughkeepsie” or “Upsurge in suicides; parents blame rock and roll music.”

At this point you are almost done for an on-the-fly game’s prep. I realise we have not given characteristics to the monster, we don’t have any [[bystanders]], and we definitely don’t have any stats written down.

This is important. Once you nail down exactly what the story is about, you lose the wiggle room to drive the story and it becomes about the details.

Now deliver [[the Hook]]: describe what [[the hunters]] know (which is almost nothing). They are driving by a creepy old house in the rain when their car stops. They receive a vision of that strange old dude who was eating bacon at the diner. They see something in the headlines or the ad section of the paper. [[Whatever]] the source, give them their hook in a format that makes sense, is a clear call to action, and tells them diddly.

Then you find out what the mystery is right alongside the players. They will provide most of the story when they ask questions. The key is to rarely say “No” and instead give plenty of “Yes.”

“I look for a guy that looks like he knows what’s going on” leads to “Well this guy across the street has a video camera—maybe you could ask him?”

“Does anything strike me as odd about this diner?” leads to “You mean apart from the stench of death wafting through the kitchen doors?”

Be fast and loose here. Being exactly right doesn’t matter. What matters is spring-boarding every event and encounter into something else [[Cool]] and interesting. Very soon you will be able to create a framework that events sit in, and you can start to define the main threat one word at a time. Once it all makes sense, the players will know what they need to do because they know the threat is violent, huge, and underground (or however you’ve defined it during play). You already know a couple of things from your two lines earlier and this is where you tie them in.

When it is obvious to you what the threat is, bring it all together. Your one-word-at-a-time definition will suggest what the monster’s motivations, weaknesses, and strengths are. Call for a short break and take a moment to work those out. Then you can push the game through to the finish. Add a twist. It’s really a government conspiracy, or it’s all in a child’s mind, or it was clowns all along, or the Ancients have awoken, or [[whatever]].

This style of running a game relies on flexibility as you play. That can be pretty scary if you [[haven]]’t had much experience! The good news is that you are never wrong: you never have to deal with players ruining your story and that makes it easier to be fans of their characters. Plus, you rarely have to stop to check your notes.

# Guidelines for On-the-fly Mayhem

To make things easier, I have created a [[small]] [[inspiration]] guide to illustrate how easy this [[structure]] can be. Print out this template (or the expanded version that follows), and circle descriptors as they become relevant. You will likely find that you only need to do this once or twice before you get the hang of running games in this style.

Start with a couple of opening lines taken from things around you or previous stories. Remember to be purposely vague.

Hook the players with a call to action.

Decide if the [[First Encounter]] will help or hinder [[the hunters]]. Then pick one of the following: They are attacked; Someone tells them something (is it true?); They find a clue.

Pick some descriptors:

-   **What?** Unusual, odd, [[Weird]], large number of, strange, disappearances, reappearances, appearances, brutal, mysterious, unexplained, ritualistic, inexplicable, irrational, unearthly, hoax, ancient, new, unnatural, spooky, unidentified.

-   **Where?** An old town, a [[small]] village, a ship, an island, a new town, abandoned, big city, prison, museum, ‘haunted’ house, remote park, abandoned asylum, old woods, lonely highway, farm, sorority, fraternity, lab, cave, lake, military base, old hotel, mansion, corn fields.

-   **(Optionally) Who?** Missing, hitchhikers, trampers, newlyweds, teens, elderly, minority members, the homeless, misshapen, children, respectable townsfolk, rich folk, farmers, students, recent arrivals, an old family, documentary film crew.

This [[First Encounter]] sets the tone but doesn’t resolve the mystery. That should be easy because at this point you won’t have much more than a vague idea of what the mystery is either.

An example of the plot so [[far]] might be:

*“You’re browsing your monster hunter social media accounts when you see a comment from @Jerry039” (opening line)*

*“Hey dude, you should swing by Epson some time cos I’m pretty sure that [[Weird]] symbol from your second video has been showing up around town. Meet me at the Old School Diner, I’m there every day between 10 and 1.” (hook)*

*“...Nah, we ain’t seen Jerry since 2 days ago. Maybe swing by his old lady’s?” (more hook)*

At this stage you don’t need to know what’s going on—so if they go back to the hotel and break out the shotguns, that’s fine. If they decide to look up local witch stories at the cat museum then that’s fine too.

Or maybe they decide to look for the strange signs themselves. A chill runs down someone’s spine as they notice a spooky figure cloaked in shadow staring at them from an upstairs window. The figure is gone by the time they get into the house but there is a stench and a ritualistic marking on the wall. It’s a map of a nearby lake (*your [[First Encounter]]*).

Of course, you could instead decide that Jerry was just hoaxing them for his stupid paranormal documentary when suddenly everyone in a local retirement home got young again. Either could springboard from that initial setup just as easily.

In the second encounter, [[the hunters]] meet someone or something. Decide if this person is well- or ill-disposed to [[the hunters]]. This person will reveal something about the threat (though maybe not intentionally).

-   **Who?** An authority, an expert, a witness to strange events, a kid, a homeless person, someone with power, a victim, an escaped prisoner, a zombie, a ghost, a cop, a conspiracy theorist, a priest, a pickup artist, an artist, a medium, a scientist, a monster hunter, a victim.

-   Repeat the first and second encounter pattern until you (and [[the hunters]]) have some understanding of the threat. You will know by now that:

-   **It is a:** big, [[small]], smart, [[Sneaky]], old, new, hidden, obvious, tricky, unintelligent, mindless, cunning, powerful, ancient, newly-spawned, transformed, undead, kooky, misunderstood, deceptive, tragic, arrogant.

-   **Monster type:** minion master, behemoth, assassin, creature, spirit, alien, old friend, [[magic]], ally, summoned, possessor, trickster, butcher, mother, serial killer, mutant.

[[The hunters]] better go do something about that! While they make a plan you can take a moment to write up its powers, attacks, and weakness.

-   Be open to anything—don’t think you know the story until the very end.

-   [[Always say]] “Yes.” You can always add “but” afterwards.

-   Look for possibilities.

-   Look for a tie-in with what has already been established.

-   Be obvious—subtlety will not help you.

-   Work with the players to figure out what is going on.

-   Don’t tell the players that you don’t know, or don’t have a plan.
