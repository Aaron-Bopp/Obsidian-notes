# History

When **it’s your turn to describe your relationship with Mike**, pick one of the following:

-   You were there near the beginning of the design work for this game.

-   You admire his work ethic, but his relentless nature unsettles you. Where do you think it comes from?

-   You have a constructive editing relationship: even your (infrequent) disagreements lead to better outcomes.

-   You respect his hard-earned knowledge and often come to him for game design advice.

I’ve been looking back through old internet posts, and I suspect the first time I heard Mike talk about *Monster of the Week* was around 9pm on October 27th, 2007.

![[image11.png]]We were at Fright Night, a one-night-only horror roleplaying convention held in Wellington, New Zealand. Mike had just run *The Infected*, a game by Eric Provost, and as players we were recovering from an intense session involving some hapless eco-tourists trying to outrun fast zombies.

Mike mentioned he wanted to work on a game that covered more than just survival horror. He told me what he was thinking of calling it.

My immediate reactions were:

-   “Of course! That’s brilliant!”, and

-   “If you get this right, it could be one of the go-to games in the monster-hunting genre.”

He also said he’d already written up a few different versions of the

rules.

I nodded, thinking it’d be ready to play by Christmas.

## When you design a game, roll +Grind

Three and half years later, Mike had tested out quite a few more than a ‘few’ different versions of the game. But none of them provided the type of play he wanted: The mechanics didn’t flow; the [[fights]] were too long and clunky.

![[image15.jpg]]While I hadn’t read the rules at this point, I’d played a draft version at a later Fright Night. As usual, I said what I enjoyed, unsuccessfully tried to stop myself offering solutions to fix its rough spots, and told him I’d be happy to playtest it.

My fear, though, was this would be one of those games (every designer has them) that just gets stuck. The core insight, the one that lets you solve the game and make it fun, just never arrives.

Mike didn’t seem frustrated, though. (“Oh, I wish!” said Mike, when I showed him a draft of this foreword.) He just kept revising and testing.

Meanwhile, I realised the two of us had never played an on-going game. In mid-2010, I suggested we could test out the beta version of a new game called Apocalypse World.

## When you first play a game that's Powered by the Apocalypse, roll +Weird

That first contact with *Apocalypse World* was definitely [[Weird]].

As a group, we were figuring out the implications of the rules. How [[Tough]] were our characters? If I got ambushed by four resentful members of my cult, was that a death sentence? How did [[moves]] trigger and who was responsible for noticing it? Did the [[History]] rules make sense? What about advancement? What happens when you change playbooks?

It was glorious. Mike, Sophie, Simon, and I leapt into creating a world that had been fractured into multiple universes, and into conflicts between our characters that had me utterly absorbed.

But for Mike … I don’t know how quickly he figured it out, but he must have been pretty damn excited when he realised how *Apocalypse World* could map on to his monster-hunting game.

We started playing *Apocalypse World* on 3 August 2010.

He started running his own game of *Apocalypse World* about a week and half later.

Then, looking at the official Powered by the Apocalypse forums, I can see the following:

-   Mike designed his first playbook (The Metal Beast, a soldier in powered [[armour]]) on 26 August 2010.

-   He hit his first ‘Ungiven future’ advance in late September 2010 and created his first ‘second character’ (a savvyhead I still have fond memories of).

And then, on November 19, 2010 there’s this post, entitled ‘Monster of the Week—character playbook brainstorming’:

-   “I’m rebuilding my long in creation game *Monster of the Week* as an *Apocalypse World* hack. The game is supposed to get into the zone that *Supernatural* and *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* inhabit.”

-   “It’s going well, but I feel like I need a couple more character types in there.”

I had a pdf copy of “Monster World” in my hands by 6 December 2010.

Just in time for Christmas.

## Game design is a conversation

It took 259 days for the game to go from its first external playtest to being crowdfunded.

It happened fast. Here are a few reasons why:

I ran [[the first session]] for my Tuesday night group, and we got all the way to the end without the rules fundamentally breaking down. That’s a rare mark of success for a game-in-playtest. I’ve only seen it happen two other times (with *Nod* and *Monsterhearts*).

Our Tuesday night group wanted to play a second session (another great sign).

While there was a lot right with the game, there was enough wrong with it that we wanted to give lots of [[feedback]] and write about it online.

Our playtesting and posting generated more interest from other groups. And their playtesting and posting did the same. A positive attention spiral created the two most helpful things in of all in game design: fans and a culture of play.

Mike encouraged people to be creative collaborators. He asked questions about what they found fun, and built new stuff based off their enthusiasm.

And, at the same time, when Mike thought a section of the rules was achieving what he wanted he was great at locking it down. I really admire that quality in him. (Maybe it comes from his extensive experience working on IT projects?)

If you’re interested in hacking *Monster of the Week* or creating your own game, here’s what Mike taught me:

-   Test whether the idea of your game is interesting enough that people ask to play it

-   Put your game out for playtesting before it’s perfect

-   When you find fans, encourage them. Encourage public [[feedback]]. Create a healthy culture where people feel their ideas are valued.

-   Start finalising the game when you think you’re finding a balance between:

-   your vision for what you want out of the game.

-   what other people want out of the game.

-   what the game’s become.

## When you design A Game, your playtesters will tell you what you need

The [[Luck]] rules were a late addition. They came from this comment after our first playtest:

*“Jamie had a little bit of cognitive dissidents: their Wronged character was a badass in their head, but fumbled quite a few rolls.”*

Despite Mike teasing me about the phrase ‘cognitive dissidents’, he hired me to edit the game.

That first playtest was also where I started jotting down notes about how to design a mystery.

Of all our work together, our back-and-forth about how to create mysteries and [[arcs]] in the monster-hunting genre is my favourite memory (and the section I’m most proud of). I’m looking [[forward]] to running (or, hopefully, playing) the mysteries in this collection and to applying the advice about creating mysteries on the fly.

## Once you've filled five Experience boxes, upgrade to a 2nd edition

Mike was the first person I knew in real life who ran a crowdfunding campaign. He handled it with aplomb, remaining calm at all timeswhile figuring out how to print and distribute a book on schedule.

Even better: the game got played.

I had the privilege of watching SAGA (the University of Canterbury’s awesome gaming club), organise a 12-week run of *Monster of the Week*. They gathered about 50 players (many of them new to roleplaying). Dividing into teams of hunters working in a shared universe, they pursued different mysteries (with hunters able to swap teams every week). All of it led into a single coordinated, apocalyptic final confrontation.

We formed a constructive online community on Google Plus (‘The

Monster of the Week Roadhouse’) and the game developed a reputation as a good *Apocalypse World* hack for first-time players.

Fred Hicks’ enthusiasm to make sure the game reached the widest possible audience led to the revised edition in 2015. Fred was great to work with: relaxed and professional.

I was also a huge fan of his process for [[running the game]], especially the new mythology he created (‘The Hungry’) filled with [[monsters]] like the Editors and the Subtractors.

# And now we have this collection

Organised by Mike, it’s filled with contributions from Roadhouse regulars and some of the first-generation Wellington- and Christchurch-based monster-hunters and playtesters.

![[image17.png]]In addition to advice from experienced keepers, this volume fills a big gap in the genre: it provides rules and adventures for *Fringe* and *X-Files* style ‘phenomenon mysteries’. This is my favourite type of mystery: where the antagonist is a problem to solve rather than an entity to beat up or banish.

I hope you enjoy the Tome of Mysteries—Monster: Breeder (motivation: to bring forth evil). May you retire to safety.

P.S.

I’ve had three realisations about running *Monster of the Week*. But first, a warning:

**Be very cautious about introducing two mysteries at the same time .** Solving a mystery is mentally challenging. Players have to learn about the town and its inhabitants. They have to investigate, decide what the monster is, decide what to do about it, and then do it.

Two mysteries are great, as long as you realise it’ll take much longer than normal for your players to categorise the clues and figure out there’s more than one monster.

And now, three things I loved figuring out:

**[[Magic]] doesn’t have to take the form of a spell .** For my latest group, [[magic]] came from creating potions ... and I finally got to use the ‘Potion Miscibility’ tables from *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons*, to find out what happened when a hunter drank two potions at the same time.

**Fred Hicks’ work on The Hungry demonstrated a great thing about creating a custom mythos for your game:** It throws players off-balance. They can’t make any assumptions about how things work (just like the best bits of *Supernatural* Season 7).

Here’s a [[quick]] way to create a mythology. Choose an existential or contemporary dread. What are three ‘vectors’ that would exacerbate or spread that dread? Those are the ‘gods’ or ‘major villains’. Now: what are the reasons each of them would be in opposition to the others? Hopefully this gives you enough [[inspiration]] to create one servitor (a new type of monster) for each god. Finish off by asking yourself “What’s the big secret about this mythos that nobody knows yet?” and you’re good to go.

**You have an unlimited special effects budget in your games .** As part of running a series of cinematic ‘wide-screen’ games, I threw my hunters up against a dragon so enormous it seemed impossible to kill. Conventional [[weapons]] couldn’t hurt it, and [[the hunters]] had to figure out the dragon’s weaknesses during its attacks My favourite thing about that game? Inspired by *Pacific Rim* and *Dragonball Z*, I gave the dragon three different forms. Every time it took a lethal amount of damage, it changed into its next form: tougher, with different stats and [[moves]]. It totally frustrated the players (in the best possible way) and lent an epic feel to the confrontation.
