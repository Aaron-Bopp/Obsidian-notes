I’m going to start by talking a bit about the way to play the game, then remind you of the Keeper **agenda** and **principles**, then discuss how to use them. I will then introduce two more concepts you need: what you should **always say** and the **Keeper moves**. That will give you all the rules you need to run the game. I’ll pull all of this together to explain how to run your mystery on [[0000651300]].
