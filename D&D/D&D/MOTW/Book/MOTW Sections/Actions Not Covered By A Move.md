Sometimes the hunters will come up with something they want to try that isn’t covered by existing moves. Depending on exactly what it is, there are several ways to deal with this.

If the action is something a normal person could do, then you can just accept it. Look at your list of Keeper moves and see if any of them apply to the action: if they do, then use that move. Quite often, I find that the Keeper move that applies is “Ask them what they do next.” Let them do what they want and see what comes of it.

If it’s something that moves the mystery along, and you can’t think of how rolling dice for it will be more interesting than just accepting it, that’s another case where it’s best for them to just do it.

If it’s something that a normal person could do, but it’s really hard and/or dangerous, ask them to **act under pressure**.

If it’s something that a normal person couldn’t do at all, then you can ask them to **use magic**, or **big magic**.

In fact, **act under pressure** and **use magic** are intended to be catch-alls. If you can’t work out which move to use, one of these two will usually work.

Another alternative is to quickly make up a custom move for this particular situation. Only do this if you think it will come up again, and only once you are comfortable enough with the moves that you can do this quickly. There’s a section on making custom moves on [[0000915624]].

On With The Mystery!

That covers the basic rules that you need to keep in mind—it’s time to get on with the mystery. The previous section was a long digression: but if you cast your mind back to “Running the First Mystery” (on [[0000539124]]), the group had just finished creating hunters and were ready to start playing out the mystery. You should have your prepared mystery in front of you.

Start-Of-Mystery Moves

First, check if anyone has a move to roll at the beginning of the mystery. The Chosen always does, and an Expert, Flake, Initiate, or Spooky might have one. Ask them how they do the move. Then have them roll and see what the effect is. Make sure that anyone who rolled six or less marks experience.
