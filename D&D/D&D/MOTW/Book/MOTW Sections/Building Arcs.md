An arc is made up of four basic elements, similar to a mystery. You can create them in any order you want, but I’ll go through them in the order I usually use:

- Basic concept.
- The threats.
- One or more countdowns.
- Optionally, some custom moves.

Arcs work fine without being fully detailed at first. Sometimes you’ll have only a few ideas about what’s going on. That’s fine: just note the details you have now, and fill in others as you think of them. Events in play will suggest further elements to be added in later.
