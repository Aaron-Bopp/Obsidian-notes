Arcs and arc threats may have custom moves, the same as mysteries and mystery threats (the rules for custom moves are on [[0000916117]]). Think about creating custom moves for threats that the hunters will deal with directly, or to highlight special features of the arc.

*For example:*

*This arc relies on the werewolves “recruiting,” so let’s think about how that happens. I don’t want it to be every time you get hurt by a werewolf, maybe it has to be a serious injury?*

***When a werewolf attack causes 4-harm**, you start becoming a werewolf. You’ll be feverish all the time, and suffer random pains. As the full moon approaches, you’ll have sharper senses (especially smell, hearing, and night vision) and crave raw, bloody meat. The transformation may be stopped by a big magic ritual, or treatment with silver (anything that will affect the whole body, such as colloidal silver capsules, will do). If not cured by the next full moon, you’ll transform and it will be too late to save you: change your playbook to Monstrous. Note that almost no bystanders who suffer such a werewolf attack will be able to cure it, so they will almost all be turned.*

Summary: Arc Creation

- Come up with a basic concept: a long-term evil plot that threatens the hunters or the world.
- Create the threats for the arc, using the rules for mystery threats.
- Create a countdown for the arc.
- As you play, add more details to the arc based on what happens in each related mystery.
- Advance the arc countdown when the hunters do not stop the evil plan.

Between Game Sessions: Subsequent Mysteries

The process for creating subsequent mysteries is much the same as when you create the first one. I’ll summarize the process again here, and then explain what you need to do differently.

Summary:

Mystery Creation

- Come up with a basic concept: a cool monster, mystery idea, or something inspired by a previous mystery or by your arcs.
- Create a hook: the clue that caught the hunters’ attention.
- Create the monster(s): name, description, type and motivation, define powers, weaknesses, attacks, armour, harm capacity.
- Create the minions (if any): name, description, type and motivation, define powers, weaknesses, attacks, armour, harm capacity.
- Create the bystanders: name, description, type and motivation.
- Create the locations: name, description, type and motivation.
- Define the mystery countdown: six terrible events that would occur if the hunters never came.
- Create any custom moves required for these threats, or the mystery as a whole.
