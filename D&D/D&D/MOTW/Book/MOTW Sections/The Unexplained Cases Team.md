The Agency needs a team to handle all the weird stuff regular agents don’t understand. That’s you: the Unexplained Cases Team. You check out the mysterious disappearances, the fungus monsters, the alien abductions, the vampires and everything else the regular agents can’t handle.

This team concept requires a Professional. A Flake, Mundane, Expert, Spooky, and Wronged would all be good choices to fill out the team’s skill profile, while a Crooked might have some useful contacts.

The Professional’s Agency will employ the whole team. As a customisation, allow any of the hunters to take the Professional’s **deal with the Agency** move as a leveling up option ([[0000251869]]). Until then, they’re just consultants, contractors, or temps.
