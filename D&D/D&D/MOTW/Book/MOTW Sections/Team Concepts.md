It’s good to work out why the hunters formed their team. You may have decided on this already. If not, have a quick discussion and see if you come up with an idea—even if it’s just a vague one.

The combination of playbooks you’ve selected may demand a particular team concept. Or it may seem like two (or more) teams of hunters have been mashed together (for instance, a family and a government agency)—in which case, it’s good to ask yourselves why they’re co-operating.

If nobody has any ideas, you can either work it out later on (after you have all made your hunters, and figured out your history together), or you can accept that this is a random collection of hunters: sometimes it’s okay to let things develop in play.

Don’t set your concept in stone yet. You’ll want to revise it as you make up your hunters, based on the choices you make along the way.

Team Customization

Sometimes your team concept will require additional stuff on top of the normal character creation options. This is stuff that enables the game to run smoothly. If you find yourselves saying, “It doesn’t make sense that we don’t have this,” and everyone agrees, then it’s a good candidate for customisation.

Decide as a group if any changes are needed, and what they will be. You can work these out at any point: it might come up right away when you pick your concept, or you might think of it later on.

Your concept might require:

- Equipment that isn’t in your playbook options. For example: your team concept has the hunters always on the move, but none of your playbooks include transport in the gear section. You can decide the team has a van to travel in.
- Something that can be written up as a custom move ([[0000915624]]). For example: the team concept is that you are all members of a secret organisation, so everyone starts with a version of the Professional’s **deal with the Agency** move ([[0000236873]]).
- New options when you level up ([[Leveling Up]]). For example: the team concept has a special mystical artifact for each hunter, but these artifacts’ powers are not initially available. Each hunter may choose to unlock one of their artifact’s powers when they level up.
