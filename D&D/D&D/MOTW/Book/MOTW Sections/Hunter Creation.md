Your first task is to guide the other players through the process of creating their hunters.

Introduce the idea of team concepts ([[Team Concepts]]). Help the group come up with a concept that gets them all excited. If nobody thinks of an exciting concept now, you can wait until later to work that out (wait until after they’ve decided on their hunters’ histories with each other).

Next, allocate hunter playbooks. It’s perfectly reasonable to limit the hunter types available if you have a particular style in mind for your game. This can also speed up hunter creation, as there are fewer decisions to make.

If the team has a concept that requires certain playbooks, have people choose from those first. Otherwise, just let everyone have a quick look at each and grab the one they like the look of. If anyone is having trouble, ask them what sort of hunter they would like and you can suggest which playbooks suit that idea.

Then get everyone to follow the instructions in their playbook up to “Introductions.” Be ready to answer any questions, and watch for anyone who seems to be having trouble. You can help them work out what moves or options will best fit their idea of the hunter. Put some questions to the whole group, too, and get everyone’s input. If people seem to be getting bogged down, tell them to just choose what seems coolest now as they’ll have a chance to revise things after you play your first session out.

As everyone gets close to done, go around those who’ve finished, find out what they’ve picked, and point out any implications you can see from their choices. For example, there might be a mismatch between the ratings they picked and what they need to roll for their moves, or a possible duplication of abilities with the other hunters. That sort of thing isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s worth thinking about whether they really want to do it.
