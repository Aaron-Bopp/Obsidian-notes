*Everything’s connected. But not everyone can see the patterns, and most people don’t even look that hard.*

*But me, I can never stop looking deeper. I can never stop seeing the truth.*

*I spot the patterns. That’s how I found the monsters, and that’s how I help kill them.*

To make your Flake, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

![](MotWIMG9.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, transgressive, concealed.
- Wild eyes, moving eyes, focused eyes, searching eyes, suspicious eyes, wide eyes, guarded eyes.
- Ratty clothes, casual clothes, rumpled suit, neat clothes, comfortable clothes, army surplus gear.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm+1, Cool+1, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird=0
- Charm=0, Cool+1, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird+1
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough+1, Weird=0
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird+1
- Charm-1, Cool-1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird+2

**MOVES**

*You get all of the basic moves, plus pick three Flake moves:*

- **Connect the Dots**: At the beginning of each mystery, if **you look for the wider patterns** that current events might be part of, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. Spend your hold during the mystery to ask the Keeper any one of the following questions: 
  - *Is this person connected to current events more than they are saying?*
  - *When and where will the next critical event occur?*
  - *What does the monster want from this person?*
  - *Is this connected to previous mysteries we have investigated?*
  - *How does this mystery connect to the bigger picture?*
- **Crazy Eyes**: You get +1 Weird (max +3).
- **See, It All Fits Together**: You can use Sharp instead of Charm when you **manipulate someone**.
- **Suspicious Mind**: If someone lies to you, you know it.
- **Often Overlooked**: When **you** **act all crazy** to avoid something, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you’re regarded as unthreatening and unimportant. On a 7-9, pick one: unthreatening or unimportant. On a miss, you draw lots (but not all) of the attention.
- **Contrary**: When **you seek out and receive someone’s honest advice** on the best course of action for you and then do something else instead, mark experience. If you do exactly the opposite of their advice, you also take +1 ongoing on any moves you make pursuing that course.
- **Net Friends**: You know a lot of people on the Internet. When **you** **contact a net friend to help you** with a mystery, roll +Charm. On a 10+, they’re available and helpful—they can fix something, break a code, hack a computer, or get you some special information. On a 7-9, they’re prepared to help, but it’s either going to take some time or you’re going to have to do part of it yourself. On a miss, you burn some bridges.
- **Sneaky**: When **you attack from ambush, or from behind**, inflict +2 harm.

**GEAR**

You get one normal weapon and two hidden weapons.

Normal weapons (pick one):

- .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-harm close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud)
- Magnum (3-harm close reload loud)
- Shotgun (3-harm close messy loud)
- Big knife (1-harm hand)

Hidden weapons (pick two):

- Throwing knives (1-harm close many)
- Holdout pistol (2-harm close loud reload)
- Garrote (3-harm intimate)
- Watchman’s flashlight (1-harm hand)
- Weighted gloves/brass knuckles (1-harm hand)
- Butterfly knife/folding knife (1-harm hand)

**INTRODUCTIONS**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Flake by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**HISTORY**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- They’re somehow tied into it all. You’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- They’re a close relative. Ask them to decide exactly what.
- Old friends, who originally met through a long chain of coincidences.
- You went through hell together: maybe a monster, maybe military service, maybe time in an institution. Whatever it was, it bound you together, and you have total trust in each other.
- Members of the same support group.
- Fellow freaks.
- The signs all pointed to working together. So you found them and now you work together.
- You know each other through cryptozoology and conspiracy theory websites.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-harm, no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**HARM**

When you suffer harm, mark off the number of boxes equal to harm suffered. When you reach four harm, tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**LEVELING UP**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 Sharp, max +3
- Get +1 Charm, max +2
- Get +1 Cool, max +2

- Take another Flake move

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.

[[The Initiate]]


[[The Monstrous]]

*I feel the hunger, the lust to destroy. But I fight it: I never give in. I’m not human any more, not really, but I have to protect those who still are. That way I can tell myself I’m different to the other monsters. Sometimes I can even believe it.*

To make your Monstrous, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, breed, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

- Man, woman, mysterious, transgressive.
- Sinister aura, powerful aura, dark aura, unnerving aura, energetic aura, evil aura, bestial aura.

**BREED**

You’re half-human, half-monster: decide if you were always this way or if you you were originally human and transformed somehow.

Now decide if you were always fighting to be good, or if you were evil and changed sides.

Define your monstrous breed by picking a curse, moves, and natural attacks.

Create the monster you want to be: whatever you choose defines your breed in the game. Some classic monsters with suggestions for picks are listed below. These are *only* suggestions: feel free to make a different version!

**MONSTER BREED SUGGESTIONS**

- **Vampire**: *Curse*: [[feed]] (blood or life-force). *Natural attacks*: Base: life-drain or Base: teeth; add +1 harm to base attack. *Moves*: [[immortal]] or [[unquenchable vitality]]; mental domination.
- **Werewolf**: *Curse*: [[vulnerability]] (silver). *Natural attacks*: Base: claws; Base: teeth. *Moves*: [[shapeshifter]] (wolf and/or wolfman); [[claws of the beast]] or [[unholy strength]].

- **Vulnerability**: Pick a substance. You suffer +1 harm when you suffer harm from it. If you are bound or surrounded by it, you must **act under pressure** to use your powers.
- **Pure Drive**: One emotion rules you. Pick from: hunger, hate, anger, fear, jealousy, greed, joy, pride, envy, lust, or cruelty. Whenever you have a chance to indulge that emotion, you must do so immediately, or **act under pressure** to resist.
- **Dark Master**: You have an evil lord who doesn’t know you changed sides. They still give you orders, and they do not tolerate refusal. Or failure.

**NATURAL ATTACKS**

*Pick a Base and add an extra to it, or two Bases.*

- Base: teeth (3-harm intimate)
- Base: claws (2-harm hand)
- Base: magical force (1-harm magical close)

- **Immortal**: You do not age or sicken, and whenever you suffer harm you suffer 1-harm less.
- **Unnatural Appeal**: Roll +Weird instead of +Charm when you **manipulate someone**.
- **Unholy Strength**: Roll +Weird instead of +Tough when you **kick some ass**.
- **Incorporeal**: You may move freely through solid objects (but not people).
- **Preternatural Speed**: You go much faster than normal people. **When you chase, flee, or run** take +1 ongoing.
- **Claws of the Beast**: All your natural attacks get +1 harm.
- **Mental Dominion**: When you gaze into a normal human’s eyes and **exert your will over them**, roll +Charm. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold to give them an order. Regular people will follow your order, whatever it is. Hunters can choose whether they do it or not. If they do, they mark experience.
- **Unquenchable Vitality**: When you have taken harm, **you can heal yourself**. Roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a 7-9, heal 1-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a miss, your injuries worsen.
- **Dark Negotiator**: You can use the **manipulate someone** move on monsters as well as people, if they can reason and talk.

**HISTORY**

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- You lost control one time, and almost killed them. Ask them how they stopped you.
- They tried to slay you, but you proved you’re on the side of good. Ask them what convinced them.
- You are romantically obsessed with them. Ask them if they know, and if they reciprocate.
- Close relations, or a distant descendant. Tell them which.
- You saved them from another of your kind, and prevented reprisals against that individual creature (maybe it’s another good one, or maybe it has a hold over you).
- They are tied to your curse or origin. Tell them how.
- You fought together against the odds, and prevailed.
- They saved you from another hunter who was prepared to kill you. Ask them what happened.

**LUCK**
