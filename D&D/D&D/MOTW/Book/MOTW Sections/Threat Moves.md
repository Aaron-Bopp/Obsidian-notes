Each type of threat has its own set of [[special moves]] it can make. Use these as well as the basic Keeper moves when you’re describing what a threat is doing.

Threat moves are used in the same way as the basic Keeper moves, except that a particular threat has to be the source of the move.

Monster Threat Moves

Monsters get fourteen moves:

- Hint at its presence
- Display its full might
- Appear suddenly
- Attack with great force and fury
- Seize someone or something
- Attack with stealth and calculation
- Order underlings to do terrible acts
- Destroy something
- Escape, no matter how well contained it is
- Give chase
- Return to home ground
- Boast and gloat, maybe revealing a secret
- Return from seeming destruction
- Use an unnatural power

**USING MONSTERS**

Monsters are the key threat type, always there in the shadows, behind everything bad that is happening. They should be dangerous and scary, but also remote at first. Let the monster be revealed slowly, as the hunters close in. This will be matched by the hunters gradually learning about the monster’s powers and weaknesses.

Don’t be afraid to use the monster threat moves to get it out of trouble, either. Especially in cases where the hunters track it down early in the mystery, you can let it escape for the time being, allowing it (and the hunters) a chance to rest and regroup.

Finally, it will likely come down to a fight between the hunters and the monster. This is the chance to throw everything at them: use all its unnatural powers, gloat, and generally make the final fight as tough and exciting as possible.

Minion Threat Moves

Minions get eleven moves:

- A burst of sudden, uncontrolled violence
- Make a coordinated attack
- Capture someone, or steal something
- Reveal a secret
- Deliver someone or something to the master
- Give chase
- Make a threat or demand on behalf of the master
- Run away
- Use an unnatural power
- Display a hint of conscience or humanity
- Disobey the master, in some petty way

**USING MINIONS**

Minions are there to support and guard the monster. While monsters should be kept at a distance to start with, it’s fine for minions to be noticed and fought early in the mystery.

Minions can also be used to build up tension, giving the hunters a feeling of being surrounded by danger, or of constantly being watched.

Don’t have minions always fight to the death: they can flee, surrender, or offer a deal to be left alive or betray their master. This is especially true for human minions.

Bystander Threat Moves

Bystanders get ten moves:

- Go off alone
- Argue with the hunters
- Get in the way
- Reveal something
- Confess their fears
- Freak out in terror
- Try to help the hunters
- Try to protect people
- Display inability or incompetence
- Seek help or comfort

**USING BYSTANDERS**

Bystanders don’t normally intend to cause trouble for the hunters, but they do so anyway. Think of each bystander as a person who wants one simple thing (which is represented by their motivation). A **victim** might want to just stay in his apartment, whatever the hunters say is coming. An **official** might just want to finish the paperwork and be done with this case, without dealing with any crazy hunters.

When thinking about bystander moves, consider the bystander’s motivation, and what dumb thing they could do that will lead to trouble for the hunters. What can the bystander complicate for the hunters? How can they get in the way? This applies even when the bystander helps the hunters: this will give the hunters extra problems, starting with keeping the helper alive.

Bystander motivations are not always things that immediately lead to trouble. For example:

A **witness** is motivated to reveal information. Although when you reveal information to a hunter, that does tend to lead to trouble: telling the hunters where to find a monster usually leads to them going to fight it! Witnesses might also give the hunters too much information, or tell them something incomplete or just plain wrong.

A **helper** can easily create trouble despite wanting to help the hunters, just by giving the hunter someone to look after. Or consider a helper who tries to lure the monster towards the hunters.

An **innocent**, wanting to do the right thing, can cause trouble by insisting that the authorities get involved, or by telling people the whole truth at an inopportune time.

Any normal person the hunters talk to should be given a name and threat type, almost always a bystander type. If you have no particular idea what their role in the story is going to be, default to **witness** if they might have some clues for the hunters, or **victim** otherwise.

Location Threat Moves

Locations get eleven moves:

- Present a hazard
- Reveal something
- Hide something
- Close a way
- Open a way
- Reshape itself
- Trap someone
- Offer a guide
- Present a guardian
- Something doesn’t work properly
- Create a particular feeling

**USING LOCATION THREATS**

Locations normally don’t have intentions in the way that monsters, minions and bystanders do. Instead they stand in for things that go wrong around the hunters, due to hazards in the environment. For example, in a **maze**, an exit door could get jammed, or the GPS in the hunters’ car might start glitching out.

Location threat moves give you ways to move the mystery along, or put obstacles in the way of the hunters. They’re useful to pace the mystery as it plays out—to slow the progress down, or speed it up. The moves also work well when there’s action, to keep things exciting.

The Basic Hunter Moves

The earlier description of the basic hunter moves (on [[The Basic Moves]]) is written from the hunters’ point of view. Here’s some extra information about the moves from the Keeper’s point of view.
