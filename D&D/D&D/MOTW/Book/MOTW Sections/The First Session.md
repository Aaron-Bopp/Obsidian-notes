In the first session, you’ll create your hunters and investigate your first mystery.

The first step is to decide if the group wants to pick a team concept ([[Team Concepts]]). That’s the reason you are a team, for example, “We all work for a secret monster hunting agency” or “We defend our home town against the monsters that keep coming here.” The Keeper may have some suggestions based on what they’ve been planning.

If you have a team concept that needs certain hunter types, allocate those first.

If you don’t have a team concept, just let everyone pick a playbook (that’s your hunter rules and record sheet) and see what the team looks like. You’ll work out why they are together as you create your hunters, establish their history with each other, and as you play the game.

The hunter types are:

- **The Chosen**: a once-ordinary person who discovered they have a special destiny, and who has been given the power to accomplish it. The Chosen is good in a fight, with some weird powers. E.g. Buffy from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer.* See [[0000068181]].
- **The Crooked**: a criminal turned monster hunter, haunted by their past and enemies. The Crooked is good in social situations and has a lot of contacts. E.g. Anna Valmont from *The Dresden Files*, Peter Bishop from *Fringe*. See [[The Crooked]].
- **The Divine**: an agent of a higher power, with a mission to fulfill. The Divine is very tough and has been granted holy powers. E.g. Castiel from *Supernatural*; Michael Carpenter from *The Dresden Files*. See [[The Divine]].
- **The Expert**: the hunter who knows all about monsters and magic. The Expert knows a lot of hidden secrets and how to find out more, and also has a well-supplied base to work from. E.g. Bobby Singer from *Supernatural*; Rupert Giles from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Expert]].
- **The Flake**: a conspiracy theorist. The Flake is great at finding things out and seeing how the events of separate mysteries are connected. E.g. Agent Mulder or the Lone Gunmen from *The* *X-Files*. See [[The Flake]].
- **The Initiate**: a member of an ancient monster-slaying Sect, trained to fight and use magic[[The Initiate]] is good with magic, and their Sect provides help (and sometimes problems). E.g. The Wardens from *The Dresden Files*; Annelise from the *Twenty Palaces* series. See [[The Initiate]].
- **The Monstrous**: a monster fighting for the good guys. [[The Monstrous]] is very weird, and can have a variety of different powers based on what monster breed they are. E.g. Angel from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and *Angel*; Bill Compton from *True Blood* ([[0000189800]]).
- **The Mundane**: just a normal regular person, especially good at dealing with regular people you meet and have to save, and at getting captured by monsters (which can be more useful than you might expect). E.g. Xander or Cordelia from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Mundane]].
- **The Professional**: you work for an agency that hunts monsters. The Professional is good in a fight, and a good team player. E.g. Riley and the Initiative from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*; Olivia Dunham from *Fringe*. See [[The Professional]].
- **The Spell-slinger**: a trained wizard, wielding powerful magic in their crusade against evil. The Spell-slinger’s arcane training gives them an advantage when dealing with eldritch secrets. E.g. Harry Dresden from *The Dresden Files*; Willow from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, in the later seasons. See [[The Spell-Slinger]].
- **The Spooky**: has psychic or magical powers. These powers are strange and sinister ... and not completely under the Spooky’s control. E.g. Sam Winchester from *Supernatural*; Willow from earlier seasons of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Spooky]].
- **The Wronged**: revenge-driven, and really tough. The Wronged is all about killing a specific breed of monster and protecting others as you do it. E.g. Dean and John Winchester from *Supernatural*. See [[0000295092]].

[[Extra hunter types]]

Getting everyone into a room to play is the next step.

I’m going to assume that you get all the saying, “Hi,” and getting snacks and drinks and catching up out of the way first. I’ll tell you about the game stuff you need to do.
