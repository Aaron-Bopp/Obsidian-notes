All the hunters have a set of moves that allow them to investigate and deal with monsters. These are called the “basic moves” ([[The Basic Moves]]). There are eight basic moves:

- **Act Under Pressure**, used for any difficult or dangerous action that isn’t covered by another move.
- **Help Out**, used to help another hunter do something. If you succeed, you’ll give them a bonus on their task.
- **Investigate a Mystery**, used to work out what kind of monster you are dealing with, what it can do, and what it’s planning.
- **Kick Some Ass**, used for fighting. Fighting monsters, mainly.
- **Manipulate Someone**, used to try and get someone to do something for you, after you give them some kind of reason.
- **Protect Someone**, used to save someone from danger.
- **Read a Bad Situation**, used to work out what dangers are immediately threatening you. For instance, if you think you are walking into a trap, or want to do some tactical analysis.
- **Use Magic**, used to cast magic spells or use enchanted items.

In addition, each hunter playbook has its own set of moves. These are called “playbook moves.”
