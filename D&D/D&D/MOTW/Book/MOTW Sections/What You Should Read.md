I’ve written the rulebook in the order that you’ll need as you play, with all the hunters’ information first and then the Keeper’s section after.

If you want to skip that and just hit the basics, here’s some suggestions:

- If you’re going to be Keeper, focus on the First Session section ([[0000532383]]): that covers what you need to prepare and what to do for the first game. It’s best to know the hunters’ basic moves ([[0000589979]]) and playbooks (from [[The Playbooks]]), at least in passing
- If you’re going to play a hunter, read the hunter playbooks (from [[The Playbooks]]), and about moves ([[The Basic Moves]]) and ratings ([[The Ratings]]). Most important is to pick which hunter type(s) you want to play.
- If you’ve played *Apocalypse World* (or another game based on those rules, such as *Monsterhearts* or *Dungeon World*) then plenty here will be familiar. Check out ratings (stats in *Apocalypse World*) ([[The Ratings]]), playbooks ([[The Playbooks]]), and basic moves ([[The Basic Moves]]) to get a sense of the main differences. Luck is new ([[The Luck Counter]]). The Keeper’s (MC in *Apocalypse World*) agenda and principles ([[The Keeper Agenda]]), threats ([[0000465043]]), and moves ([[0000559527]]) are different, and mysteries ([[Creating Your First Mystery]] & [[0000764334]]) and arcs ([[0000741446]]) take the place of fronts.
- If you’re an experienced roleplayer who hasn’t played *Apocalypse World* (the game these rules are adapted from), check out the hunter playbooks ([[The Playbooks]]) and the moves ([[The Basic Moves]]) and ratings ([[The Ratings]]). From there everything else should fall into place.
- If you want to run a game right away, skim “Running the First Mystery” ([[0000539124]]) and “On With the Mystery” ([[0000651380]]) and then read through “Dream Away the Time” on [[Introductory Mystery: Dream Away the Time]]. That should be enough to get you up and running. You can come back for more detail later.
