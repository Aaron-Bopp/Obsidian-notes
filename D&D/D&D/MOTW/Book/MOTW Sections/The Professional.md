*It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down monsters. Still, that’s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”*

To make your Professional, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Agency, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

![](MotWIMG13.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, concealed.
- Chiseled face, scarred face, unshaven face, soft face, young face, old face, determined face.
- Tailored suit, shabby suit, perfect suit, utility coveralls, battledress, paramilitary uniform, lab coat.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm=0, Cool+2, Sharp-1, Tough+2, Weird-1
- Charm-1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird=0
- Charm+1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird=0
- Charm-1, Cool+2, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+1
- Charm=0, Cool+2, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird-1

**AGENCY**

Decide who it is you work for. Are they a black-budget government department, a secret military unit, a clandestine police team, a private individual’s crusade, a corporation, a scientific team, or what?

Is the Agency’s goal to: destroy monsters, study the supernatural, protect people, gain power, or something else?

Pick two resource tags for the Agency, and two red tape tags:

**Resources** (pick two):

- Well-armed
- Well-financed
- Rigorous training
- Official pull
- Cover identities
- Offices all over the place
- Good intel
- Recognised authority
- Weird tech gadgets
- Support teams

**Red Tape** (pick two):

- Dubious motives
- Bureaucratic
- Secretive hierarchy
- Cryptic missions
- Hostile superiors
- Inter-departmental rivalry
- Budget cuts
- Take no prisoners policy
- Live capture policy

**MOVES**

*You get all the basic moves, plus four Professional moves.*

*You get this one:*

- When you **deal with the Agency,** requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.

*Then pick three of these:*

- **Bottle It Up**: If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you **act under pressure**. For each +1 you use, the Keeper holds 1. That hold can be spent later—one for one—to give you -1 on any move *except* **act under pressure**.
- **Unfazeable**: Take +1 Cool (max +3).
- **Battlefield Awareness**: You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever you get from your gear.
- **Leave No One Behind**: In combat, when **you help someone escape**, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can *either* get them out *or* suffer no harm, you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention.
- **Tactical Genius**: When you **read a bad situation**, you may roll +Cool instead of +Sharp
- **Medic**: You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. **When you do first aid**, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 harm. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 harm or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 harm. This move takes the place of regular first aid.
- **Mobility**: You have a truck, van, or car built for monster hunting. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it. 

*Good things*: roomy; surveillance gear; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed weapons; anonymous; armoured (+1 armour inside); tough; monster cage.

*Bad things*: loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-

guzzler; uncomfortable; slow; old.

**GEAR**

Pick one serious weapon and two normal weapons.

You get *either* a flak vest (1-armour hidden) *or* combat armour (2-armour heavy) for protection.

Serious weapons (pick one):

- Assault rifle (3-harm far area loud reload)
- Grenade launcher (4-harm far area messy loud reload)
- Sniper rifle (4-harm far)
- Grenades (4-harm close area messy loud)
- Submachine gun (3-harm close area loud reload)

Normal weapons (pick two):

- .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-harm close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud)
- Shotgun (3-harm close messy)
- Big knife (1-harm hand)

**INTRODUCTIONS**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Professional by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**HISTORY**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- Your relationship with them has romantic potential. So far it hasn’t gone further.
- They’re on the Agency’s watch list, and you’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- You are related. Tell them how close.
- You met on a mission and worked together unofficially. And successfully.
- They’ve worked with the Agency before, and they’re well regarded.
- You were friends back in training, before the Agency recruited you. This could be military, law enforcement, or some weirder school: decide the details between you.
- They pulled you (and maybe your team) out of a terrible FUBARed mission.
- You got sent to “deal with them” as a hazard to the Agency’s policies one time. Tell them how you resolved this.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-harm, no matter how bad it was. If all your Luck boxes get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**HARM**

When you suffer harm, mark off the number of boxes equal to harm suffered. When you reach four harm, tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**LEVELING UP**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 Cool, max +3
- Get +1 Charm, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Get +1 Tough, max +2
- Take another Professional move
- Take another Professional move
- Add a new resource tag for your Agency *or* change a red tape tag
- Get command of an Agency team of monster hunters
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- Get some or all of the other players’ hunters hired by your agency. They get the **deal with the agency** move, as well as salary and benefits.



The Spell-Slinger

*Fight fire with **fire magic**.*

To make your Spell-slinger, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, Combat Magic, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

![](MotWIMG14.jpeg)

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Woman, man, androgynous.
- Rumpled clothes, stylish clothes, goth clothes, old fashioned clothes.
- Shadowed eyes, fierce eyes, weary eyes, sparkling eyes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm-1, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool-1, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird+2
- Charm-1, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough-1, Weird+2
- Charm=0, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird+2

**COMBAT MAGIC**

You have a few attack spells you can use as weapons. When you use these spells to **kick some ass**, roll +Weird instead of +Tough. Sometimes the situation may require you to **act under pressure** to cast your spell without problems.

Pick three options from the list below.

Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells with any of your effects.

Combat magic, pick three (with at least one base):

**Bases:**

- **Blast**: 2-harm magical close obvious loud
- **Ball**: 1-harm magical area close obvious loud
- **Missile**: 1-harm magical far obvious loud
- **Wall**: 1-harm magical barrier close 1-armour obvious loud

**Effects:**

- **Fire**: Add “+2 harm fire” to a base. If you get a 10+ on a combat magic roll, the fire won’t spread.
- **Force or Wind**: Add “+1 harm forceful” to a base, or “+1 armour” to a wall.
- **Lightning or Entropy**: Add “+1 harm messy” to a base.
- **Frost or Ice**: Adds “-1 harm +2 armour” to a wall, or “+1 harm restraining” to other bases.
- **Earth**: Add “forceful restraining” to a base.
- **Necromantic**: Add “life-drain” to a base.

**MOVES**

You get all the basic moves and four Spell-slinger moves. You have this one:

- **Tools and Techniques**: In order to use your combat magic effectively, you rely on a collection of tools and techniques. If you don’t use them, there are drawbacks. Cross off one; you’ll need the rest.
- **Consumables**: You need to have certain supplies— powders, oils, etc— on hand to cast your spell. They’re used up when you cast the spell. If you don’t have them on hand, your body will be the substitute: take 1-harm ignore-armour when you cast.
- **Foci**: You need wands, staves, and other somewhat obvious props to focus your efforts at their most powerful. If you don’t have what you need on hand, your combat magic does 1 less harm.
- **Gestures**: You need to be able to wave your hands around obviously in order to use your combat magic. If you’re restrained in any way, you can still cast the spell but it’s more likely to go wrong; take -1 ongoing to your combat magic.
- **Incantations**: You must speak in an arcane language to control your magic without it filtering directly through your mind. If you use combat magic spell, successfully or failed, while unable or unwilling to speak, you must immediately **act under pressure** to avoid scrambling your thoughts—producing hallucinations, sensory deprivation, and general befuddlement.

Plus pick three of these:

- **Advanced Arcane Training**: If you have two of your three Tools and Techniques at the ready, you may ignore the third one.
- **Arcane Reputation**: Pick three big organizations or groups in the supernatural community, which can include some of the more sociable types of monsters. They’ve heard of you and respect your power. With affected humans, take +1 forward when you **manipulate** them. You may **manipulate** affected monsters as if they were human, with no bonus.
- **Could’ve Been Worse**: When you miss a **use magic** roll you can choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic: 
  - **Fizzle**: The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You’ll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.
  - **This Is Gonna Suck**: The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.
- **Enchanted Clothing**: Pick an article of every-day clothing–it’s enchanted without any change in appearance. Take -1 harm from any source that tries to get at you through the garment.
- **Forensic Divination**: When you successfully **investigate a mystery**, you may ask “What magic was done here?” as a free extra question.
- **Go Big or Go Home**: When you must **use magic** as a requirement for Big Magic, take +1 ongoing to those **use magic** rolls.
- **Not My Fault**: +1 to **act under pressure** when you are dealing with the consequences of your own spellcasting.
- **Practitioner**: Choose two effects available to you under **use magic**. Take +1 to **use magic** whenever you choose one of those effects.
- **Shield Spell**: When you **protect someone**, gain 2-armour against any harm that is transferred to you. This doesn’t stack with your other armour, if any.
- **Third Eye**: When you **read a bad situation**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 hold on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you’re exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!

**GEAR**

You don’t need much—aside from any foci or consumables to power your magic. Still, it’s good to carry some backup. Pick one:

- Old revolver (2-harm close reload loud)
- Ritual knife (1-harm hand)
- Heirloom sword (2-harm hand messy)

**INTRODUCTIONS**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Spell-slinger by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**HISTORY**

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They act as your conscience when the power goes to your head. Ask them about the last time this happened.
- Blood relation, though you were out of contact for years. Ask them how they reconnected with you.
- Mentor from another life. Ask them what they taught you.
- Your magic-fueled rescue of them introduced them to the supernatural. Tell them what creature was after them.
- An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship. Tell them what you once fought over.
- You thought they were dead, and now they’re back. What “killed” them?
- They’re an on-again/off-again love interest. Ask them what keeps you apart. Tell them what keeps you together.
- A comrade-in-arms. You’ve faced the biggest threats together.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-harm, no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**HARM**

When you suffer harm, mark off the number of boxes equal to harm suffered. When you reach four harm, tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**LEVELING UP**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:
