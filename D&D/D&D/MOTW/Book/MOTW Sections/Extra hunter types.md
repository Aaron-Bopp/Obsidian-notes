There are some extra playbooks out there, some official and others fan-made. You can find advice on making your own on [[0000935239]].

The currently available hunters include:

- **The Action Scientist**. Just like it says, a scientist ready for action and dealing with monsters. Directly inspired by *Atomic Robo*.
- **The Big Game Hunter**. An expert hunter who has decided to hunt monsters for the thrill of the chase rather than the need to protect.
- **The Constructed**. A built being, now free of its maker. Inspired by Frankenstein’s monster.
- **The Exile**. A monster hunter from the past who has been transported to the present day.
- **The Hard Case**. The toughest, hardest to kill fighter. E.g. Ray Lilly from the *Twenty Palaces* series or Owen Pitt from the *Monster Hunter International* series.
- **The Luchador**. A heroic masked wrestler, fighting to protect the innocent between matches.
- **The Mad Scientist**. A crazy scientist who has seen the error of their ways and is now working for good. So they say, anyhow.
- **The Meddling Kid**. Jinkies! I think there’s something more going on here, and old man Smithers seems to be involved! E.g. Scooby-doo and the Scooby gang.
- **The Sidekick**. They worship another hunter on the team, and is good at helping them out. And one day, they’ll be just as good as their hero. E.g. Garth from *Supernatural*.
- **The Snoop**. A journalist looking for the real story behind weird events. Great at finding stuff out, terrible at fighting. E.g. The Ghostfacers from *Supernatural*.
- **The Summoned**. A creature summoned to end the world but who has decided they do not want to do that. Lots of weird powers, dangerous, and hard to kill. E.g. *Hellboy*.

Most of these are available on the *Monster of the Week* website.
