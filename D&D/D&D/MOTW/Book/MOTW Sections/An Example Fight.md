This illustrates some of the techniques I’ve outlined above, demonstrating how it works in play.

Our cast is:

- Alan, the Keeper, playing (variously): Jerry Parsons, a bystander, and Lucius, a vampire (already on 3-harm from an earlier encounter).
- Mary, playing Mark (a Wronged hunter)
- Chris, playing Cray (a Spooky hunter)
- The house is a location: deathtrap (motivation: to harm intruders).

*Mark and Cray are pursuing a vampire. They’ve tracked it to a disused house, and* **manipulated** *the caretaker, Jerry, to let them in.*

**Alan:** *Jerry leads you into the house, shining a flashlight around. The place is full of furniture covered in sheets to keep the dust off.*

**Alan** (speaking as Jerry): *“The place seems like I left it—um, I don’t think anyone’s been in here.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“We’re sure it... ah, he came this way. Probably best you leave us to it now.”*

**Alan:** *The door swings shut with a slam.*

*Alan used the location move* **close a path***.*

**Alan:** *At the same moment you notice a trail in the dust—someone has been coming and going here recently. Cray, there are three ways out of the hallway—into the house, left into a family room or lounge, and right into what was maybe a study. There’s a flicker of movement in the study. Jerry is walking down the hall shining his flashlight around.*

*Alan used the Keeper move* **announce future badness***. He then sketches a map of the hallway and adjoining rooms.*

**Alan** (speaking as Jerry): *“Did you hear that?”*

**Chris:** *Cray’s going to check out the study.*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“Hey Mark, watch my back!”*

**Alan:** *Are you* ***reading a bad situation**?*

**Chris:** *I sure am.*

*Chris rolls the dice and adds Cray’s Sharp.*

**Chris:** *I got... eight. Let me see... any dangers we haven’t noticed?*

**Alan:** *The only things moving in here are you guys and whatever’s in the study.*

**Chris:** *Okay, it clearly knows we’re here.*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“Show yourself you unholy bastard!”*

**Alan:** *Are you stepping into the room?*

**Chris:** *Yes, but slowly.*

**Mary:** *Mark’s covering him with the rifle.*

**Alan:** *There’s a swirl of shadow and the vampire takes form directly in front of you.*

*Alan used the monster move* **appear suddenly***.*

**Chris:** *I already have my magnum out, okay?*

**Alan:** *Sure.*

*Although Chris didn’t say Cray got his gun ready, there’s no reason to think that he wouldn’t have done so in this situation.*

**Chris:** *I shoot it in the face!*

**Alan:** *The vampire’s trying to grab you by both shoulders, and opening its mouth ready to sink fangs in your neck. But you can shoot it in the face as it comes for you. Mark, you don’t have a clear shot here. Jerry jumps and screams when the shots are fired. Roll me* ***kick ass**.*

*Alan used the monster move* **attack with great force and fury**.

*Chris rolls the dice and adds Cray’s Tough***.**

**Chris:** *Right, that’s a... five. Crap.*

**Alan:** *Did you remember +1 for reading the situation just then? You’re acting on what you saw.*

**Chris:** *Yeah, five is with the bonus.*

**Alan:** *Yeah, so you shoot it in the face a couple of times and it doesn’t even slow down. It grabs your shoulders and comes in to bite.*

*Because Cray’s* **kick some ass** *move failed, Alan is responding with* **inflict harm, as established***.*

**Mary:** *Can Mark get a shot now? Before it bites him?*

**Alan:** *Um... I guess, it’s close but Cray’s still in the way. You could maybe club it.*

**Mary:** *Can I knock its face away?*

**Alan:** *With the rifle butt? Yes, that might work. Roll... This seems like it will interrupt the attack, so roll* ***protect someone**.*

**Mary:** *Sweet, I use* ***Never again*** *to make it like I rolled a 10. As usual, all impending danger on me.*

*The vampire’s bite was interrupted by Mark’s* **protect someone** *move, so Cray doesn’t suffer harm.*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“Bring it!”*

**Alan:** *Okay, so you smash its face, and it spins Cray out the way and comes for you. It smashes you up against the wall on the far side of the hallway, and you notice you go a ways into the plaster. Now what?*

*This is the Keeper move* **inflict harm, as established** *and the effects of the successful* **protect someone** *move.*

*Mary notes down that Mark took 2-harm.*

**Mary** (screaming as Mark): *“ARRRRGH!”*

**Alan:** *Okay, you drop your rifle too.*

*Alan uses the harm move* **drop something***.*

**Mary:** *Sure, I drop the rifle as I fly back and scramble for my sawn-off. BLAM! Both barrels, sucker!*

**Alan:** *Okay, roll* ***kick some ass**. It’s trying to get with the biting on you, but it’s going for inside your elbow rather than your neck, grabbing for your arm as you shoot.*

*Mary rolls and adds Mark’s Tough.*

**Mary:** *Ha ha! Eleven! I shoot it in the gut, so it goes flying back! Four harm!*

*Alan notes down 3-harm from shotgun blast for the vampire: it has 1-armour. Again, this is* **inflict harm, as established***.*

**Alan:** *Yep, the vampire is blasted back, catches itself on a covered table, then gets back up. It caught your arm with its talons before you fired, so you take two harm as well, and there’s blood everywhere*

**Mary:** *I’m reloading!*

**Alan:** *Your hands are covered in your own blood, so it’s going to take a few moments to finish that. Cray? What are you doing?*

*Alan used the harm move* **momentarily inhibited** *to reflect Mark’s injury.*

**Chris:** *I’m going back into the hallway to check Jerry isn’t doing anything stupid.*

**Alan:** *Okay. He’s not—just standing there, mouth open, watching what you’re all doing. The vamp grabs the dust sheet and swirls it up in the way. When it comes down you can’t see where it’s gone, although the only options are out the front door or into the other room. Unless it can turn invisible or something.*

*Alan used the bystander move* **display inability or incompetence** *for Jerry, and the monster move* **escape no matter how well contained it is** *for Lucius.*

**Chris:** *Okay, I want to make sure it can’t escape. I’m casting a spell to keep it in here.*

**Alan:** *Sure, you can* ***use magic*** *to bar a place or portal to a monster. I think keeping it from leaving counts. How do you cast this spell? I think you’re going to need at least some weird ingredients.*

**Chris:** *It’s undead, so I’ll use some goofer dust. I sprinkle it on the door and write mystic symbols in it with my finger.*

**Alan:** *Okay, roll it. Mark, what are you doing while this hoodoo’s happening?*

**Mary:** *Just keeping an eye on things. I get the mallet and stakes we brought out of my pack, too.*

**Alan:** *Keeping an eye where exactly?*

**Mary:** *On the lounge room or whatever, and on Cray.*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark) “Hurry that creepy shit up! There’s a disappearing vampire in here!”

**Alan:** *Okay. Jerry screams. You both look back and the vampire has him, neck chomped and blood all over the place.*

*Alan used the monster move* **attack with stealth and calculation**.

*Alan notes down that Jerry took 5-harm from a vampire bite.*

**Alan:** *Jerry’s gone all limp in the vampire’s grasp.*

*Alan used the harm move* **pass out***.*

**Mary** (as Mark): *“Dammit!” Can I get there in time to save him?*

**Alan:** *Ah... maybe, if you* ***act under pressure**?*

**Mary:** *Is there like a light hanging above him I can shoot down?*

**Alan:** *Sure! So, you want it to fall on the vampire? Protecting Jerry?*

**Mary:** *Yes! And I’ll use* ***never again*** *for a ten. I guess all its attention is focused on me now?*

**Alan:** *Yeah, when the light fitting comes down, it smashes on top of it, and the vampire drops Jerry and just looks at you, then starts walking towards you like a gunfighter heading for a showdown.*

*This is the result of the* **protect someone** *move.*

**Alan** (speaking as Lucius): *“Very well! I will take you first.”*

**Mary** (speaking as Mark): *“Cray! Forget your stupid spell! Grab the vamp so I can stake it!”*

**Chris** (speaking as Cray): *“What? Grab it? No way!”*

**Chris:** *I’ll cast a spell to make the cable from the light shade snake down and tie it up!*

**Alan:** *That’s the ‘trap a monster’ effect. How do you cast the spell?*

**Chris:** *I just look hard at it and focus my mind, and then pull it down like I’m using the Force.*

**Alan:** *Cool.*

*Chris rolls and adds Cray’s Weird.*

**Chris:** *Yeah, it’s a nine. Glitch is short duration “Make it fast, Mark!”*

**Alan:** *Okay, so the vampire’s all tangled but the cable’s already starting to come loose.*

**Alan** (speaking as Lucius): *“What? What’s happening? Gah, stupid plastic rope!”*

**Mary:** *I stake it!*

**Alan:** *Sure, roll* ***kick ass**—it might be able to scratch you a bit even tangled up.*

*Mary rolls the dice and adds Mark’s Tough.*

**Mary:** *Nine! I guess it gets me then. I do 3-harm with the stake.*

*Alan notes down harm to Lucius, and that Lucius has been hit with a weakness: a wooden stake to the heart.*

**Alan:** *Mark, take one harm. You hammer the stake in but it doesn’t look like it went in far enough to get the heart yet. It gets one nasty scratch across your face that momentarily blinds you: take -1 forward.*

*Alan has given Mark -1 forward as a harm move. Mary notes down the harm to Mark.*

**Mary:** *I stake it again!*

*Mary rolls the dice and adds Mark’s Tough.*

**Mary:** *Thirteen, even with that -1! I inflict terrible harm!*

*Alan notes down that harm, sees that this puts Lucius at 12-harm total: he has harm capacity of 10, so this is enough to kill him (and permanently, as a weakness has been used). Alan chooses to not to inflict harm on Mark again, reasoning that between being trapped and staked through the heart, the vampire is no longer actively fighting back.*

**Alan:** *Okay, that sure got the heart. There’s a burst of dust as the vampire’s flesh disintegrates, leaving just the bones and shriveled heart, complete with stake.*

*The details of what happens when a vampire gets staked are part of the game’s mythology.*
