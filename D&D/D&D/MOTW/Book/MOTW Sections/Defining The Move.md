Custom moves for threats start with a basic idea. What does the threat need to be capable of? If the threat’s abilities are not covered by the existing Keeper and threat moves, then you need to define a custom move.

Custom moves for the hunters could be available as an improvement, or something they can all do when certain conditions are met. It can also codify something that a hunter does already, if you want a consistent rule for how it works.
