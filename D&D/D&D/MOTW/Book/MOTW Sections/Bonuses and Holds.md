Sometimes a move will give you a bonus to future dice rolls: you get to take the bonus “forward” or “ongoing.” Sometimes a move will give you a “hold.”

**FORWARD**

If you get +1 forward, you get +1 on your very next roll only.

*For example:*

*Another hunter can give you a bonus of +1 forward as the result of a move. The next thing that happens is that you charge in to attack a monster. You get +1 on your **kick some ass** roll. If you had decided to **use magic** instead, to cast a protection spell, then you would have gained the +1 on that roll. Once you have used the bonus, it’s gone.*

**ONGOING**

If you get +1 ongoing, you get +1 to every roll you make until the situation no longer applies.

*For example:*

*If you **read a bad situation**, you might be awarded +1 ongoing while using an escape route you spotted. You get +1 on all rolls while escaping via that route, but nothing more once you have escaped. You also get no bonus if you don’t try to escape via the way you spotted.*

**HOLD**

When you get a hold, you’ll get a number of points. Each point can be spent one-for-one to get a specific effect. The move will list the effects you can spend your hold on.

*For example, you are interviewing the witnesses to a monster attack and you make an* ***investigate a mystery*** *roll. Your result gives you 3 hold. You can spend your hold to ask the Keeper questions from the list in the* ***investigate a mystery*** *move.*

*You ask a witness, “Did you see where the attacker went?” and spend one hold. (“Where did it go?” is one of the questions.)*

*The Keeper says (as Mrs Henderson, the witness), “It scurried over there, and pulled up that grating and went into the sewers.”*

*As the conversation with the witnesses continues, you spend the next hold to ask the Keeper about the monster’s powers. “Hey, from all the things they’ve told me, can I work out any powers?” (“What can it do?” is another question.)*

*The Keeper replies, “The witness descriptions don’t agree at all. It must be able to change shape or maybe change memories.”*

*Later the last hold goes to ask the Keeper about whether a witness is hiding something. That exhausts your hold, so you don’t get any more questions for now.*
