This is for games with a critical organisation that the hunters have to trust. Unfortunately it has been infiltrated by evil, or perhaps always has been evil. A Professional’s Agency or Initiate’s Sect might qualify, or it could be an organisation that the hunters come across, or ally with, in play.

*Starting point*: The hunters come across something that shows that they are being lied to, or that people they trust are up to something sinister.

*Threats*:

- Minions (the traitors).
- Bystanders (the people who bought the cover story).
- Monsters behind the scenes.
- Locations for organisation sites.

*Countdown*:
