Every hunter has a certain amount of Luck they can call on in emergencies.

When you mark off a point of Luck, you can choose one of the following lucky breaks:

- Decrease a wound you just suffered to 0-harm.
- After you roll, retroactively change the result to a 12.

Your playbook has a Luck counter that keeps track of how much is left. You only get a limited supply. Make it count.
