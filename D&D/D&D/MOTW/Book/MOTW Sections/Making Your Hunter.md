After you’ve all picked your hunter types, you’ll spend about 20-30 minutes of the first session defining their abilities and establishing the relationships in your team. Follow the instructions in your playbook to create your hunter. You don’t need to spend too long deciding on each option in the playbook—if you make any choices you regret, you can always revise them after the first session.

When you get to the ‘Introductions’ section, wait until everyone catches up. The Keeper will guide everyone as you make up your hunters, so ask them if you have any questions (For the Keeper, there are instructions on how to guide this process in ‘The First Session’ section on [[0000532383]]).
