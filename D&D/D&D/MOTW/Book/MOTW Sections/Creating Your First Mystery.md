Before each game, you’ll create a mystery for the hunters to investigate. Here’s how to build your first mystery.

If you want to skip this step, you can use either of the introductory mysteries: “Dream Away the Time” on [[0000500178]], or “Damn Dirty Apes” on [[0000863159]]. Then you can resume reading at “The First Session” on [[0000532303]] for advice on how to run the game.

A mystery is made up of six basic elements. You can create them in any order, but I’ll show you the order I usually use:

- A basic concept for the mystery.
- The hook that got the hunters’ attention.
- The monster.
- The minions, bystanders, and locations that are involved.
- The mystery countdown.
- Optionally: custom moves for special aspects of the mystery.

Before I get into the guts of it, here’s what a finished mystery looks like. Read it, and then I’ll talk about how the pieces fit together.

An Example Mystery Mongolian Death Worm Attack

*The hunters get a report of some strange deaths at a local museum. Professor Josh Singer, Dr Jennifer Sofia, and Michelle Fitzsimmons were last seen alive working late unpacking and cleaning up new items for the collection. The next morning they were found “burned and partially dissolved” (according to police reports).*

*The monsters are three newly hatched Mongolian death worms. They’re bright red and look moist and intestinal. Each is about 5cm thick and 50cm long. They have a deadly venom that they can spit, and excrete via the skin. Plus, they can shoot lightning bolts. They like things dry, and water is poisonous to them.*

*There’s someone here working for the monster, sort of. Dr Kelly Morrison became obsessed with them during field work in the Gobi Desert, and she smuggled the eggs back. Her plan didn’t include them hatching and getting out, but now that they have she wants to protect and observe them.*

*While the hunters are investigating, they are likely to come across these people:*

- *Dr Frances Ferrara, who worked with the victims. She’ll be helpful to the hunters, which may endanger her.*
- *Detective Patrick Eagan. He’s the police officer in charge of investigating the deaths, and won’t appreciate the hunters getting involved.*
- *Chris Larsen, museum administrator. A stickler for procedure, he will annoy the hunters with demands for authorisation and interfere with anything he thinks is strange or against the rules.*

*The Natural History Museum is a large, modern complex. It’s divided into several wings, each with plenty of exhibition halls, offices, store rooms, and work rooms. Looking for things here, the hunters are going to be poking into all kinds of dark corners.*

*The worms have split up and are looking for warm, dry spaces to nest. Once they find those (and finish digesting their initial meal) they’ll start hunting through the museum: they won’t need to start small, either, due to their venom. Humans will be on the menu right away. Once they’ve eaten and grown, they’ll mate (each is hermaphroditic) and each lay a clutch of eggs. When those hatch, a plague of dozens of worms will spread out from the museum.*
