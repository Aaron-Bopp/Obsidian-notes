*They took my loved ones. Back then I wasn’t strong enough to fight, but I studied, trained, and now I’m ready to cleanse the world of their taint. I’ll kill them all. That’s all I have left.*

To make your Wronged, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions below to decide your look, ratings, who you lost, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.

**LOOK, PICK ONE FROM EACH LIST:**

- Man, woman, concealed.
- Sad eyes, icy eyes, angry eyes, untouchable eyes, emotionless eyes, hurt eyes, harrowed eyes.
- Nondescript clothes, ragged clothes, casual clothes, hunting gear, army surplus gear, old clothes.

**RATINGS, PICK ONE LINE:**

- Charm=0, Cool+1, Sharp-1, Tough+2, Weird+1
- Charm=0, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+2, Weird=0
- Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+2, Weird-1
- Charm-1, Cool-1, Sharp=0, Tough+2, Weird+2
- Charm+1, Cool-1, Sharp=0, Tough+2, Weird+1

**WHO YOU LOST**

Who did you lose? Pick one or more of:

- Your parent(s):                                                                  
- Your sibling(s):                                                                  
- Your spouse/partner:                                                                  
- Your child(ren):                                                                  
- Your best friend(s):                                                                  

**WHAT DID IT?**

With the Keeper’s agreement, pick the monster breed.

My prey:                                                                  

Why couldn’t you save them? You were (pick one or more):

- at fault
- selfish
- injured
- weak
- slow
- scared
- in denial
- complicit

**MOVES**

*You get all the basic moves plus three Wronged moves. You get this one:*

- **I Know My Prey**: You get +1 ongoing when knowingly investigating, pursuing or fighting the breed of monster that caused your loss.

*Then pick two of these:*

- **Berserk**: No matter how much harm you take, you can always keep going until the current fight is over. During a fight, the Keeper may not use harm moves on you and you cannot die. When the fight ends, all harm takes effect as normal.
- **NEVER AGAIN**: In combat, you may choose to **protect someone** without rolling, as if you had rolled a 10+, but you may not choose to “suffer little harm.”
- **What Does Not Kill Me...**: If you have suffered harm in a fight, you gain +1 ongoing until the fight is over.
- **Fervor**: When you **manipulate someone**, roll +Tough instead of +Charm.
- **Safety First:** You have jury-rigged extra protection into your gear, giving you +1 armour (maximum 2-armour).
- **DIY Surgery**: When **you do quick and dirty first aid on someone** (including yourself), roll +Cool. On a 10+ it’s all good, it counts as normal first aid, plus stabilize the injury and heal 1 harm. On a 7-9 it counts as normal first aid, plus one of these, your choice: 
  - Stabilise the injury but the patient takes -1 forward.
  - Heal 1-harm and stabilise for now, but it will return as 2-harm and become unstable again later.
  - Heal 1-harm and stabilise but the patient takes -1 ongoing until it’s fixed properly.
- **Tools Matter**: With your signature weapon (see your gear, below), you get +1 to **kick some ass**.

**GEAR**

Pick one signature weapon and two practical weapons.

You have protective wear, suited to your look, worth 1-armour.

If you want, you may take a classic car, classic motorcycle, plain pickup, or plain van.

Signature Weapons, pick one:

- Sawn-off shotgun (3-harm hand/close messy loud reload)
- Hand cannon (3-harm close loud)
- Fighting knife (2-harm hand quiet)
- Huge sword or huge axe (3-harm hand messy heavy)
- Specialist weapons for destroying your foes (e.g. wooden stakes and mallet for vampires, silver dagger for werewolves, etc.). 4-harm against the specific creatures it targets, 1-harm otherwise, and other tags by agreement with the Keeper.
- Enchanted dagger (2-harm hand magic)
- Chainsaw (3-harm hand messy unreliable loud heavy)

Practical weapons, pick two:

- .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud)
- 9mm (2-harm close loud)
- Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud)
- Shotgun (3-harm close messy loud)
- Big knife (1-harm hand)
- Brass knuckles (1-harm hand stealthy)
- Assault rifle (3-harm close area loud reload)

**INTRODUCTIONS**

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.

Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Wronged by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

**HISTORY**

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- They helped you at a critical point in your quest for revenge. Tell them what you needed help with.
- They stood between you and what you needed to find out. Ask them why.
- They also lost a friend or relative to these monsters. Ask them who it was.
- Relations, close or distant. Tell them exactly what.
- You saved their life, back when they were a pathetic newbie hunter. Ask them what you saved them from.
- You respect their hard-earned knowledge, and often come to them for advice.
- They showed you the ropes when you were learning how to fight.
- They saw you absolutely lose it and go berserk. Tell them what the situation was, and ask them how much collateral damage you caused.

**LUCK**

You can mark off a Luck box to *either* change a roll you just made to a 12, as if you had rolled that; *or* change a wound you have just taken to count as 0-harm, no matter how bad it was. If your Luck boxes all get filled, you’ve run out of good luck.

Okay bbbbbbb Doomed

**HARM**

When you suffer harm, mark off the number of boxes equal to harm suffered. When you reach four harm, tick “Unstable.”

Okay bbb|bbbb Dying

Unstable: b *(Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)*

**LEVELING UP**

*Experience*: bbbbb

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 Tough, max +3
- Get +1 Cool, max +2
- Get +1 Sharp, max +2
- Get +1 Weird, max +2
- Take another Wronged move
- Take another Wronged move
- Gain a haven, like the Expert has, with two options
- Add one more option to your haven
- Take a move from another playbook
- Take a move from another playbook

After you have leveled up *five* times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re below.

**ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS**

- Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- Change this hunter to a new type.
- Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- Mark two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced.
- Retire this hunter to safety.
- You track down the specific monster(s) responsible for your loss. The Keeper must make the next mystery about them.
- Change the target of your vengeful rage. Pick a new monster breed: **I know my prey** now applies to them instead.
