There’s a chosen one, and their support group. Hopefully, together you’ll be able to save the world.

The team has a Chosen, who is at the centre of things. An Expert, Initiate, or Spell-slinger would make a good mentor. A Mundane or Flake could be a friend of the Chosen. A Divine, Monstrous, or Spooky gives the team some magical powers to draw on.
