If you have advanced a basic move, you gain access to an even better result when you roll a 12 or more for the move.

For **act under pressure**, on a 12+ you rise above the pressure completely. You may choose to either do what you wanted and something extra, or to do what you wanted to absolute perfection (so that people will talk about it for years to come).

For **help out**, on a 12+ you make the difference. The person you are helping acts as if they just rolled a 12 on their move, regardless of what they actually got.

For **kick some ass**, on a 12+ you devastate and overawe your enemy. You inflict and suffer harm as normal, and pick one of these enhanced effects:

- You completely hold the advantage. All hunters involved in the fight get +1 forward.
- You suffer no harm at all.
- Your attack inflicts double the normal harm.
- Your attack drives the enemy away in a rout.

For **protect someone**, on a 12+ you defend them perfectly. Both you and the character you are protecting are unharmed and out of danger. If you were protecting a bystander, they also become your **ally** (pick a type for them as if you had taken the “gain an ally” improvement on leveling up, see [[The Basic Moves]]).

For **manipulate someone**, on a 12+ you absolutely convince them. They do what you want *right now*. For a hunter, they must **act under pressure** to resist your request. If they do what you ask, they mark one experience and take +1 ongoing while doing what you asked. For a bystander, not only do they do what you want right now, they also become your **ally** (pick a type for them as if you had taken the “gain an ally” improvement on leveling up, see [[The Basic Moves]]) for the rest of the mystery (or, if you do enough for them, permanently). Note that allies can be lost, too! If they discover you’ve manipulated them into acting against their best interests, your new **ally** may become a threat to you.

For **investigate a mystery**, on a 12+ you may ask the Keeper any question you want about the mystery, not just the listed ones.

For **read a bad situation**, on a 12+ you may ask the Keeper any question you want about the situation, not just the listed ones.

For **use magic**, on a 12+ you are infused with magical power. What you wanted to do happens and the Keeper will offer you some extra benefit on top of that.

Playbook-Specific Advanced Improvements

These are only available to the hunters of the type listed. They become available after you have leveled up five times, the same as the usual advanced improvements.

**FOR THE CHOSEN**

- Delete one doom tag from your fate, and (optionally) change one heroic tag as well.

**FOR THE DIVINE**

- Change your mission. When you choose this, you accept that your initial mission has failed, that it is impossible, or that things have changed too much to continue. Whatever the reason, decide with the Keeper what your new mission is. If none of the original choices are right for you, make up something new.

**FO[[The Initiate]]**

- Become the leader, or effective leader, of the whole Sect. 

This operates similarly to becoming the leader of your chapter. You are now in charge of everything. You don’t have superiors any more (except maybe divine ones), but you’ll still have to manage the factions within the Sect to get things done.

**FOR [[THE MONSTROUS]]**

- You have freed yourself from the curse of your kind: your curse no longer applies, but you lose 1 Weird.
- You turn evil (again): retire this character, they become one of the Keeper’s threats. 

Turning evil takes your hunter out of your control permanently. The character is now a threat, for the Keeper to use against the hunters. Given how many of the team’s secrets your hunter knows, this option shouldn’t be chosen lightly!

**FOR THE PROFESSIONAL**

- You can get some or all of the hunters hired by your agency (they’ll get the **deal with the agency** move, as well as salary and benefits). 

All the hunters you pick are now Agency employees. They all get the deal with the Agency move, and everything else that goes along with being an agent.

**FOR THE SPELL-SLINGER**

- You may cross off another option from your Tools and Techniques. This works just like when you first created your Spell-slinger—you are now less restricted in your spell casting.

**FOR THE SPOOKY**

- You discover how to use your powers at a lower price. Delete one dark side tag permanently.

**FOR THE WRONGED**

- You track down the specific monster(s) responsible for your loss—the Keeper must make the next mystery about them. 

Note that this doesn’t mean you get to automatically win. You just get a shot at them. Keeper, the Wronged’s targets should be central to the next mystery but otherwise create the mystery as normal.

- Change the target of your vengeful rage. **I know my prey** now applies to these monsters instead.

Summary: Hunter's Session

There’s two parts to this: the things you’ll do just at the start of a new game, and then the things you’ll do every time.

[[The First Time Only]]
