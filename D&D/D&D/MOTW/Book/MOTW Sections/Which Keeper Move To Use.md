Mostly it will be obvious what should happen next, and picking your move is easy. Other times it’s not so obvious, and you might need to think a little about what you will do. That’s fine, take a moment if you need to. Or you can just ask the hunters what they do—that’s a good default move when you can’t think of anything right now.

If you can’t decide, you can always fall back on your Keeper principles or your agenda, and describe something consistent with them.

Soft Moves And Hard Moves

You can use each Keeper move in one of two ways: as a “soft” move or as a “hard” move.

A **soft move** is one that threatens danger, or pushes the hunters in a certain direction, but there’s a way to a stop the danger, or divert it.

*For example: “The ice weasel races down the hall, teeth bared to rend!”*

This is a **reveal future badness** move, and gives the hunters something to react to—they can do something to prevent the danger, or ignore it and do something else instead.

A **hard move** doesn’t give the hunters a chance to react.

*For example: “The ice weasel shoulders your arm out the way, and its teeth bite deep into your shoulder, ripping through clothes, skin, and muscle. Take four harm.”*

This time it’s **inflict harm as established**, but because it’s used as a hard move, the hunter doesn’t have any chance to respond (or avoid suffering the harm).

Soft Moves Set Up Hard Moves

Use soft moves to set up situations that will lead to a hard move. A soft move gives the hunters something to deal with. If they solve that problem, great. If not, then a follow-up hard move is the consequence of failure.

When To Make A Hard Move Without Setting It Up

As well as a failed attempt to deal with a soft move, events in play can turn out so that a hard move is appropriate. Specifically:

- When the hunters hand you a golden opportunity
- When a hunter misses a roll (that is, rolls a 6 or less)
- When a hunter has used up all their Luck.

*Handing you a golden opportunity* is a situation where, for example, the hunter says, “I leap down into the horde of zombies!” If you inflict 4-harm on them from zombie bites and clawing, that’s too bad: they knew what they were getting into.

*Missing a roll* (with a total of six or less) is *always* a time when you can make a hard move. The hunter’s screwed something up badly, so do whatever you need to. For example, if a hunter tries to **protect someone** and blows it, then you can inflict harm on the victim, maybe even kill them: make whatever was threatened come to pass.

The last one’s a different case. When *someone has used all their Luck*, they become ‘doomed’. This means you are allowed to make hard moves against them any time. For example, let’s say a hunter says “I’ll go check out the camp site” and you know the yeti have set up an ambush there. Normally it would make sense to give them a chance to spot this, for instance by asking if they want to **read a bad situation** as they approach. But if the hunter is doomed (and doesn’t make a point of checking for danger), then you can choose to make a hard move, which means they only find out when two yeti grab them.

These situations are times when you are *justified* making as hard a move as you like. You don’t *have* to, but you can. Always refer back to your agenda and principles when you make these choices.
