## Five Ways A Patron Improves Your Campaign

*By Mark Tygart*

*Jenkins looked down at the fried remains of what the team called a “rat-goblin,” with a combination of pride and anxiety. He had never expected the Nazi DNA virus Dr. Piper stole from the RED FACTION’s vaults to have this impact—but he was reassured by the effectiveness of the new weapon prototypes even down here in Hamelin’s medieval sewers. What nasty “favor” was the R&D department going to ask of his team in exchange for their use? Then the [[Weird]] music began growing louder. “Time to pay the piper,” Jenkins whispered to Laura. She smiled, showing her fangs, as the rest of the team checked their [[gear]] was ready. If one of NATO’s covert COPPER GREEN containment teams showed up, Jenkins could only imagine the special hell mission the BLUE FACTION Director would send the team to as a punishment for “being indiscreet” ...*

# Initial Briefing

Monster hunting fantasy adventures are generally full of covert and notso-covert Patrons and their organizations for hunters to join, subvert, or destroy. Where would Carl Kolchak be without his tabloid newspaper to investigate for? Or Mulder and Scully without the FBI?

This is not the default case in *Monster of the Week* simply because its primary initial inspirations were the television shows *Supernatural*, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, and *Angel*.

*Supernatural* is unusual. In the early seasons, Dean and Sam Winchester often have little or no support, often have to sustain themselves financially, and were routinely forced to impersonate law enforcement officers to gain resources while hunting [[monsters]]. This was usually played for laughs, and the brothers generally used celebrity names or pop culture names for their fake identities.

Buffy’s [[Mentor]] Giles reported to the “Watchers’ Council” but they were usually so remote and ineffective as to be mere window dressing.

Angel formed a detective agency to pay the bills, which is a sort of Patron.

Consider how much easier it is to initiate a James Bond adventure. Agent 007 has no trouble finding friends, enemies, overly elaborate plots filled with lasers, and bizarre attempts at world domination given his employment by the British Secret Service.

In terms of *Monster of the Week*, Initiates and Professionals always have some sort of Patron but any campaign can benefit from their presence. [[The hunters]] could be employed by anything from a conspiracy-investigating blog, a UFO abductees support group, or a secret zoo stocking [[monsters]] for a zany billionaire. Of course the players may soon discover that zany billionaire is a psychopath, the UFO support is secretly run by evil Lizard Aliens, and the blog has developed a virus planted by Chinese Intelligence.

A Patron can always provide two important assets: direction and resources.

# Patrons Provide Direction

Without a Patron supplying direction, a Keeper needs a new hook for every mystery [[the hunters]] investigate. After a while, inventing needy friends and relatives for [[the hunters]] to [[Help Out]] becomes tired.

It is much easier to have [[the hunters]] assigned a case by their supervisor, or a story by their editor, than to have the monster once again lurch into [[the hunters]]’ favorite diner and interrupt dinner! Patron organizations do not have to be extremely well-organized and resourced for this role. A simple group of retired law enforcement officers who know the supernatural is real would be plenty to provide leads and missions.

Of course the Patron or her organization are going to make all sorts of demands on our hunters, however unexpected. Real life is a wonderful [[inspiration]] for this device. How [[many]] of us have been forced into uneasy

‘social’ situations due the necessity of attending ‘optional’ events. Maybe the psychopath billionaire monster-zoo owner decides he is [[the hunters]]’ new best friend and decides to join them on a “routine” mission. Or the editor of the blog wants a puff piece about recent crocodile sightings in the local sewerage system. Worst of all, [[the hunters]] could be required to attend a rubber chicken dinner honoring them as slayers of the year hosted by the local chamber of commerce. Horrifying!

# Patrons Provide Resources

The more resources a Patron grants, the more it should require of its agents in return. Being a member of an international covert conspiracy should be more demanding than working for the reality television talk show *Conversing about Cryptids*. Monster hunting Agencies could also be bloated bureaucratic nightmares (see Charles Stross’ thrilling, comedic Laundry novels for ideas here, e.g. “You killed a vampire? Form 56-X in triplicate with special undead termination clause filled out before sunset.”)

The key is usually not to deny your hunters the specific resource they covet, but simply to make sure it comes with a demanding price. It is often fun to make this somewhat mysterious or bizarre. Indeed the mysterious nature of [[the hunters]]’ Patron can become an enjoyable key element to the campaign. Why exactly is the Patron intent on controlling the world’s supply of lime green jello? Or has a bizarre collection of hairless cats that require ‘special treats?’ Or is so eager to acquire ‘fresh’ DNA from the actor William Shatner?

# The Patrons Can Develop the Mystery

A fun aspect of your mythology can come from developing the backstory and secrets of a patron organization.

A demanding boss may be [[the hunters]]’ best friend when the chips are down, like Deputy Director Skinner on *The X-Files*. An annoying, innocent intern could turn out to be a serial killer as happened on *Grimm*. The head of Research & Development may be uncovering dangerous truths about the universe—just like an H.P. Lovecraft character. In the best tradition of Indiana Jones, the papers [[the hunters]] just stumbled across in the archives indicate the agency was really formed by crusaders in the 12th century to find a lost artifact and they [[haven]]’t found it yet.

Sometimes you have to lie to your boss. On the television show

*Grimm*, homicide investigator and monster hunter Nick Burkhardt can never predict whether his superior Captain Renard will be a friend or foe from one week to the next, and your hunters can be kept in similar suspense. In early *iZombie* episodes, undead coroner Liv Moore must unmask supernatural villains by using the insight she gains from consuming the brains of murder victims while telling her Patron she is “psychic.” Your hunters may have to adopt a similar cover for their supernatural abilities.

# A Patron Can Be The Mystery

[[The hunters]] may discover the agency they work for has an evil faction of conspirators and must be fixed or destroyed. The classic example of this is the early *X-Files* and the classic evil cabal preparing for a planetary invasion aided by shape-shifting alien bounty hunters. *Fringe* and *Counterpart* have doppelgangers nefariously subverting our universe from a parallel dimension: nobody is safe from being “replaced.”

![[image48.jpg]]Another possibility is the Patron is so scary and ruthless that [[the hunters]] have to manipulate it or them to prevent crimes against humanity, despite the essential good work the Patron provides. The *Twenty Palaces* book series by Harry Connolly is a wonderful example of this, as the antihero Ray Lilly must deal with supernatural problems while keeping innocent bloodshed to a minimum, or be faced with his employers’ more efficient methods, which may include eliminating a low-level operative like Lilly.

A third and [[Devastating]] possibility is that the patron’s ultimate agenda is evil. On the fourth season of *Fringe* the viewers discovered a universe where William Bell was actually the source of the evil Pattern experiments.

# The Patron Can Be Destroyed

An even more [[Devastating]] way to either open or climax a campaign is for [[the hunters]] to return back from a mission to find their patron has been destroyed by a mysterious entity or group. [[The hunters]] must hustle to retrieve what is left of the destroyed Agency’s equipment and intelligence from their few remaining boltholes and safehouses all while being hunted by mysterious supernatural assassins. This could be [[Devastating]] to a Professional or Initiate hunter, so [[the Keeper]] should carefully consider this option and have a long build-up to destruction. Of course it may only appear that the group is destroyed...

![[image50.png]]A well executed example of this idea is the classic 1970s Sydney Pollack thriller *Three Days of the Condor* wherein Joseph Turner returns late from lunch only to find all the other members of his clandestine library have been murdered by unknown gunmen. He must unravel the deadly mystery to survive. By my count, the *Mission Impossible* film series has used this plot at least twice.

A good way to end such a campaign is to have the players reform their old Agency with [[the hunters]] as the new management team.

# Concluding Notes

An employing agency lets you add elements from police procedurals and espionage thrillers to your *Monster of the Week* campaign. It’s a [[useful]] choice that allows for exciting plot developments as your campaign goes on.

Now excuse me: my shoe phone is calling—I have another case to solve.
