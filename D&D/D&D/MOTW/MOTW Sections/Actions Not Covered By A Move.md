Sometimes [[the hunters]] will come up with something they want to try that isn’t covered by existing [[moves]]. Depending on exactly what it is, there are several ways to deal with this.

If the action is something a normal person could do, then you can just accept it. Look at your list of Keeper [[moves]] and see if any of them apply to the action: if they do, then use that move. Quite often, I find that [[the Keeper]] move that applies is “Ask them what they do next.” Let them do what they want and see what comes of it.

If it’s something that [[moves]] the mystery along, and you can’t think of how rolling dice for it will be more interesting than just accepting it, that’s another case where it’s best for them to just do it.

**In fact, [[Act Under Pressure]] and [[Use Magic]] are intended to be catch-alls. If you can’t work out which move to use, one of these two will usually work.**
- If it’s something that a normal person could do, but it’s really hard and/or dangerous, ask them to **[[Act Under Pressure]]**.
- If it’s something that a normal person couldn’t do at all, then you can ask them to **[[Use Magic]]**, or **[[big magic]]**.

Another alternative is to quickly make up a custom move for this particular situation. Only do this if you think it will come up again, and only once you are comfortable enough with the [[moves]] that you can do this quickly. See [[Custom Moves]]
