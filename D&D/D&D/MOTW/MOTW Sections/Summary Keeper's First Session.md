- Start the mystery with a teaser scene.
- Let them begin investigating. Ask lots of questions to work out how each hunter does things, and to find out about their pasts.

- When any character suffers [[harm]], use a [[harm]] move on them.
- Make a note of everything you can.

- Go through the [[end-of-session experience questions]] and have [[the hunters]] mark experience based on the answers.
- Discuss how it went. Let them change their hunters around a bit if required.
