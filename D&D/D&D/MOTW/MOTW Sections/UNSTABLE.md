**UNSTABLE WOUNDS**

Once a hunter has suffered 4-[[harm]], their injuries become unstable. That means that it will get worse, until it’s properly treated.

While the injuries are unstable, you may tell the hunter they take another point of [[harm]] at any time. Use the same process as deciding which [[harm]] move to use: given the type and severity of the injuries, would it be likely to have gotten worse yet?

If an unstable wound has been left for a day and you [[haven]]’t added any more [[harm]] yet, do it then.
