Here are some simple skeletons for [[arcs]] that allow you to slot in some threats and build up the rest of the arc quickly.

Use them as-is, or as [[inspiration]] for your own [[arcs]].

I’ve included a starting point in each. These are events that might happen in your game that provide a perfect opportunity to put that arc into play.

# Ancient Evil Rising

This centers on a dormant, dead, or imprisoned monster and the allies or servants working to bring it back.

*Starting point*: [[the hunters]] stumble upon early preparations for the awakening.

*Threats:*

- The monster that’s awakening.
- [[Minions]] and allied [[monsters]].
- The location where the monster is waiting.

*Countdown*:

# The Nemesis  
This works for any hunter(s) with a nemesis—possibly a monster that escaped, or the one [[The Wronged]] is hunting down, or something from  a destiny or [[Dark Past]]. The nemesis might be after an individual hunter,  or the whole team.  Note that my werewolf example arc, above, is a version of this  template (although with a few changes, to reflect the details of that  
particular game).  Starting point: A monster gets away, or there is a Wronged in the team.  

*Threats*:  
- A monster (the nemesis).  
- [[Minions]] and allied [[monsters]].  
- [[Bystanders]] (people the hunter cares about).  

*Countdown*:

# The End of Days

This is about the Apocalypse. The world is going to end.

*Starting point*: The End of the World is prophesied, or [[the hunters]] are told of what is being planned by a monster or conspirator, or there is a Chosen in the team.

*Threats:*

- Several [[monsters]], including at least one destroyer.
- Hordes of [[minions]].
- A location (the place it begins).

*Countdown*:

# Corruption

This is for games with a critical organisation that [[the hunters]] have to trust. Unfortunately it has been infiltrated by evil, or perhaps always has been evil. A Professional’s Agency or Initiate’s Sect might qualify, or it could be an organisation that [[the hunters]] come across, or ally with, in play.

*Starting point*: [[The hunters]] come across something that shows that they are being lied to, or that people they trust are up to something sinister.

*Threats*:

- [[Minions]] (the traitors).
- [[Bystanders]] (the people who bought the cover story).
- [[Monsters]] behind the scenes.
- [[Locations]] for organisation sites.

*Countdown*:
