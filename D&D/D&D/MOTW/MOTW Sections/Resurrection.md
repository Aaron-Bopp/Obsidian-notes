If someone wants to bring a slain hunter (or someone else) back from the dead, this requires **[[Big Magic]]**. But there’s an extra step for this particular case.

**When you** **return to life,** roll -[[Weird]] (so subtract three if you have +3 [[Weird]], add one for -1 [[Weird]], etc.). The weirder you are, the weirder it is when you come back from the dead.

On a 10+, you have changed a little. Mark experience and pick any one of the options below (for 7-9 or miss results).

On a 7-9, choose one of these:

- You come back a little bit broken (memory loss, stressed, disconnected).
- You come back a little different. Add 1 to one rating (max +3) and subtract 1 from another (min -2).
- You come back very different. Change to a new playbook, just as if you took that advanced improvement (see [[Help Out]]).
- Your revival satisfies an ancient prophecy.
- Something comes back with you (e.g. a possessing spirit, a slain monster is revived, an ancient evil is released), but it’s not a pressing danger.
- You, or the one who brought you back, owes a favour to a powerful spirit, monster, or demon.

On a miss, choose one of these:

- You come back broken (soulless, insane, depressive).
- You come back disabled. Take -1 to a rating (to -2, at worst).
- Your revival satisfies an ancient, dark, and terrible prophecy.
- Something comes back with you (e.g. a possessing spirit, a slain monster is revived, an ancient evil is released). It is an immediate and pressing danger.
- You, or the one who brought you back, owes a huge debt (soul, firstborn, ten years of servitude, etc.) to a powerful spirit, monster, or demon.
