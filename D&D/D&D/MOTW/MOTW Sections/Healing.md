A 0-[[harm]] wound goes away right after you get it. It can cause a momentary problem, but after that it is purely cosmetic.

Moderate wounds (1-3 [[harm]]) will improve when your hunter has a chance to rest up (e.g. a decent night’s sleep), or get some first aid treatment. This reduces an injury by 1-[[harm]].

First aid does not normally require a move, it’s just regular practice. Hunter [[moves]] that provide healing may be used in addition to first aid. You can only benefit from first aid once per injury or condition.

Serious wounds (4+ [[harm]]) require treatment. They are normally [[unstable]], meaning that they will worsen if untreated (the Keeper will tell you when to mark off another point of [[harm]]). Left too long, serious wounds will kill you. If a move tells you that the injury is now stable, you can erase the mark in the [[unstable]] box. If you take more [[harm]] and are still at 4-[[harm]] or more, then your injuries become [[unstable]] again. For serious wounds, first aid heals one [[harm]] but it will still be [[unstable]].

What counts as treatment depends on the wound, but it will usually be one of the following:

- A hunter’s healing move.
- Time in an infirmary in someone’s [[haven]].
- A visit to a doctor or emergency room.
- A [[magic]] spell.

Healing [[moves]] will mention how [[many]] [[harm]] they heal.

[[Healing Between Mysteries]]

The rules for healing (from [[the hunters]]’ perspective) are on 0000370773. In brief, they are:

- 0-[[harm]] wounds only apply at the moment they happen: no healing time is required to get over them.
- Stable wounds get better by 1 point for each day of rest, or when medical attention is given.
- 4+ [[harm]] wounds need stabilization and long term treatment. It’s your call how long that takes. As a general rule, any proper treatment (a visit to a doctor or emergency room, or time in a [[haven]] infirmary) will stabilise the injury and heal 1 [[harm]].
- 8-[[harm]] or more means the victim is dead.
- Routine first aid heals 1 point of [[harm]] for a single injury or condition and takes a few minutes. Additional first aid will only help someone if there’s a new injury or condition to treat.
- Healing [[moves]] will say how much they heal.

Additionally, at the end of a mystery all [[the hunters]] get healed to account for the time passed.

If there’s downtime before the next mystery, have everyone erase all [[harm]]: there’s time for them to have had all the treatment they need.

If the next mystery follows right on the last, everyone gets 1-[[harm]] healed. That represents that they’ve had time for some recovery, but not much.

For [[monsters]] and [[minions]], it’s up to you to decide if (and how much) they might have healed between encounters. Some creatures might have the power to heal easily and be completely fine the next time [[the hunters]] meet them; others might heal the same as a normal human does, or not at all.
