**USING [[BYSTANDERS]]**

[[Bystanders]] don’t normally intend to cause trouble for [[the hunters]], but they do so anyway. Think of each bystander as a person who wants one simple thing (which is represented by their motivation). A **victim** might want to just stay in his apartment, [[whatever]] [[the hunters]] say is coming. An **official** might just want to finish the paperwork and be done with this case, without dealing with any crazy hunters.

When thinking about bystander [[moves]], consider the bystander’s motivation, and what dumb thing they could do that will lead to trouble for [[the hunters]]. What can the bystander complicate for [[the hunters]]? How can they get in the way? This applies even when the bystander helps [[the hunters]]: this will give [[the hunters]] extra problems, starting with keeping the helper alive.

Bystander motivations are not always things that immediately lead to trouble. For example:

A **witness** is motivated to reveal information. Although when you reveal information to a hunter, that does tend to lead to trouble: telling [[the hunters]] where to find a monster usually leads to them going to fight it! Witnesses might also give [[the hunters]] too much information, or tell them something incomplete or just plain wrong.

A **helper** can easily create trouble despite wanting to help [[the hunters]], just by giving the hunter someone to look after. Or consider a helper who tries to lure the monster towards [[the hunters]].

An **innocent**, wanting to do the right thing, can cause trouble by insisting that the authorities get involved, or by telling people the whole truth at an inopportune time.

Any normal person [[the hunters]] talk to should be given a name and threat type, almost always a bystander type. If you have no particular idea what their role in the story is going to be, default to **witness** if they might have some clues for [[the hunters]], or **victim** otherwise.
