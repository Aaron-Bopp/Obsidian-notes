**USING [[MONSTERS]]**

[[Monsters]] are the key threat type, always there in the shadows, behind everything bad that is happening. They should be dangerous and scary, but also remote at first. Let the monster be revealed slowly, as [[the hunters]] close in. This will be matched by [[the hunters]] gradually learning about the monster’s powers and weaknesses.

Don’t be afraid to use the monster [[threat moves]] to get it out of trouble, either. Especially in cases where [[the hunters]] track it down early in the mystery, you can let it escape for the time being, allowing it (and [[the hunters]]) a chance to rest and regroup.

Finally, it will likely come down to a fight between [[the hunters]] and the monster. This is the chance to throw everything at them: use all its unnatural powers, gloat, and generally make the final fight as tough and exciting as possible.
