All [[the hunters]] have a set of [[moves]] that allow them to investigate and deal with [[monsters]]. Hunters also have their own [[Playbook Moves]] and can perform [[Actions Not Covered By A Move]].

**The basic [[moves]]**:
- **[[Act Under Pressure]]**, used for any difficult or dangerous action that isn’t covered by another move.
- **[[Help Out]]**, used to help another hunter do something. If you succeed, you’ll give them a bonus on their task.
- **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**, used to work out what kind of monster you are dealing with, what it can do, and what it’s planning.
- **[[Kick Some Ass]]**, used for fighting. Fighting [[monsters]], mainly.
- **[[Manipulate Someone]]**, used to try and get someone to do something for you, after you give them some kind of reason.
	- How do you ask? What do you offer, to make them do what you want? Why would they believe your offer is genuine?
- **[[Protect Someone]]**, used to save someone from danger.
- **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, used to work out what dangers are immediately threatening you. For instance, if you think you are walking into a trap, or want to do some tactical analysis.
