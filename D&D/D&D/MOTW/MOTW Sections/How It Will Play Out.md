This is an improvisational game. You will start each mystery having defined the monster and other details, but you won’t know how the situation will play out once [[the hunters]] get involved. Let them do what they want: it’s your responsibility to decide how the people and [[monsters]] and anything else react to those actions.

The game is improvised in the wider scale too: you and the other players will develop a backstory and mythology about [[the hunters]] and their world as you play. When something happens in an individual mystery, you can weave some of those events back into later events to build a consistent world.

[[No Planning Ahead]]
