[[At the end of each session]], [[the Keeper]] will ask the following questions:

- Did we conclude the current mystery?
- Did we save someone from certain death (or worse)?
- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we learn something new and important about one of [[the hunters]]?

If you get one or two “Yes” answers, each hunter marks one experience. If you get three or four, each hunter marks two.
