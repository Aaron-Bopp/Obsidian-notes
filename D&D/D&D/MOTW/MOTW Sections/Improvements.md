There are ten types of improvement. Here are the details:

**GET +1 TO A RATING (MAX +X)**

Permanently raise the specified rating. The maximum is a limit: you can only raise the rating to the listed maximum, and no further. If your rating is already at (or above) the listed maximum, then don’t select this improvement.

*For example, your hunter has [[Tough]]=0 and you select an improvement: “+1 [[Tough]] (maximum +3).” Increase your [[Tough]] rating to [[Tough]] +1.*

**TAKE ANOTHER MOVE FROM YOUR PLAYBOOK**

Select another one of the [[moves]] from your playbook.

**TAKE A MOVE FROM ANOTHER PLAYBOOK**

Select a move from any other playbook that’s available in your game (whether it’s currently in use or not).

This improvement requires a little care. It won’t always make sense to take certain [[moves]] (especially supernatural ones). Make sure that the new move makes sense for your hunter.

**GAIN AN ALLY/GAIN A TEAM**

You gain a new ally or a friendly team of people to help you out. You might already know the ally/team, or they might be new to the story.

Allies and teams are defined the same way, even though an ally is individual and a team is several people (usually 2-6). The main difference is that for a team, the motivation describes how they act *as a team*, but the individual members can have their own, different, motivation when they do their own thing.

Pick one of the following types (the “motivation” is the guideline for [[the Keeper]] about how they act):

- Ally: subordinate (motivation: to follow your exact instructions)
- Ally: lieutenant (motivation: to execute the spirit of your instructions)
- Ally: friend (motivation: to provide emotional support)
- Ally: [[bodyguard]] (motivation: to intercept danger)
- Ally: confidante (motivation: to give you advice and perspective)
- Ally: backup (motivation: to stand with you)

If the ally/team members don’t have names yet, pick them now. Decide what their background is too, how they look, and any special skills they bring.

**GAIN A [[HAVEN]] LIKE [[The Expert]] HAS**

You get a [[haven]]. When you take this, it will tell you how [[many]] options you can pick from the list in [[The Expert]] playbook.

Decide how you got the [[haven]], and where it is.

**ADD AN OPTION TO YOUR [[HAVEN]]**

Select a new [[haven]] option from the list in [[The Expert]] playbook. You have added this facility to your [[haven]].

Don’t bother taking this improvement if you don’t have a [[haven]]!

**CROOKED: RECOVER A STASH OF MONEY**

Like it says, you get a big pile of cash to spend. It’s a lot, but not unlimited.

**INITIATE: GAIN COMMAND OF YOUR CHAPTER OF THE SECT**[[The Initiate]] can take this. It means they get promoted to be head of their local chapter. This giveThe Initiate access to all the Sect’s local facilities and command of the chapter’s members.

It doesn’t mean you can constantly bring people along to help you on your mysteries—you need to take a team under your command for that.

You can still call on resources from the Sect on a case by case basis, using your usual start-of-the-mystery move, but you can ask for bigger things now. Of course, your new superiors also expect more from you.

**MUNDANE: ERASE A [[LUCK]] MARK**

Erase a used [[Luck]] mark from your sheet. You have bought some time before Fate comes for you.

**PROFESSIONAL: ADD RESOURCE TAG/CHANGE RED TAPE TAG**

If you want to add a new resource tag, pick one from the list in the Agency section of your playbook.

If you want to change a red tape tag, erase the one you don’t want and put a new one from the list in its place.

Either of these changes may imply the Agency is altering tactics or objectives, so there might be further consequences because of this.

**SPELL-SLINGER: TAKE ANOTHER COMBAT [[MAGIC]] PICK**

Pick a new combat [[magic]] option, either a new base or a new extra.

**SPOOKY: CHANGE SOME OR ALL OF YOUR DARK SIDE TAGS**

Erase the old tags and substitute new ones that you want to change to. You don’t get to have any fewer, just change them around.

This implies that you have changed your relationship with your powers in some way.

[[Advanced Improvements]]

Improvements usually include:

- One rating that may be improved to +3.
- Three ratings that may be improved to +2.
- Two choices of [[moves]] from another playbook.
- Two choices of extra [[moves]] from this playbook.
- Two special choices. These should be specific to the hunter type and reflect how they will develop and grow.
- Optionally, add an advanced improvement (or two) specific to this hunter type. Only do so if there is something that really needs to be here, like the final resolution of thematic issues unique to the playbook.

Balance?

Don’t worry about balancing your hunter type against the others. If you follow the guidelines above (more or less), the playbook will work fine with the other [[hunter types]].
