This is an improvisational game in which you create a story together.

The story emerges from a conversation between the players, with [[the Keeper]] describing the initial situation and the rest of the players describing what their hunters do in response.

This leads into an [[ongoing]] back-and-forth between [[the Keeper]] and hunters. [[The Keeper]] will ask you questions and describe how the inhabitants of the game’s world react, based on your answers.

[[The Keeper]] will also present you with situations and crises to do with the monster you’re hunting and its potential victims. These require new decisions from you about what happens next: you’ll describe what your hunter does, and make [[moves]] when they’re called for. Each of your decisions and actions will lead to new situations.

When deciding how to react, think like your hunter and keep your agenda in mind.

This is an improvisational game in which you create a story together.

The story emerges from a conversation between the players. You’ll describe an initial situation and the other players will describe how their hunters respond. This leads into an [[ongoing]] back-and-forth between you and [[the hunters]], as each decision [[the hunters]] make leads to a new situation, requiring new decisions about what happens next.

To help you make your decisions about what happens next whenever the outcome is uncertain, the rules restrict you to certain options. These parts of the conversation are called “[[moves]].” Keeper [[moves]] work differently to hunter [[moves]]: your [[moves]] are more general, to allow you to build the game’s world in accordance with your responsibilities. The [[moves]] flow from your [[Keeper agenda]], Keeper principles, and the things you should [[always say]], so I’ll explain more about those, first.
