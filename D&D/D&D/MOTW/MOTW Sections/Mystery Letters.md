Mystery letters are a technique to give [[the hunters]] information to set up a new mystery and start the game with a roar. They’re especially [[useful]] when:

- You are running a convention game.
- Someone missed a game, to bring them (and yourself) back up to speed.
- There’s been a hiatus in your game.
- There’s some unfinished business from the last game session.
- You want to give [[the hunters]] some clues about the mystery.
- You want to start with [[the hunters]] already in the midst of the action.

The letter should briefly remind the hunter what happened last time, and where you left off. Include any new information that you want to give the hunter. For example, you can put [[the hook]] for this mystery and some background information they have already discovered.

Then put in a custom move for the hunter to roll, or pick from a list of options. The [[moves]] should either provide some [[useful]] information, or put the hunter right into the action, or both.

Here’s some fragments from letters I used for a convention scenario. The team are in a haunted house, attempting to exorcise a poltergeist.

An information-finding move:

*Obviously you checked out the haunting’s background before the job. Roll me +[[Weird]], to see what you’ve found out, or worked out. On a 10+ ask me two of these, on a 7-9 ask me one. On a miss, you can ask me one anyhow but you had to do something dangerous to find out. I’ll let you know what that was. The questions you can ask:*

- *What’s the buzz on the cryptozoology and ghost hunter message boards and mailing lists?*
- *I found some writing in blood on a mirror. What did it say?*
- *What did I notice when I looked at the map?*

A move to get into the action:

*The initial check of the house went okay, but then things turned bad. Roll me +[[Sharp]] and see what happened: On a 10+ pick two, on a 7-9 pick one:*

- *You have the poltergeist in a ghost trap.*
- *You do not have a huge shard of mirror embedded in your leg (that means you do otherwise).*
- *You know where some of the other ghosts are.*

*On a miss, well. I’ll let you know what’s going wrong (everything).*

In both [[moves]] I have options that will suggest what’s going on beyond the immediate situation. In the first, the fact that the map is important is raised even if they don’t ask me about it. In the second, the “other ghosts” had not been mentioned earlier, so this is the first hint that there’s something extra going on.

There’s also that negatively phrased option about the mirror shard. The hunter has to pick it to avoid trouble, because otherwise (by implication), they’ll have that injury.

Example Mystery Letter

Here’s an entire mystery letter to use as a model. This one is for a hunter who was away because the player missed the previous session.

*Dear Carter,*

*Remember how you’d taken that sample from the lake creature for tests? You’ve got your results back from your friend in the police forensic lab. Ask me one of these questions to find out what you [[learned]]:*

- *Is it related to anything we have met before?*
- *Did we really kill it?*
- *How does it tie in with that old woman... what was her name, Janice? and what she told you?*

*You’ve been away from the team for a week now, and I’d like to know what you’ve been up to, and what you achieved. Here are some things I know you wanted to do:*

- *Check up on where the Unseeing Ones might have holed up.*
- *Research a spell that will cure Theresa.*
- *Get [[hold]] of some of those “can kill anything” bullets from that creepy dude.*

*If there’s anything you want to add to that list, go ahead and ask. I’ll let you know if it’s okay (anything you could do in a week should be fine).*

*Roll +[[Sharp]] to see how much you got done.*

- *On a 10+ you can pick two of them to be done, on a 7-9 only one.*
- *On a miss you can pick one if you want, but you got into trouble doing it. Getting you out of that trouble is where we’ll kick off today.*

*Love and kisses, your Keeper*

Here you can see: a reminder and a chance to learn a little about the bigger picture, a custom move that can tell the hunter some [[useful]] facts and add information for the story, and another move to help the hunter work towards one of their goals.
