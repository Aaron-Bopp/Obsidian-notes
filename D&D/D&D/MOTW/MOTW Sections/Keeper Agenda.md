Remember that your agenda is to:

- Make the world seem real.
- Play to see what happens.
- Make [[the hunters]]’ lives dangerous and scary.

How To Use [[the Keeper Agenda]]

*Making the world seem real* means that you describe the world in a way that makes sense. Most things are going to be the same as they are in our world. Normal people will act like normal people, for instance. As part of making the world seem real, the rules you establish for [[magic]] and [[monsters]] should be consistent (unless you decide to undermine that in order to make [[the hunters]]’ lives dangerous and scary—see below).

*Play to see what happens* means you let the story develop naturally. When you prepare a mystery, you decide what will happen if [[the hunters]] don’t get involved. When [[the hunters]] start interfering in the monster’s plans, let the results from that happen organically, based on what [[the hunters]] do and the [[moves]] you decide to make.

*Make [[the hunters]]’ lives dangerous and scary.* Well, that’s just what it says. [[The hunters]] are [[Cool]] action heroes and for that to matter they need to be dealing with horrific and overwhelming stuff. The harder it is to save the [[bystanders]] they meet, the more rewarding it will be when they manage.

The sections that follow (about your principles, the things you should [[always say]], and your [[moves]]) are all designed to support you in sticking to your agenda.
