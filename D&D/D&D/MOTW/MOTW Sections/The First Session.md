In the first session, you’ll create your hunters and investigate your first mystery.

The first step is to decide if the group wants to pick a team concept (Team Concepts). That’s the reason you are a team, for example, “We all work for a secret monster hunting agency” or “We defend our home town against the [[monsters]] that keep coming here.” [[The Keeper]] may have some suggestions based on what they’ve been planning.

If you have a team concept that needs certain [[hunter types]], allocate those first.

If you don’t have a team concept, just let everyone pick a playbook (that’s your hunter rules and record sheet) and see what the team looks like. You’ll work out why they are together as you create your hunters, establish their [[history]] with each other, and as you play the game.
