Getting everyone into a room to play is the next step.

I’m going to assume that you get all the saying, “Hi,” and getting snacks and drinks and catching up out of the way first. I’ll tell you about the game stuff you need to do.



In the first session, you’ll create your hunters and investigate your first mystery.

The first step is to decide if the group wants to pick a team concept ([[Team Concepts]]). That’s the reason you are a team, for example, “We all work for a secret monster hunting agency” or “We defend our home town against the monsters that keep coming here.” The Keeper may have some suggestions based on what they’ve been planning.

If you have a team concept that needs certain hunter types, allocate those first.

If you don’t have a team concept, just let everyone pick a playbook (that’s your hunter rules and record sheet) and see what the team looks like. You’ll work out why they are together as you create your hunters, establish their history with each other, and as you play the game.
