A key element of the use of [[moves]] is “You have to make the move.”

This means that if you want to (for instance) **manipulate someone** in the game, you need to describe your hunter doing that. How do you ask? What do you offer, to make them do what you want? Why would they believe your offer is genuine?

*For example:*

*Alan, [[the Keeper]]: “The flayed one is racing you to the car, and it looks like it’s going to get to you before you can close the door. So Mark, what do you do now?”*

*Mary, playing her hunter Mark: “I **kick some ass**!”*

*Alan: “What are you doing?”*

*Mary: “I’m going to smash it out the way with my baseball bat so I can get in the car.”*

*Alan: “That sounds like you’re not really getting into a fight: what’s most important? Killing the flayed one or getting to the car?”*

*Mary: “Oh, yeah, killing it I guess. I’ll stop running and just start smashing it on the head.”*

*Alan: “Sure. The flayed one brandishes its skinning knife as it grabs you. It screams, ‘You will become one of us now, hunter!’ Now roll **kick ass.**”*

It works the other way too—if you are describing what you are doing, someone might notice that you are making one of the [[moves]]. In that case, go ahead and roll the dice to see what happens.

*For example:*

*Alan: “Okay, you get to the place the body was found. You can still see some bloodstains on the concrete, and there’s some scratches there that might be related to the attack.”*

*Mary: “I want to carefully check the bloodstains, to work out how she was killed. Like is it a blood spray from a torn throat or did she bleed out slowly from a wound or what?”*

*Alan: “That sounds like you’re **investigating a mystery**. Why don’t you roll?”*

Sometimes [[the Keeper]] will ask you questions to clarify what’s going on. That’s cool; for the game to work, everyone needs to clearly understand what’s happening, so make sure your answer in as much detail as you can.
