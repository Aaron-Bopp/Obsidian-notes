- Did we conclude the current mystery?
- Did we save someone from certain death (or worse)?
- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we learn something new and important about one of [[the hunters]]?

If you get one or two “yes” answers, have [[the hunters]] mark one experience. If you get three or four, they mark two.

Alternatively see [[Legacy Experience Rules]]
