Most sessions, expect each hunter to level up once or twice, getting one or two [[improvements]]. At first, this does not contribute one way or another to how the story is playing out.

However, when [[the hunters]] get to the [[advanced improvements]] after five level-ups, they will be getting to peak effectiveness. A hunter who has taken most of their starting [[improvements]] and a few [[advanced improvements]] will have a wide array of [[moves]] to deal with the problems they encounter, and things usually go the way they want.

Once a hunter reaches this point, try to push [[arcs]] relating to that hunter towards closure. Depending on exactly how fast [[the hunters]] earn advances in your game, expect them to reach this point after ten to twenty sessions.

There’s also that advanced improvement “retire your hunter to safety.” If anyone picks that, or is seriously considering it, that’s a clue that that hunter’s story is approaching an end (although it might not be the end of the story for the rest of the team).
