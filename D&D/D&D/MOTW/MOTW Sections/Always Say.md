When it’s time for you to say something, what you say is one of these:

- What the principles demand.
- What the rules demand.
- What your prepared mystery and [[arcs]] demand.
- What honesty demands.

Using What You Always Say

The “Always say” rules ensure you stick to your job.

*Say something that the principles demand.* The principles keep the style of the game grounded in action-horror, and help you decide what will come next.

*Say what the rules demand.* When someone makes a move, follow the rules for that move. Don’t apply them inconsistently.

*Say what your prepared mysteries and [[arcs]] demand.* That’s what you prepared them for, after all. If the mystery countdown says the rakshasa is going after the mayor next, that’s what you say (unless other events have changed its plan, of course). [[Arcs]] are [[ongoing]] or recurring threats, like season-long stories or big bad [[monsters]] (I talk more about them on 0000741446), but are treated here the same as mysteries.

*Say what honesty demands* means you should let [[the hunters]] know anything they would be aware of. For example, there’s a monster waiting to ambush them and they’re walking right into it. But an experienced, bad-ass hunter would know to be careful here. It makes sense to say to them, “This would be a good ambush spot—maybe you want to **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**?” Or, if they’re talking about the werewolf they’re hunting and they say, “Silver kills werewolves” but that isn’t true for *your* werewolves, then let them know, “Actually silver is a myth, but wolfsbane works.” Or if they’re going to make a move like **[[Protect Someone]]** and they’ll need to throw themselves in front of a flesh-stitcher, let them know that they’re going to suffer a **lot** of [[harm]] if they do it.

More generally: You should be a fan of [[the hunters]], so don’t let dumb, unsaid stuff trip them up.

Extending that, you can always give a player a do-over if a situation wasn’t what they thought it was. For example, if someone chooses to suffer [[harm]] as a move result, thinking it will only be a minor injury but in fact it’s enough to kill them. In that case, let them go back and choose the option that keeps them alive instead.
