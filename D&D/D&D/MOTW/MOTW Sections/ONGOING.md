If you get +1 ongoing, you get +1 to every roll you make until the situation no longer applies.

*For example:*

*If you **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, you might be awarded +1 ongoing while using an escape route you spotted. You get +1 on all rolls while escaping via that route, but nothing more once you have escaped. You also get no bonus if you donâ€™t try to escape via the way you spotted.*
