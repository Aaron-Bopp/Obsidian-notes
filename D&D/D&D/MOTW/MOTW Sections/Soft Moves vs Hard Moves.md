You can use each Keeper move in one of two ways: as a “soft” move or as a “hard” move.

A **soft move** is one that threatens danger, or pushes the hunters in a certain direction, but there’s a way to a stop the danger, or divert it.

*For example: “The ice weasel races down the hall, teeth bared to rend!”*

This is a **reveal future badness** move, and gives the hunters something to react to—they can do something to prevent the danger, or ignore it and do something else instead.

A **hard move** doesn’t give the hunters a chance to react.

*For example: “The ice weasel shoulders your arm out the way, and its teeth bite deep into your shoulder, ripping through clothes, skin, and muscle. Take four harm.”*

This time it’s **inflict harm as established**, but because it’s used as a hard move, the hunter doesn’t have any chance to respond (or avoid suffering the harm).
