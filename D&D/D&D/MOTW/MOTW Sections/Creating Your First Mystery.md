Before each game, you’ll create a mystery for [[the hunters]] to investigate. Here’s how to build your first mystery.

If you want to skip this step, you can use either of the introductory mysteries: “Dream Away the Time” on [[0000500178]], or “Damn Dirty Apes” on [[0000863159]]. Then you can resume reading at “[[The First Session]]” on [[0000532303]] for advice on how to run the game.

A mystery is made up of six basic elements. You can create them in any order, but I’ll show you [[the order]] I usually use:

- A [[basic concept]] for the mystery.
- [[The hook]] that got [[the hunters]]’ attention.
- The monster.
- The [[minions]], [[bystanders]], and [[locations]] that are involved.
- The mystery countdown.
- Optionally: [[custom moves]] for special aspects of the mystery.

Before I get into the guts of it, here’s what a finished mystery looks like. Read it, and then I’ll talk about how the pieces fit together.
