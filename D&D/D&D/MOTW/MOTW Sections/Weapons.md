All weapons have some “tags” (i.e. lists of descriptions) that describe how they work. All weapons have a [[harm]] and range tag, that let you know how much [[harm]] an injury from it causes, and how far away the target can be.

*For example: Power drill (2-[[harm]] hand loud messy)*

*“2-[[harm]]” “hand,” “loud,” and “messy” are the tags. “2-[[harm]]” is the [[harm]] tag, “hand” is the range tag, and “loud” and “messy” are descriptive tags.*

Here’s what the tags mean:

- **1-[[harm]], 2-[[harm]], 3-[[harm]]**, etc: This is how much [[harm]] the attack inflicts.
- **area**: Can hit multiple foes. You may divide the [[harm]] you inflict among multiple targets.
- **balanced**: Easy to wield and keep your grip on.
- **barrier**: Does [[harm]] to anything that passes through. Counts as [[armour]] against any attacks that pass through it.
- **close**: Effective at fairly close quarters—outside arms’ reach, but not too far.
- **far**: Effective at long range.
- **fire**: Sets things on fire.
- **forceful**: Pushes things around, allowing you to “force them where you want them” in addition to normal attack effects.
- **hand**: Effective within arms’ reach.
- **life-drain**: Transfers life energy: the wielder is healed for as many points of [[harm]] as were inflicted. E.g. if you inflict 2-[[harm]], then you heal 2-[[harm]] from your injuries.
- **heavy**: This weapon is heavy and difficult to wield.
- **holy**: This will be more effective against [[monsters]] with a weakness to holy items.
- **ignore-[[armour]]**: Ignores protective [[armour]]. [[Armour]] has no effect on this [[harm]]. If [[armour]] has the magic tag, then the attack needs both ignore-[[armour]] and magic to bypass the [[armour]].
- **innocuous**: Doesn’t draw suspicion.
- **intimate**: Effective at the closest of quarters—within the embrace of your foe.
- **loud**: Loud enough that it draws attention.
- **magic**: Enchanted, and so can affect certain creatures and armours that are proof against normal weapons.
- **many**: These weapons are small enough you can carry a large number of them.
- **[a material]**: This weapon is made from the named material, and is thus useful against [[monsters]] with that weakness.
- **messy**: Spreads a lot of blood and gore around.
- **quick**: Fast to prepare and attack with, giving you a better chance of going first.
- **reload**: This weapon has limited ammunition, and may run out and need to be reloaded.
- **restraining**: A successful attack entangles or grabs the victim.
- **slow**: This weapon is slow to prepare and attack with.
- **small**: This weapon is tiny and easy to conceal.
- **unreliable**: This weapon needs regular cleaning and maintenance, otherwise it just isn’t gonna work.
- **useful**: This weapon has other uses aside from violence.
- **valuable**: This weapon is antique, or made of valuable materials.
- **volatile**: This weapon is dangerous and unstable.
