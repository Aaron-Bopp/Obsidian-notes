All weapons have some “tags” (i.e. lists of descriptions) that describe how they work. All weapons have a [[harm]] and range tag, that let you know how much [[harm]] an injury from it causes, and how [[far]] away the target can be.

*For example: Power drill (2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[loud]] [[messy]])*

*“2-[[harm]]” “[[hand]],” “[[loud]],” and “[[messy]]” are the tags. “2-[[harm]]” is the [[harm]] tag, “[[hand]]” is the range tag, and “[[loud]]” and “[[messy]]” are descriptive tags.*

Here’s what the tags mean:

- ![[x-harm]]
- ![[area]]
- ![[balanced]]
- ![[barrier]]
- ![[close]]
- ![[far]]
- ![[fire]]
- ![[forceful]]
- ![[hand]]
- ![[life-drain]]
- ![[heavy]]
- ![[holy]]
- ![[ignore-armour]]
- ![[innocuous]]
- ![[intimate]]
- ![[loud]]
- ![[magic]]
- ![[many]]
- ![[a material]]
- ![[messy]]
- ![[quick]]
- ![[reload]]
- ![[restraining]]
- ![[slow]]
- ![[small]]
- ![[unreliable]]
- ![[useful]]
- ![[valuable]]
- ![[volatile]]
