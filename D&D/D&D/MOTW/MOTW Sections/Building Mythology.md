[[As the game goes on]], over the course of [[many]] mysteries, keep building up the mythology of your world: the [[history]], logic, and rules behind why things are the way they are. What are the rules of [[magic]]? Why are these [[monsters]] out there? Who are the big powers that are conspiring against humanity?

This should develop naturally. As the world develops, you’ll find yourself thinking “Why did this monster do that?” or “Why does this mad cult leader want that?” The answers to questions like this will form the basis of your mythology.

To make the process easier, keep track of all the pieces you created with a mystery or added as you played. Keep the mystery sheets too. Track any loose ends, enjoyable threats, significant deaths, and other details that might be worth revisiting.

Look at the implications of each mystery: do they suggest something that should be part of your mythology? Maybe you’ve discovered a rule for [[magic]] or how [[monsters]] come to be? Or how these creatures operate, or what their ultimate goal is?

[[Arcs]] and mythology work [[hand]] in [[hand]]. How your mythology accretes will suggest the ways your [[arcs]] should play out. And the [[arcs]] will point at elements that ought to be part of the mythology.
