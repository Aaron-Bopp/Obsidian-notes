These are people who, often inadvertently, make it harder for [[the hunters]] to solve the mystery.

Think about your agenda and principles when you’re creating bystanders. Make sure each has something that they will want from [[the hunters]]. It works best if it’s something simple, like “go away and leave me alone,” or “save me.”

It’s useful to put some partially-defined bystanders into each mystery, with just a name and threat type. That way, when [[the hunters]] want to talk to someone you didn’t think of in advance, you can just use the next partial description (and fill in any extra details then and there).

There are nine bystander types:

- Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)
- Detective (motivation: to rule out explanations)
- Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)
- Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)
- Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)
- Official (motivation: to be suspicious)
- Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)
- Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)
- Witness (motivation: to reveal information)

Decide on the details the bystanders need:

- A name.
- A description.
- Bystander type and motivation. This may suggest what they will want from [[the hunters]].
- Optionally, a custom move.

Example Bystanders

Here are a couple of example bystanders. They’re a bit more detailed than you need for a single mystery: this level of description is for someone who is going to be a recurring character.

**HARVEY JONES, MONSTER INVESTIGATOR**

Harvey is a conspiracy theorist and cryptozoologist, just short of donning a tinfoil hat. If there’s a Flake on the team with the **net friends** move, maybe they even know Harvey (probably one of his pseudonyms).

**Bystander:** Detective (motivation: to rule out explanations).

If there’s monster activity in Harvey’s town, he’s going to be investigating it. He’s likely to get in the way of [[the hunters]], both directly and by annoying other people before [[the hunters]] get to them. He’ll be suspicious of [[the hunters]] (maybe even deciding they are Men in Black).

He can also be encountered investigating a mystery away from home: he could pick up on the same things that [[the hunters]] did and have worked out that a monster is active there.

**CHRISTINE FLEMING: SHE WOULD LIKE TO HELP**

Christine is an empathetic type, who will notice any of [[the hunters]] who have emotional baggage, and try to draw that out of them. It’s always better to talk things out, right?

**Bystander:** Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing).

Use Christine to give [[the hunters]] a whole different thing to worry about: someone trying to give them amateur psychological aid for their perceived emotional damage (chances are that she can find at least two members of the team who seem damaged).
