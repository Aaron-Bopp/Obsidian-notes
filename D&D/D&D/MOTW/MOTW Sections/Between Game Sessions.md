There’s a few things you need to do after each game session, and before the next. I’ll take you through those here.

In fact, you already started when you thought about what came up in the previous session that you could use later on. Going over the events of the last mystery provides you with ideas to use for the next mystery, or for new or existing arcs.

Most importantly, before the next game you will need to create a new mystery for the hunters to deal with. That works pretty much the same as the first one did.

I’ll discuss arcs here, and then how to create your later mysteries in the next chapter.
