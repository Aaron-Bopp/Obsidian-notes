If you want to run a single mystery (maybe as a convention game or for a change from a regular game), here’s what to do.

One-Shot Hunters

Use [[mystery letters]] to share background information [[the hunters]] should know. They can also be used to let them know any custom rules for creating their hunters (see below). If you’re not providing specific hunter playbooks, you can write letters that are aimed at different specialities: for example one for a brawler, one for a magician, one for an investigator.

[[The hunters]] should start with fewer [[Luck]] points: give them 1-3 (depending on how [[Tough]] you want the mystery to be). You may allow them to have a free level-up after creating their hunter, to make up for having fewer [[Luck]] points to save them.

It’s [[useful]] to pick a team concept for the game, and just tell everyone who the team are and how they operate. You may need to make certain playbooks mandatory, suggest others that fit in, and leave out others completely. For example, if your team concept is centered on [[The Professional]], having an Initiate might not work so well. Don’t offeThe Initiate playbook as an option.

I strongly advise that you let everyone make up their own hunter (even if you restrict the types available). Making all the choices during [[hunter creation]]—about their abilities, [[history]] and so on—gives the players a stake in the way the game is going to play.

You may reduce the options available in [[hunter creation]] to suit your mystery. You can do this with a mystery letter: include an instruction like “By the way, when you are picking your [[moves]], **this move** will be especially [[useful]] for this mystery, **that move** is not allowed, and **other move** will probably not be very relevant.”

One-Shot Mystery Creation

A twist or two works very well in a one-shot game. For example, give [[the hunters]] a hook that appears to be a classic monster (ghost, vampire, werewolf, etc), but which turns out to be something quite different.

You can make things easy on yourself if you bring a map of possible [[locations]], a list of names, and some pre-written [[bystanders]] (e.g. you can always find room for a suspicious cop and some naïve victims).

Without the expectation that the game will continue, you should also feel free to ramp up the danger level of [[the threats]]. You can have:

- more unnatural powers.
- more [[minions]], or multiple [[monsters]].
- higher damage attacks for [[monsters]] and [[minions]].
- higher [[harm]] capacity for [[monsters]] or [[minions]] before they are killed.
- threats target [[the hunters]], or their loved ones, directly.

Also, think about the scale of events. In a one-shot, the stakes of the mystery can be huge: zombie epidemics, the legions of Hell being unleashed on earth, hideous gods from beyond the stars—any huge threat is fair game.

If your team includes hunters with central story elements (the Chosen and her fate, [[The Wronged]]’s nemesis, [[The Professional]] and her AgencyThe Initiate and his Sect, etc) then tie those into the mystery as well. Think about these central elements when you decide which hunter books to bring to the table, and then you can leave the right-shaped holes in your mystery (e.g. you could leave yourself space to adjust [[the threats]] to match [[The Chosen]]’s fate). You should have time to do this as the other players make up their hunters: as they go, find out what they picked for their hunters, and you can quickly adjust your notes to fit, or suggest to the players things that work with what you have planned.

One-Shot Mystery Play

In general, follow the instructions for a first session.

Give everyone a [[quick]] introduction to the rules before they make their hunters. The idea of [[moves]] and what the ratings mean (0000059535) is enough. Explain other rules when you need them in the game.

Go a little easier on the questions, as you don’t need to build so much mythology from the answers.

You can also go much harder on [[the hunters]] in play. Push for more horror, and don’t [[hold]] back with the danger.
