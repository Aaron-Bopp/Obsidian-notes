Now come up with a hook for [[the hunters]]. That’s the mysterious event or clue that points to a supernatural problem. The hook is what came to [[the hunters]]’ attention: it needs to clearly point to the mystery.

The ideal hook screams “There is a monster here!” to a hunter, but would be easily dismissed by normal folks who don’t believe in [[monsters]]. It also suggests what sort of monster it might be.

*A family just moved into the haunted house and attracted the attention of the ghost. The house has been in the family for a long time, but uninhabited for many years. Local news reports have been running puff pieces about the haunting. Specifically, the family have heard strange noises, objects have been moved, and parts of the house are always cold. The articles mention the tragic suicide of Damian O’Connell in the house 42 years ago, after his wife Marie disappeared.*

[[The Threats]]

The hook is the clue that brought [[the hunters]] to this situation, such as something weird in the news that says “monster” to hunters but seems normal to those who aren’t in the know. For subsequent mysteries you can consider other sorts of hooks:

- If any of [[the hunters]] have a particular interest in a specific sort of monster or phenomenon, their research could find signs of suspicious activity.
- A bystander that [[the hunters]] have helped before might contact them if they encounter another monster.
- A monster that has reason to hate [[the hunters]] can come looking for them. The hook here might be the first attack on [[the hunters]].
- A clue that is similar to something [[the hunters]] have seen before, but with an important difference.
- Something [[the hunters]] have done might have drawn supernatural attention, so that the next mystery comes to them. The hook will be when things start getting weird.
- One of [[the hunters]] is told a prophecy or has a vision of what is going to happen (or is already happening).
- If [[the hunters]] are associated with an organisation (e.g., a Professional’s Agency or Initiate’s Sect) then they may be given the mission by their superiors.
