I’ve written the rulebook in [[the order]] that you’ll need as you play, with all [[the hunters]]’ information first and then [[the Keeper]]’s section after.

If you want to skip that and just hit the basics, here’s some suggestions:

- If you’re going to be Keeper, focus on [[the First Session]] section (The First Session): that covers what you need to prepare and what to do for the first game. It’s best to know [[the hunters]]’ basic [[moves]] (The Basic Hunter [[Moves]]) and playbooks (from The Playbooks), at least in passing
- If you’re going to play a hunter, read the hunter playbooks (from The Playbooks), and about [[moves]] (The Basic Hunter [[Moves]]) and ratings (Ability Ratings). Most important is to pick which hunter type(s) you want to play.
- If you’ve played *Apocalypse World* (or another game based on those rules, such as *Monsterhearts* or *Dungeon World*) then plenty here will be familiar. Check out ratings (stats in *Apocalypse World*) (Ability Ratings), playbooks (The Playbooks), and basic [[moves]] (The Basic Hunter [[Moves]]) to get a sense of the main differences. [[Luck]] is new (The [[Luck]] Counter). [[The Keeper]]’s (MC in *Apocalypse World*) agenda and principles (The [[Keeper Agenda]]), threats (0000465043), and [[moves]] (0000559527) are different, and mysteries (Creating Your First Mystery & 0000764334) and [[arcs]] (0000741446) take the place of fronts.
- If you’re an experienced roleplayer who hasn’t played *Apocalypse World* (the game these rules are adapted from), check out the hunter playbooks (The Playbooks) and the [[moves]] (The Basic Hunter [[Moves]]) and ratings (Ability Ratings). From there everything else should fall into place.
- If you want to run a game right away, skim “[[Running the First Mystery]]” (0000539124) and “On With the Mystery” (0000651380) and then read through “Dream Away the Time” on Introductory Mystery: Dream Away the Time. That should be enough to get you up and running. You can come back for more detail later.
