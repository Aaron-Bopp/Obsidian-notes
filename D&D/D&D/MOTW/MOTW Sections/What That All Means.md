That mystery writeup shows the level of detail you need to play the game. You also give [[the hunters]] a reason to come and investigate the situation and to deal with the monster(s) at the bottom of it. You start the game knowing what the monster’s doing, some important people and places, and with a plan about what will happen if [[the hunters]] don’t sort it out.

When you’re making up your own mystery, some of these elements will be defined in game terms to make it easier for you to manage them. I left the jargon out of the example, but I’ll describe each of the pieces now. These are the six mystery elements I mentioned before.
