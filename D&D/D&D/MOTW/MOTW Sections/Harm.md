When you take harm, the Keeper will tell you what happened and how many points of harm it was. Mark off that number of boxes on your harm track. There will be an additional effect: the Keeper will tell you what it is.

Injury severity depends on how much harm you have suffered:

- 0-harm wounds have only minor, short term effects.
- 4-7 harm wounds are serious and *unstable*. They will get worse unless treated. Mark the “Unstable” box.
- 8-harm or more will kill a normal human, including a hunter.
- Note that armour reduces the harm suffered by the number of points it is rated for.
