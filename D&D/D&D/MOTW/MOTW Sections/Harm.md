# When [[The Hunters]] takes harm
When you take harm, [[the Keeper]] will tell you what happened and how [[many]] points of harm it was. Mark off that number of boxes on your harm track. There will be an additional effect: [[the Keeper]] will tell you what it is.

Injury severity depends on how much harm you have suffered:

- 0-harm wounds have only minor, short term effects.
- 4-7 harm wounds are serious and *[[unstable]]*. They will get worse unless treated. Mark the “[[Unstable]]” box.
- 8-harm or more will kill a normal human, including a hunter.
- Note that [[armour]] reduces the harm suffered by the number of points it is rated for.

- [[UNSTABLE]]

# When [[The Keeper]] deals harm

Whenever a character (hunter, monster, minion, or bystander) gets harmed, note down the wound and how much harm was caused. For example, “clawed left arm, 3-harm” or “shot in the head, 2-harm.”

Remember that if the victim has [[armour]], that reduces the amount of harm suffered by its rating.

If it’s a hunter, tell them how [[many]] harm boxes to check off. Make sure you know if they’re up to four (after which the injuries become [[unstable]], and will get worse until treated).

Describe the pain, how bad the wound looks, how much blood is coming out, if a bone is sticking out, if they’re feeling faint, and so on. All the gory detail you can think of. This leads into which harm move affects them.

# The [[Harm]] [[Moves]]

Harm [[moves]] are used when a hunter, monster, minion, or bystander suffers injury of any kind (physical, magical, psychic, etc.). Pick a harm move based on how [[many]] points of harm were suffered and the details of the injury.

The harm [[moves]] are listed below, along with the minimum harm level for each.

0-harm or more:

- Momentarily inhibited.
- Drop something.
- Take -1 [[forward]].

1-harm or more:

- Fall down.
- Take -1 [[ongoing]].
- Pass out.
- Intense pain.

[[Unstable]] wounds:

- +1 harm.

8-harm or more:

- Dead.

## HOW TO USE THE [[HARM]] [[MOVES]]

Injuries must be as serious as they have been described in order to make the world seem real. Use the harm [[moves]] to help with that impression. Use a harm move whenever someone is hurt, to represent the immediate effects of the attack.

Think about each of the harm [[moves]] you could use, and whether any of the following might apply:

- **Is the wound bad enough that the victim might be knocked down?** [[Examples]] of wounds that might cause knockdown: a really strong hit; a hit with lots of inertia; an intensely painful wound; being hit in the legs.
- **Is the wound going to cause [[ongoing]] difficulty?** [[Examples]] of [[ongoing]] difficulty: intense pain; something got stuck in the wound; an irritant (dust, sand, gravel) gets in the wound; it’s somewhere distracting (like your [[hand]]).
- **Could the wound render the victim unconscious?** [[Examples]]: a blow to the head; shock from blood loss.
- **Is the wound going to be especially painful?** For example: burns; injuries to the hands or face; an existing injury is struck again.
- **Could the injury kill the victim?** [[Examples]]: blood loss; head trauma; chest or abdomen hits (which could rupture a major organ).


### [[MINIONS]], [[BYSTANDERS]] AND [[HARM]]

For [[minions]] and [[bystanders]], you don’t have to track wounds in detail. You can just make a call based on each injury: is this enough to take them out of the fight? Is this enough to kill them? Make the decision about the injury’s severity based on your usual Keeper’s agenda and principles, and (for [[minions]]) based on the harm capacity you picked for them.

[[Bystanders]], and some [[minions]], will be inclined to flee or surrender when injured rather than fight to the death.

### Killing [[Monsters]]

When you defined the monster, you picked the harm capacity it has. That’s how [[many]] points of harm it can take before it’s dying. You should inflict harm [[moves]] on [[monsters]] as normal whenever they are injured.

Monster injuries do not become [[unstable]] when they have taken four harm or more. [[The hunters]] will have to inflict all the harm themselves.

Additionally, recall that the monster is only *really* dead if [[the hunters]] used a weakness against it.

**WHEN A MONSTER ISN’T REALLY DEAD**

If [[the hunters]] deal enough damage to a monster to kill it (or enough to kill it several times over), but [[haven]]’t used a weakness, then that monster is not dead. One way or another, it will come back.

Here’s some ideas for ways a seemingly-dead monster can come back:

- The monster just keeps going, regardless of the terrible injuries it has sustained.
- The monster’s apparently dying body turns to dust, or mist, or shadow, and escapes.
- The monster returns in a new form (maybe as an even more dangerous spirit?).
- [[Fire]] (or acid, or [[whatever]]) simply has no effect on the injured monster.
- The monster reveals a new power, [[healing]] itself suddenly or overwhelming [[the hunters]].
- [[Minions]] [[hold]] [[the hunters]] back, while others grab and run off with the crippled monster.
- No matter what [[the hunters]] did to it, slowly the pieces of the monster make their way back together and rebuild themselves.
- [[Far]] away, [[minions]] begin a magical ritual to return the monster to life.
- The monster has tricked them: the thing that died was a fake (A magical illusion? A transformed minion?).
- The monster was just pretending to be almost defeated: as soon as [[the hunters]] drop their guard, it goes back on the offensive.

**KNOWING THE MONSTER IS DEAD**

When [[the hunters]] finally take down a monster, it needs to be really obvious.

Lots of [[monsters]] can disappear, turn invisible, and so on. That means that you should ensure a dying monster gets a good description of how it dies.

If a monster just falls over when [[the hunters]] inflict the final blow, that’s an anticlimax. But if it bursts in a huge spray of blood and gore, or explodes and takes down the building, or gets pulled screaming into another dimension?

Then everyone knows they properly killed it.
