Monsters are usually a lot harder to kill than humans. Minions (lesser supernatural creatures) can be as well.

All monsters (and some minions) have *weaknesses*. That means they cannot be killed until you use their weakness against them. How to use a weakness against a monster depends on what the weakness is.

Weaknesses can include:

- Things that can be used as a weapon: e.g. fire, cold iron.
- Specific methods of attack: e.g. a silver weapon, decapitation.
- Something to do: e.g. a magic ritual, a burial procedure.
- A harmful environment: e.g. sunlight, running water.

If you know the monster’s weakness, use it.

If you don’t know its weakness, find out using your moves.

If you don’t use a creature’s weakness, it will come back, even if you win the fight.

#whatsectionisthis

Whenever a character (hunter, monster, minion, or bystander) gets harmed, note down the wound and how much harm was caused. For example, “clawed left arm, 3-harm” or “shot in the head, 2-harm.”

Remember that if the victim has armour, that reduces the amount of harm suffered by its rating.

If it’s a hunter, tell them how many harm boxes to check off. Make sure you know if they’re up to four (after which the injuries become unstable, and will get worse until treated).

Describe the pain, how bad the wound looks, how much blood is coming out, if a bone is sticking out, if they’re feeling faint, and so on. All the gory detail you can think of. This leads into which harm move affects them.

The Harm Moves

Harm moves are used when a hunter, monster, minion, or bystander suffers injury of any kind (physical, magical, psychic, etc.). Pick a harm move based on how many points of harm were suffered and the details of the injury.

The harm moves are listed below, along with the minimum harm level for each.

0-harm or more:

- Momentarily inhibited.
- Drop something.
- Take -1 forward.

1-harm or more:

- Fall down.
- Take -1 ongoing.
- Pass out.
- Intense pain.

Unstable wounds:

- +1 harm.

8-harm or more:

- Dead.

**HOW TO USE THE HARM MOVES**

Injuries must be as serious as they have been described in order to make the world seem real. Use the harm moves to help with that impression. Use a harm move whenever someone is hurt, to represent the immediate effects of the attack.

Think about each of the harm moves you could use, and whether any of the following might apply:

- Is the wound bad enough that the victim might be knocked down? Examples of wounds that might cause knockdown: a really strong hit; a hit with lots of inertia; an intensely painful wound; being hit in the legs.
- Is the wound going to cause ongoing difficulty? Examples of ongoing difficulty: intense pain; something got stuck in the wound; an irritant (dust, sand, gravel) gets in the wound; it’s somewhere distracting (like your hand).
- Could the wound render the victim unconscious? Examples: a blow to the head; shock from blood loss.
- Is the wound going to be especially painful? For example: burns; injuries to the hands or face; an existing injury is struck again.
- Could the injury kill the victim? Examples: blood loss; head trauma; chest or abdomen hits (which could rupture a major organ).

**UNSTABLE WOUNDS**

Once a hunter has suffered 4-harm, their injuries become unstable. That means that it will get worse, until it’s properly treated.

While the injuries are unstable, you may tell the hunter they take another point of harm at any time. Use the same process as deciding which harm move to use: given the type and severity of the injuries, would it be likely to have gotten worse yet?

If an unstable wound has been left for a day and you haven’t added any more harm yet, do it then.

**MINIONS, BYSTANDERS AND HARM**

For minions and bystanders, you don’t have to track wounds in detail. You can just make a call based on each injury: is this enough to take them out of the fight? Is this enough to kill them? Make the decision about the injury’s severity based on your usual Keeper’s agenda and principles, and (for minions) based on the harm capacity you picked for them.

Bystanders, and some minions, will be inclined to flee or surrender when injured rather than fight to the death.

Killing Monsters

When you defined the monster, you picked the harm capacity it has. That’s how many points of harm it can take before it’s dying. You should inflict harm moves on monsters as normal whenever they are injured.

Monster injuries do not become unstable when they have taken four harm or more. The hunters will have to inflict all the harm themselves.

Additionally, recall that the monster is only *really* dead if the hunters used a weakness against it.

**WHEN A MONSTER ISN’T REALLY DEAD**

If the hunters deal enough damage to a monster to kill it (or enough to kill it several times over), but haven’t used a weakness, then that monster is not dead. One way or another, it will come back.

Here’s some ideas for ways a seemingly-dead monster can come back:

- The monster just keeps going, regardless of the terrible injuries it has sustained.
- The monster’s apparently dying body turns to dust, or mist, or shadow, and escapes.
- The monster returns in a new form (maybe as an even more dangerous spirit?).
- Fire (or acid, or whatever) simply has no effect on the injured monster.
- The monster reveals a new power, healing itself suddenly or overwhelming the hunters.
- Minions hold the hunters back, while others grab and run off with the crippled monster.
- No matter what the hunters did to it, slowly the pieces of the monster make their way back together and rebuild themselves.
- Far away, minions begin a magical ritual to return the monster to life.
- The monster has tricked them: the thing that died was a fake (A magical illusion? A transformed minion?).
- The monster was just pretending to be almost defeated: as soon as the hunters drop their guard, it goes back on the offensive.

**KNOWING THE MONSTER IS DEAD**

When the hunters finally take down a monster, it needs to be really obvious.

Lots of monsters can disappear, turn invisible, and so on. That means that you should ensure a dying monster gets a good description of how it dies.

If a monster just falls over when the hunters inflict the final blow, that’s an anticlimax. But if it bursts in a huge spray of blood and gore, or explodes and takes down the building, or gets pulled screaming into another dimension?

Then everyone knows they properly killed it.
