**USING [[MINIONS]]**

[[Minions]] are there to support and guard the monster. While [[monsters]] should be kept at a distance to start with, it’s fine for [[minions]] to be noticed and fought early in the mystery.

[[Minions]] can also be used to build up tension, giving [[the hunters]] a feeling of being surrounded by danger, or of constantly being watched.

Don’t have [[minions]] always fight to the death: they can flee, surrender, or offer a deal to be left alive or betray their master. This is especially true for human [[minions]].
