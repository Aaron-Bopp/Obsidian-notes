As well as a failed attempt to deal with a soft move, events in play can turn out so that a hard move is appropriate. Specifically:

- When [[the hunters]] [[hand]] you a golden opportunity
- When a hunter misses a roll (that is, rolls a 6 or less)
- When a hunter has used up all their [[Luck]].

*Handing you a golden opportunity* is a situation where, for example, the hunter says, “I leap down into the horde of zombies!” If you inflict 4-[[harm]] on them from zombie bites and clawing, that’s too bad: they knew what they were getting into.

*Missing a roll* (with a total of six or less) is *always* a time when you can make a hard move. The hunter’s screwed something up badly, so do [[whatever]] you need to. For example, if a hunter tries to **[[Protect Someone]]** and blows it, then you can inflict [[harm]] on the victim, maybe even kill them: make [[whatever]] was threatened come to pass.

The last one’s a different case. When *someone has used all their [[Luck]]*, they become ‘doomed’. This means you are allowed to make hard [[moves]] against them any time. For example, let’s say a hunter says “I’ll go check out the camp site” and you know the yeti have set up an ambush there. Normally it would make sense to give them a chance to spot this, for instance by asking if they want to **[[Read A Bad Situation]]** as they approach. But if the hunter is doomed (and doesn’t make a point of checking for danger), then you can choose to make a hard move, which means they only find out when two yeti grab them.

These situations are times when you are *justified* making as hard a move as you like. You don’t *have* to, but you can. Always refer back to your agenda and principles when you make these choices.
