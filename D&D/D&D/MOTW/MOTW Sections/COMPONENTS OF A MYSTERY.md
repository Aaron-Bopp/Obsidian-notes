**COMPONENTS OF A MYSTERY**

The *[[basic concept]]* is your original idea, the thought that led to this mystery.

*In the example, [[Building Arcs]] is the Mongolian death worms—the stories are awesome, so I wanted to make a mystery about them.*

The *hook* is whatever has drawn [[the hunters]]’ attention to the situation: reports of deaths or disappearances, a monster sighting, or some weird phenomena. You’ll tell [[the hunters]] up front what [[the hook]] is, but after that it’s totally up to them how they deal with what’s going on.

*In the example, [[the hook]] is the news reports of the first three deaths.*

Next there’s the *monster*. The monster has a type that defines its motivation, a description of what it looks like, what it can do, the attacks it can use in a fight with [[the hunters]], and some *powers* (its supernatural abilities). [[Monsters]] also have a *weakness*: until [[the hunters]] use the monster’s weakness against it, it cannot be destroyed.

*Mongolian Death Worms are [[monsters]]. They are* **beasts** (a specific style of monster in the game)*, which means they have the motivation “to run wild, killing and destroying.”*

*Powers:*

- ***Venom**: When* ***you are poisoned by a worm**, its venom will cause 1-[[harm]] every five minutes until the injury is stabilized or the affected area is flushed clean with water.*

*Attacks: Venom: 4-[[harm]] hand/close poison; Lightning blast: 3-[[harm]] close electricity stun.*

*Weakness: Water.*

Next up are *[[minions]]*. These are servants of the main monster, who help it out and work against [[the hunters]]. [[Minions]] also get a type and motivation to guide you about how they act.

*In the example, Dr Kelly Morrison is a minion. She’s a guardian, with the motivation “to bar a way or protect something.” She’s going to try and protect the worms as they nest and breed, because she wants to study and understand them.*

There’s also a list of *[[bystanders]].* These are the people involved in the situation. These can be people who are in danger, who might help [[the hunters]]’ investigation, who might get in the way. [[Bystanders]] each have a type and associated motivation.

*Dr Francesco Ferrara, is a* victim *with the motivation “to put herself in danger.” She’ll put herself in danger by helping [[the hunters]] as much as she can.*

*Detective Patrick Eagan is a detective, with the motivation “to rule out explanations.” If [[the hunters]] talk to him, they’ll quickly discover that the deaths were no normal accident or criminal attack.*

*Chris Larsen is an official with the motivation “to be suspicious.” He is there to get in the way of [[the hunters]] by bringing up annoying regulations they need to comply with, and that sort of thing. Just so [[the hunters]] don’t have too easy a time exploring the museum.*

Next up is one or more *[[locations]]* that will be important. [[Locations]] are allocated a type from a list. The type has a descriptive name and a motivation. [[Locations]] in this game are able to do things. The motivation tells you what sort of things this particular place will do.

*In the example, the one location is the Natural [[History]] Museum. It’s a **Wilds**, with the motivation “to contain hidden things.” The plan is to have it full of scary places, and fake-out scares, as well as people to protect and worms to hunt down.*

Those elements (*[[monsters]]*, *[[minions]]*, *[[bystanders]]*, and *[[locations]]*) are *threats*. *Threats* are the things that make trouble for [[the hunters]], one way or another. Each *threat* gets a *type* and a corresponding *motivation*.

Any kind of *threat* can have a *custom move*, too. This is a special rule that defines something this particular threat can do. See [page 296](#0000915624) for how to create [[custom moves]].

The last required element is a *countdown*. That’s what would happen if [[the hunters]] never dealt with this situation. I’ve summarized it in the final paragraph of the example, but when you’re making your own mysteries, you’ll note down six particular events that will happen unless [[the hunters]] prevent them.

That covers enough ideas and game-related notes to get started [[creating your first mystery]].
