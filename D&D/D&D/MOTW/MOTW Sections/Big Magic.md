Sometimes the everyday spells and rituals of the **[[Use Magic]]** basic move aren’t enough. **Big magic** covers everything more powerful, such as bringing someone back from the dead or opening a portal to another dimension. Big magic is both more powerful and more dangerous than the basic **[[Use Magic]]**.

Decide what magical effect you want to make happen, and tell [[the Keeper]]. They will determine what you must do in order to cast the spell. The options (and [[the Keeper]] can pick more than one) are:

- You need to spend a lot of time (days or weeks) researching the magic ritual.
- You need to experiment with the spell—there will be lots of failures before you get it right.
- You need some rare and weird ingredients and supplies.
- The spell will take a long time (hours or days) to cast.
- You need a lot of people (2, 3, 7, 13, or more) to help.
- The spell needs to be cast at a particular place and/or time.
- You need to **[[Use Magic]]** as part of the ritual, perhaps to summon a monster, communicate with something, or bar the portal you opened.
- It will have a specific side-effect or danger.

Once you know the requirements, you need to arrange them. Once you’ve done that, the magical effect you want will simply happen. You don’t need to roll any move for **big magic** itself, but you might need to roll some other [[moves]], as you try to meet the requirements.

Here are some [[examples]] of how you can use **big magic**.

*[[The hunters]] want to discover where a particular person is, with only a photograph to go on. [[The Keeper]] decides this will require three people to take part in the ritual, and that they need a very precise map of the area—the spell will guide a pendulum to the person’s location.*

*[[The hunters]] are investigating a frogbeast that’s been devouring people. After discovering it’s from an alien dimension, [[the hunters]] propose casting a spell that “detunes” it from our dimension and sends it home (or somewhere else, at least). [[The Keeper]] decides this will require a few experiments taking up the afternoon, the spell will take around six hours to cast, it requires them to **use** **magic** to banish the frogbeast from this dimension, and it will expose them to danger—the frogbeast will feel the spell being cast and know where the force is coming from.*

*One of [[the hunters]] on the team has died, and the others want to bring her back to life. [[The Keeper]] decides that it will take some weeks of research, the ritual requires her body, it must take place at dawn on the spring solstice in view of the rising sun, they must **[[Use Magic]]** to summon back the dead hunter’s soul from Death’s realm, and it exposes them to a big danger—Death will be angered by this transgression.*

The rules for the **[[Use Magic]]** move are constrained, but **big magic** is not. **Big magic** is for everything else, from curing someone of vampirism to opening a gate to another dimension.

The only limits on **big magic** are those that have been established in your game. For example, it may be that you decided magic never allows anyone to travel into the past.

Even these established rules might be broken if there is a strong enough reason in the story. For example, [[the hunters]] might realise that the *only* way to defeat a monster is to go back in time to when it was weaker. If you reveal that a limit can be broken in certain circumstances, think about what this reveals about the world. This sort of event should always be a big deal, with big repercussions in your story. In our time travel example, maybe travel into the past changes the timeline irrevocably; or maybe the rule being broken unleashes an angry time god on [[the hunters]].

When [[the hunters]] want to do **big magic**, you decide what it requires, the same as when someone uses magic normally. Once [[the hunters]] meet the requirements, the spell happens successfully, without a roll. Here are the options for requirements that you can choose from:

- Spend a lot of time (days or weeks) researching the magic ritual.
- Experiment with the spell—there will be lots of failures before you get it right.
- The hunter needs some rare and weird ingredients and supplies.
- It will take a long time (hours or days) to cast.
- The hunter needs a lot of people (2, 3, 7, 13, or more) to help.
- It needs to be done at a particular place and/or time.
- You need to **[[Use Magic]]** as part of the ritual, perhaps to summon a monster, communicate with something, or bar the portal you opened.
- It will have a specific side effect or danger.

You can pick multiple requirements, that all need to be satisfied:

*For example, you can tell [[the hunters]] “You need to spend a few days doing research and then get a lava snake fang to cast this spell. And then you’ll need three people to help you cast it.”*

You can also give [[the hunters]] alternatives:

*For example, you can tell [[the hunters]] “You need to spend a few days doing research for a simple version, or if you get a lava snake fang then you can cast it right now. Either way you need three people to [[Help Out]].”*

Make the requirements consistent with how big a deal this spell is going to be. Also, because the big magic does not require a roll for any move (except, incidentally, as part of meeting the requirements), you need to consider the perils and side effects of the spell and bring them into play as Keeper [[moves]].
