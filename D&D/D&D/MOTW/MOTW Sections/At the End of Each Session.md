# End of the First session

Once the mystery has been solved, take some time to go around the table and check that everyone’s happy with how it played out. If [[the hunters]] didn’t finish up this mystery, that’s okay too. Just finish when you or the group thinks it’s a cool time to put “To be continued...” up on the screen. You can find out what happens next time.

Then ask the [[End-Of-Session Experience Questions]]

It’s a good idea to let everyone revise aspects of their hunter now that they’ve played: they might want to change something now they’ve seen how the game works. Ask them if they have any more ideas about their hunter’s backstory, what their hunter’s planning to do next, what they thought of the mystery, and anything else they liked or didn’t like. Make a note of all the answers, for ideas you can use later.

Then you can let everyone go home, or go home yourself.

# End of each session
1. [[End-Of-Session Experience Questions]]
2. [[Summary Keeper's Session]]

# Getting Ready For Next Time

Make notes of all the stuff you might need to remember later:

- Elements from a hunter’s past.
- Friction in the hunter team.
- Themes with emotional resonance for [[the hunters]] or players.
- Ideas for [[monsters]] that might be particularly unsettling.
- [[Bystanders]] they might meet again.
- Any [[monsters]] that got away.
- Facts about how the world works in your game.

## Looking Ahead

Now think about events from the story that suggest there’s something bigger going on in the shadows. Answer the questions the events of the session help in [[Building Arcs]]
