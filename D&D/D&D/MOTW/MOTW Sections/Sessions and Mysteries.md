Most mysteries will fill one session of play, so that you can sit down for an afternoon or evening and play through a self-contained mystery. Of course, there’s plenty of ways to vary that if it doesn’t work for your group.

Some groups have short time slots by necessity, so you might need to break each mystery up over two or three sessions.

Alternately, if you have a longer block of time to play or just work through a mystery quickly, you might be able to get through two mysteries at a time.

Multi-Part Mysteries

You can build two-part mysteries, or even longer connected sequences.

For a two-part mystery, build it just like two normal ones, except that the end point of the first mystery (monster defeated and/or secret revealed) leads into the next one. That way you can end on a shock-reveal and tell everyone “to be continued...” If events in the game fall into place just right you might be able to end on a cliffhanger, but you can’t count on this.

The second mystery is probably best just sketched out, for you to complete once the first one is done. That way you will know which threats from part one are still around, and tailor the conclusion of the mystery based on what [[the hunters]] did in the first part.

Sometimes a mystery might just take longer to finish than expected. In these cases, you can stop in the midst of the action and say, “To be continued...” Before the next session, have another look at the remaining sections of the mystery and update them based on what has already happened, then continue the mystery from where you left off.

**LONGER MYSTERY SEQUENCES**

If you want to build a longer set of connected mysteries, the same process applies. A series of connected mysteries works well for an arc—you can just drop in the next adventure in the series now and again, the way that *The X-Files*, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and *Fringe* intersperse one or two episodes about the overarching plot amongst the usual monster-of-the-week episodes.

The more connected the mysteries, of course, the less you can assume in advance. Not knowing what [[the hunters]] will achieve in the coming mysteries, you’ll have to make the ones further in the future more vague. You might have a monster that is supposed to be a key player later on killed early, so bear in mind the need to be flexible and ready to change your plans depending on what happens in play.

Absences

I expect play to mainly be the same group of people meeting together to play out a series of mysteries. Real life doesn’t always allow that.

One of the advantages of the mystery-centered [[structure]] is that it allows some of the players to miss a game with minimal disruption. You can just say, “Oh, Owen is off hunting down something on his own this week, and can’t help you with this case.” Next time when the player is back you can ask what they were doing on their own (or write a mystery letter for them to cover it.)
