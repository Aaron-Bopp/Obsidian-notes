Sometimes your team concept will require additional stuff on top of the normal character creation options. This is stuff that enables the game to run smoothly. If you find yourselves saying, “It doesn’t make sense that we don’t have this,” and everyone agrees, then it’s a good candidate for customisation.

Decide as a group if any changes are needed, and what they will be. You can work these out at any point: it might come up right away when you pick your concept, or you might think of it later on.

Your concept might require:

- Equipment that isn’t in your playbook options. For example: your team concept has [[the hunters]] always on the move, but none of your playbooks include transport in the [[gear]] section. You can decide the team has a van to travel in.
- Something that can be written up as a custom move ([[0000915624]]). For example: the team concept is that you are all members of a secret organisation, so everyone starts with a version of [[the Professional]]’s **deal with the Agency** move ([[0000236873]]).
- New options when you level up ([[Leveling Up]]). For example: the team concept has a special mystical artifact for each hunter, but these artifacts’ powers are not initially available. Each hunter may choose to unlock one of their artifact’s powers when they level up.
