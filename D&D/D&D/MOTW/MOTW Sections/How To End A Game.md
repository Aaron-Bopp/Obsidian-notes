If you feel that things are moving towards a climax and resolution, it’s a good idea to talk to the rest of the group and mention that you feel that way. They’ll let you know if they agree, or if they think there’s still unfinished business to deal with.

If there is general agreement that it’s time to finish the game, make sure you plan the next few mysteries to suit. Have them be bigger in scope, more epic, and ensure the important [[arcs]] get resolved.

If there’s no agreement that it’s time to finish up and there’s enthusiasm to continue, that’s your cue to start thinking up some new [[arcs]] to replace the ones that have been dealt with, and maybe for some [[Hunter types]] to join the team.
