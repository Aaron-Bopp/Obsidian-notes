Vincent Baker’s *Apocalypse World* was built with hacking in mind. I don’t have a lot to add to the guidelines in that game, but as you may not own *Apocalypse World*, I’ll say a little about what to do if you want to take these rules and use them for something else.

The key things are [[the Keeper]]’s agenda and principles, and the basic [[moves]]. They are the most important dials that control how the game plays out.

The setting can be left mainly implicit. Use the playbooks, basic [[moves]], threats, and Keeper [[moves]] to provide the game’s setting. That allows each group to fill in the other details to suit themselves and their game.

If you want to compare and contrast, here are some other hacks of *Apocalypse World* that might be of interest:

- *Monsterhearts* by Avery Mcdaldno draws from a similar place to *Monster of the Week*, but it’s about the messy supernatural romance side of Buffy and *True Blood* (and *Twilight*). In particular, check out how the basic [[moves]] in *Monsterhearts* emphasise different ways of resolving conflicts to *Monster of the Week*.
- Avery also created *Simple World*, a framework for building your own game using rules based on *Apocalypse World*. It’s a really good place to start your hack.
- *Dungeon World* by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel is a modern take on classic dungeon crawl roleplaying.
- *Sagas of the Icelanders* by Gregor Vuga has [[moves]] and playbooks that reflect expected social roles.
- *World of Dungeons* by John Harper is an extremely cut down (but still perfectly playable) version of *Dungeon World.* It’s a great illustration of how little you can get away with.
