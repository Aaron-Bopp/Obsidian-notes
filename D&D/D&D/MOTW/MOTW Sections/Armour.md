Armour reduces the [[harm]] suffered by the wearer, by the number of points that it is rated for. For example, if you are wearing a leather jacket worth 1-armour, and a sewer mutant claws your arm for 3-[[harm]], you only suffer a 2-[[harm]] injury.

1-armour includes [[heavy]] leather jackets, motorcycle armour, bulletproof or stab-proof vests and other light but significant protection.

2-armour includes military body armour, police riot [[gear]], mediaeval mail, or other seriously bulky and highly effective protective [[gear]].

If armour has the [[magic]] tag, then normal [[weapons]] that have [[ignore-armour]] donâ€™t bypass the rating. Only [[weapons]] that have [[magic]] and [[ignore-armour]] will bypass [[magic]] armour.

Normally hunters can only get [[gear]] worth 1 or 2-armour. Armour worth more than that would be something very rare and special: perhaps ancient [[magic]], or the results of [[Weird Science]].
