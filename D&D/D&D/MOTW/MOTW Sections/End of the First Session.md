Once the mystery has been solved, take some time to go around the table and check that everyone’s happy with how it played out. If [[the hunters]] didn’t finish up this mystery, that’s okay too. Just finish when you or the group thinks it’s a cool time to put “To be continued...” up on the screen. You can find out what happens next time.

Then ask the end-of-session experience questions:

- Did we conclude the current mystery?
- Did we save someone from certain death (or worse)?
- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we learn something new and important about one of [[the hunters]]?

If you get one or two “yes” answers, have [[the hunters]] mark one experience. If you get three or four, they mark two.

It’s a good idea to let everyone revise aspects of their hunter now that they’ve played: they might want to change something now they’ve seen how the game works. Ask them if they have any more ideas about their hunter’s backstory, what their hunter’s planning to do next, what they thought of the mystery, and anything else they liked or didn’t like. Make a note of all the answers, for ideas you can use later.

Then you can let everyone go home, or go home yourself.

# Getting Ready For Next Time

Make notes of all the stuff you might need to remember later:

- Elements from a hunter’s past.
- Friction in the hunter team.
- Themes with emotional resonance for [[the hunters]] or players.
- Ideas for [[monsters]] that might be particularly unsettling.
- [[Bystanders]] they might meet again.
- Any [[monsters]] that got away.
- Facts about how the world works in your game.

## Looking Ahead

Now think about events from the story that suggest there’s something bigger going on in the shadows.

The sort of things that might have come up include:

- Hunters’ [[history]] choices that indicated a pattern of events or a significant incident.
- Events during the mystery that hinted at bigger troubles happening somewhere else.
- Unfinished business from the mystery.
- Hunter choices that have a wide reach, such as [[the Chosen]]’s fate, [[the Professional]]’s Agency, an[[The Initiate]]’s Sect.
- Anything that came up in play that suggested something more is going on, or that a secret is waiting to be uncovered. [[Examples]] include the results of [[the Expert]]’s dark past move, or someone saying something interesting about their past (e.g. Keeper: “Have you ever dealt with a snake demon before?” Hunter: “Oh, sure, we got a lot of them back on the farm.”)

If something like that came up, make a note.

You’ll use these notes to build subsequent mysteries and your [[arcs]] (arcs are long-term problems). If you’re already thinking about long-term problems and plots, go and read about [[building arcs]] ([[0000741446]]) and start your first one. It may not be totally defined yet: it could just be one or two threats and a couple of notes. That’s fine. You can develop and polish it as you go on.

If nothing springs to mind yet, wait until events in later mysteries give you some ideas.
