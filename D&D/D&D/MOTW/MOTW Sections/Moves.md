Moves cover situations when the game rules step in to help you determine what happens. If your hunter wants to do something that any normal person can do, then it just happens. Moves are used to determine what happens in cases where your hunter tries to do:

- something normal people can’t do, such as casting a magic spell
- something dangerous, such as getting into a fight with a monster
- something that’s more exciting if we don’t just decide the outcome on our own. For example, seeing if your hunter’s lie to a monster-attack victim has any repercussions.

Each move is triggered when a particular situation happens in the game. Look at when the move says it happens, and follow the instructions when you do it.

*For example, you need to use the move **protect someone** to save another hunter from a bone puppet’s attack. The move says **when you protect someone** from harm, roll +Cool, so you roll the dice and get a two and a five. That’s seven, plus your hunter has Cool +1 for a total of eight. The move’s instructions say that on a 7-9, you protect the target okay but you may suffer some or all of the harm instead.*

After you’ve recognised the move’s trigger, it will tell you want to do next. Moves can:

- ask you to roll the dice, with the results of the roll determining what happens next
- grant you a special ability that you can use whenever you want
- give you a bonus to certain rolls
- give you extra options to use in certain situations.

[[The Basic Hunter Moves]]

# For hunters
Hunters make moves to find the monster, and to defeat it. Moves are moments of danger and uncertainty. You never know quite how they’ll turn out.

Your hunter’s moves cover all the things you can do where the game’s rules get involved in the story.

Most of the time, you’ll be describing what your hunter says, where they go, or what they do without activating a move. That goes for everything that a normal person could do, in situations where failure would not be interesting and where there’s no particular danger.

In circumstances where a normal person couldn’t do what you want to do, or the drama of the story requires it, or it’s dangerous, that’s when the moves come in and control how well you do.

Here are some examples:

*Archer is checking out the site of a monster attack. There’s blood and guts all over the place, and police have walked in and out of the area. Archer starts trying to track where the monster went after the attack. When she makes the* ***investigate a mystery*** *move, what does she discover?*

*Chris realises that a ghul is sneaking up on him, so he gets out his sawn-off shotgun and blasts it in the face as it leaps for him. Does Chris get hurt? He makes the **kick some ass** move to find out how bad his injuries are and what happens to the ghul.*

*A roof-beam comes down on Ted as a giant spider smashes through the wall and scampers to freedom. Ted’s partner, Rainer, grabs a chair and tries to wedge the beam so there’s room for Ted to escape. Does she succeed? How badly is Ted hurt? Is he trapped? She needs to make the **act under pressure** move to find out.*

[[You Have To Make The Move]]

#  For Keepers
Moves cover situations when the game rules step in to help determine what happens.

Just as the hunters have basic moves and playbook moves, you have a set of basic Keeper moves. You also get moves that go with each type of threat, and harm moves for when someone (or something) gets hurt.

For the hunters, their moves cover specific cases. Hunter moves say that when a hunter does **this**, it is resolved like so. Your Keeper moves are more general, giving you broad but definite options.

To Do It, You Have To Do It

This is important: when you (or the hunters) make any move, you must describe how it happens.

Always say what is happening in the game, not just the rules side of things. Don’t tell someone “roll **act under pressure**!” tell them “the warlock’s gaze insinuates itself into your mind and as it hisses, ‘Kill your comrades,’ you feel an overwhelming urge to comply. What do you do?”

There’s a flip-side to this as well. When one of the hunters is doing something that is a move, make sure they follow the rules for that move. For example, if someone says “I go up to the park ranger and ask her ‘Did you see anything weird last Sunday night?’” then you should ask them to roll the **investigate** move before you decide how the ranger answers.

[[The Basic Keeper Moves]]

Each hunter type gets three moves as well. For many, one or two of these moves are mandatory.

Some of the moves don’t count as one against their count: that’s for moves that aren’t purely an advantage, but that have both a good and bad side[[The Initiate]]’s move when **in good standing with the Sect** is one of those: the move’s good and bad sides balance out, s[[The Initiate]] gets another three choices of purely useful moves.

Some playbooks have moves that are purely bad (the Monstrous’ curse and the Spooky’s dark side, for example). When a playbook has a purely bad move, give them an extra useful move to make up for it.

Not all the moves in the playbooks are explicitly called that, either. For example, the Expert’s haven is a move, but not referred to as one. Do this if your move is something special that doesn’t fit into the usual list of things the hunter can do.
