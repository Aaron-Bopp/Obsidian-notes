Start by coming up with a concept. Think about:

- Favourite [[monsters]] from myth, folklore, urban legend or popular culture.
- Loose ends from previous mysteries.
- The next problem from one of your [[arcs]] (see [[0000741446]]).
- Steal a plot from somewhere else and file off the serial numbers (by changing the location and/or type of monster).
- A place you’ve been, or know about, that has potential as somewhere a monster could be lurking.
- Any secrets [[the hunters]] found out and want to explore.
- [[Bystanders]] from old mysteries call [[the hunters]] for help.
- A monster [[the hunters]] failed to kill returns.
- Ambush [[the hunters]] with [[monsters]] of a type they’ve fought before.
- Return to the place a previous mystery happened.
- Create a different variety of [[monsters]] they have previously encountered.

Pick something that inspires you, then work out what’s going to be happening.

If your concept has a monster, what does it want to achieve?

If the concept has come from somewhere else, work out which monster(s) fit into it.

Using Your [[Arcs]]

You can use [[arcs]] in a few different ways to inspire your mysteries:

- Use aspects of the arc. Most obviously, the next event in the arc countdown could be the basis of a mystery. A mystery might also be connected tangentially to the arc, for instance if the [[arc threats]] have indirectly caused it.
- [[The hunters]] might investigate elements of an arc on their own initiative, so they might pre-empt the next countdown event.
- [[The threats]] from an arc might turn up as minor (or major) elements in a mystery. For instance, maybe a minion from the arc is an ally of the monster in your mystery?
- Clues referring to an arc can be found while investigating something else.
- While investigating a mystery, [[the hunters]] could be targeted by [[monsters]] or [[minions]] from an arc. Possibly this is a pre-emptive attack, or possibly [[the hunters]] are just in the way of something the creatures need to do.
