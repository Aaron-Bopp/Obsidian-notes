It’s good to work out why [[the hunters]] formed their team. You may have decided on this already. If not, have a [[quick]] discussion and see if you come up with an idea—even if it’s just a vague one.

The combination of playbooks you’ve selected may demand a particular team concept. Or it may seem like two (or more) teams of hunters have been mashed together (for instance, a family and a government agency)—in which case, it’s good to ask yourselves why they’re co-operating.

If nobody has any ideas, you can either work it out later on (after you have all made your hunters, and figured out your [[history]] together), or you can accept that this is a random collection of hunters: sometimes it’s okay to let things develop in play.

Don’t set your concept in stone yet. You’ll want to revise it as you make up your hunters, based on the choices you make along the way.
