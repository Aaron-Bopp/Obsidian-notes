# For hunters
**[[Manipulate Someone]]** does not normally work on [[monsters]], even if they can reason and talk. You can try and make a deal with one if you really want, but you don’t get to roll to ensure it keeps its side of the bargain. You just have to hope it’s an honourable fiend. Good [[luck]] with that.

If you take [[the Monstrous]] move **[[Dark Negotiator]]** (or any other move that specifically allows it) then you are allowed to manipulate [[monsters]], at least if they can reason and talk. Of course, a monster probably needs a different sort of reason than normal people—quite possibly something you really won’t want to do.

[[Minions]] may or may not be susceptible to manipulation. It may be possible to manipulate [[minions]] who are human, or almost human; those that are incapable of understanding or reason cannot be manipulated.

# For keepers
By default [[the hunters]] can’t manipulate [[monsters]]. Even if a monster can talk and reason, it cannot be trusted to keep its word. You should certainly allow [[the hunters]] to make a deal with a monster, if they try to, but they do not get to roll **[[Manipulate Someone]]** and they certainly will not get a guarantee that the monster will [[hold]] up its end of the bargain. From the monster’s point of view, hunters wanting to make a deal are probably in a weak position so this is a great opportunity to take advantage of them.

The only exception is when a hunter move explicitly allows it (such as [[the Monstrous]] move **[[Dark Negotiator]]**). If a hunter has a move allowing this, then **manipulate** works as normal (although what a monster wants in return could be quite unpleasant).

[[Minions]] may or may not be vulnerable to manipulation. If the minion is a normal human working for a monster, then hunters can manipulate them fine. The other extreme are [[minions]] who can’t understand speech and may not be capable of making deals, such as brain-eating zombies or a malevolent fungus. Make decisions for the in-between cases as they come up, and remember that the minion might want something nasty in return for doing what the hunter asks.
