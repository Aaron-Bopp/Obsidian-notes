This book is split into two main sections, *The Hunters* and *The Keeper*. Each section contains the rules for the corresponding player role. It’s helpful for [[the Keeper]] to be familiar with how the rules work for hunters as well as for their own Keeper responsibilities. There’s also no reason for other players to avoid [[the Keeper]]’s section (there are no spoilers there, except in the example mysteries) if you want another perspective on the rules.
