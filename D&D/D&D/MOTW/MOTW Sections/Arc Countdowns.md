Arc countdowns are like [[mystery countdowns]], except they are on a bigger scale.

Aim for each step of [[the countdown]] to have the potential to be a whole mystery (either with [[the hunters]] attempting to stop it, or dealing with the aftermath).

*For example:*

*The arc countdown for our werewolf revenge arc is going to center on Nina and George getting ready to take out [[the hunters]].*

- **Day:** *Nina consolidates her [[hold]] over New Hampstead and creates a bunch of new werewolves.*
- **Shadows:** *The pack begins sending out spies to find [[the hunters]] and assassins to kill [[the hunters]]’ loved ones and support network.*
- **Dusk:** *George decides to target [[the Wronged]], by hunting down her family (aiming to turn them into werewolves, rather than “just” kill them).*
- **Sunset:** *The pack makes a concerted assault on [[the hunters]] and takes them out.*
- **Nightfall:** *The pack kills any other monster hunters who are active in the region, and begins turning people in positions of authority.*
- **Midnight:** *Nina rules the whole region through the pack.*

Note that this countdown needs to be created a little differently than usual. Because the arc was triggered by [[the hunters]]’ actions, it’s not what would happen if they never got involved. They’re already involved! So this one is what will happen if [[the hunters]] don’t find out about Nina and the werewolves, or if [[the hunters]] do not stop Nina’s plan in time.
