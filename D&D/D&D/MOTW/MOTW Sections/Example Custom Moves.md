Here are a bunch more [[examples]] to show you the sorts of [[moves]] you might create. I’ve put the trigger of the move in **bold**, so you can see when it applies. Then I’ve explained more reasons for creating the move that way, and the effect I intend.

An Aura Of Terror

*An ancient wraith has an aura of terror. **Anyone within 5 metres of the wraith** takes -1 [[ongoing]], unless they **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to resist the fear.*

This is a penalty move, triggered by being [[close]] to the monster. It’s designed to make attacking the ghost up [[close]] harder, which may get [[the hunters]] thinking of alternative ways to defeat it.

Knows It Like The Back Of His [[Hand]]

*Ed O’Grady (bystander: witness) is a keen walker, and knows the woods and hills nearby like the back of his [[hand]]. If you **ask his advice** on the terrain or how to find somewhere, [[hold]] 1 that you can spend to get +1 on any roll you make following his directions.*

This is a bonus move, something to mark out this particular bystander as someone worth paying extra attention to.

The Infernal Hunting Pack

*This hunting pack of thirteen infernal hounds (minions: brutes) serve a demon lord. The hounds may **mark someone for death** with a bite. The marked person is then allowed to escape, but the pack will know the location of a marked person forever.*

This is a special-effect move, triggered by the hounds biting a person. This move adds a long-term problem that could remain in play even after the current mystery is solved.

Searching The Marshes

*When you* ***search in the marshes*** *(location: maze) roll +[[Sharp]]. On a 10+ things seem to point somewhere in particular: take +1 [[forward]] for investigating. On a 7-9, you can investigate, but then you must pick one of the bad things below. On a miss, all three bad things are true.*

*Bad things that can happen in the marshes:*

- *Something is following you.*
- *You are lost, and your phone and GPS are not working properly.*
- *You stumble upon something abominable.*

Searching the marshes is a roll move. It is designed to make the marshes a bit more exciting than a usual location threat. By making it a roll, you make the player pick what happens. This gives them a bit more of a stake in the situation (plus it can be exciting just knowing there’s a special move to roll).

Nightmares

*When **you go to sleep in this town**, count how [[many]] times you have slept here and roll +sleeps. On a 10+, you have nightmare visions of what is to come and you know it can’t be stopped: you must **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to break out of your despair and actually do something about the visions. On a 7-9 you have nightmare visions of what’s coming, but that’s all. On a miss, you sleep like a baby.*

This move belongs to the location threat that describes the town. It is another roll type move, that tells [[the hunters]] that this town is in big trouble, and they need to sort it out before too [[many]] nights pass.

Calling The Flame Spirits

Here’s a move for a hunter who made the **[[Use Magic]]** move a lot for a particular effect, so we decided to make a custom move for that spell.

*When you **call the flame spirits** you need to spill some very strong liquor into a [[fire]] and call the spirits by name (as [[many]] or as few names as you want). Roll +[[Weird]]. On a 10+ all the spirits you named come, and they’ll tell you some specific things and burn anything you want. On a 7-9 one of them comes and tells you some obscure things and then it burns some stuff, mostly what you wanted burned. On a miss, the [[fire]] spirits are angered. They might refuse your summons for a long time, or some of them might appear and demand a significant sacrifice from you right now, or else.*

This is another roll move, designed to be a slightly different version of **[[Use Magic]]** that deals with this particular spell. Note that it is safer, but a lot more specific, than the **[[Use Magic]]** move.

Inaccurate Memories

Here’s a move for a mystery that deals with a monster that can dominate people’s minds.

*When a hunter **questions someone who has seen the monster**, they get told one of these in addition to any normal questions and answers:*

- *They say something that directly contradicts a fact [[the hunters]] already know (e.g. “I was at work” when they know she wasn’t).*
- *They can’t remember that time at all.*
- *They can remember the time, but their memory is an obvious fabrication (e.g. “After I got home I had dinner, watched some TV, then I had dinner”).*

This is a special-effect move. The obvious contradictions here are a way to let [[the hunters]] know that the monster they are after can get into people’s minds and change their memories, or make them lie, or something like that.

Checking Out An Agency Facility

Here’s a move for an arc. It goes with an arc about a Professional’s Agency.

*When you **explore an Agency facility** it counts as **investigating a mystery**, but you can also ask these questions:*

- *What do I find out about the Agency’s real goals?*
- *Who do I find out something suspicious about?*

This is a special-effect move, adding some extra options for investigation that bear on specific issues that have come up in [[the hunters]]’ previous investigation of the Agency (and a similar move in your game would have questions tailored to what’s already happened to your hunters). You add more questions later, if [[the hunters]] come up with other things they want to look for.
