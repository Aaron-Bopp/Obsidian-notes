This is used when you are fighting something that’s fighting you back.

When you get into a fight and **kick some ass**, roll [[+Tough]].

On any success (i.e., total 7 or more) you and whatever you’re fighting inflict [[harm]] on each other. The amount of [[harm]] is based on the established dangers in the game. That usually means you inflict the [[harm]] rating of your weapon and your enemy inflicts their attack’s [[harm]] rating on you.

You can take seven [[harm]] before you die.

If you roll a 10+, choose one extra effect:

- You gain the advantage: take +1 [[forward]], or give +1 [[forward]] to another hunter.
- You inflict terrible [[harm]] (+1 [[harm]]).
- You suffer less [[harm]] (-1 [[harm]]).
- You force them where you want them.

On a miss, you get your ass kicked instead. You suffer [[harm]] or get captured, but don’t inflict any [[harm]] back.

This is the basic fighting move, covering the back and forth of a short burst of fighting, rather than a single attack.

By default when a hunter **kicks ass** both sides inflict [[harm]] as established—the hunter with their weapon and the enemy theirs. The precise amount of [[harm]] that’s traded will depend on what’s happening at that moment in the fight.

*For example, Hoss the hunter is going to shoot a zombie with his shotgun (harm-3 close load messy reload), while the zombie is trying to bite Hoss (the zombie’s bite attack is rated “2-[[harm]] hand”). If the zombie is still out of reach (i.e. out of hand range), Hoss will inflict 3-[[harm]] on it but be safe from the zombie’s bite. Once the zombie is right up in Hoss’s face, then Hoss can still blast it for 3-[[harm]] and this time the zombie can bite him back for 2-[[harm]].*

Don’t automatically call for this move any time a hunter attacks something. If a hunter attacks a foe that cannot (or will not) fight back, then it is appropriate to just use [[the Keeper]] move **inflict [[harm]] as established** instead. What the hunter’s doing could also be a move like **[[Protect Someone]]** or **[[Act Under Pressure]]** (or another move altogether): use what the player has stated the hunter’s intentions are and the actions they’ve described the hunter taking to determine what makes sense.

On a success of 10+, the hunter gets to pick an extra effect. Always ask them what happened.

If the hunter takes +1 [[forward]], or gives another hunter +1 [[forward]], then make sure to ask them what they did to set up an advantage. This might include things like tactical maneuvering, grappling with the enemy, pushing the enemy back, or knocking the enemy off balance.

If the hunter inflicts terrible [[harm]], then they inflict one more point of [[harm]]. That means they did something extra-nasty with their attack, so be sure to ask them what that was.

If the hunter suffers less [[harm]], then reduce the [[harm]] the enemy inflicts by one. Ask them what they did to reduce the [[harm]].

If the hunter forces the enemy where they want them, this will allow them to push the bad guys wherever they want. Be generous with this, as long as it’s consistent with what is happening in the game: you can’t drive the [[monsters]] out if they’re in a dead end, for instance.

When a hunter misses on **kick some ass**, they’re usually going to be in a lot of trouble. Your move doesn’t always have to be **inflict [[harm]] as established**. Sometimes your other [[moves]] can apply too: maybe the hunter gets captured, or the monster gets a chance to flee the fight.
