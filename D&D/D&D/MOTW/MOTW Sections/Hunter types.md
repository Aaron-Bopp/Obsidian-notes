The hunter types are:

- **[[The Chosen]]**: a once-ordinary person who discovered they have a special destiny, and who has been given the power to accomplish it. [[The Chosen]] is good in a fight, with some [[Weird]] powers. E.g. Buffy from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer.* See 0000068181.
- **[[The Crooked]]**: a criminal turned monster hunter, haunted by their past and enemies. [[The Crooked]] is good in social situations and has a lot of contacts. E.g. Anna Valmont from *The Dresden Files*, Peter Bishop from *Fringe*. See [[The Crooked]].
- **[[The Divine]]**: an agent of a higher power, with a mission to fulfill. [[The Divine]] is very [[Tough]] and has been granted [[holy]] powers. E.g. Castiel from *Supernatural*; Michael Carpenter from *The Dresden Files*. See [[The Divine]].
- **[[The Expert]]**: the hunter who knows all about [[monsters]] and [[magic]]. [[The Expert]] knows a lot of hidden secrets and how to find out more, and also has a well-supplied base to work from. E.g. Bobby Singer from *Supernatural*; Rupert Giles from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Expert]].
- **[[The Flake]]**: a conspiracy theorist. [[The Flake]] is great at finding things out and seeing how the events of separate mysteries are connected. E.g. Agent Mulder or the Lone Gunmen from *The* *X-Files*. See [[The Flake]].
- **[[The Initiate]]**: a member of an ancient monster-slaying Sect, trained to fight and Use MagicThe Initiate is good with [[magic]], and their Sect provides help (and sometimes problems). E.g. The Wardens from *The Dresden Files*; Annelise from the *Twenty Palaces* series. See [[The Initiate]].
- **[[The Monstrous]]**: a monster fighting for the good guys. [[The Monstrous]] is very [[Weird]], and can have a variety of different powers based on what monster breed they are. E.g. Angel from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and *Angel*; Bill Compton from *True Blood* (0000189800).
- **[[The Mundane]]**: just a normal regular person, especially good at dealing with regular people you meet and have to save, and at getting captured by [[monsters]] (which can be more [[useful]] than you might expect). E.g. Xander or Cordelia from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Mundane]].
- **[[The Professional]]**: you work for an agency that hunts [[monsters]]. [[The Professional]] is good in a fight, and a good team player. E.g. Riley and the Initiative from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*; Olivia Dunham from *Fringe*. See [[The Professional]].
- **[[The Spell-slinger]]**: a trained wizard, wielding powerful [[magic]] in their crusade against evil. [[The Spell-Slinger]]’s arcane training gives them an advantage when dealing with eldritch secrets. E.g. Harry Dresden from *The Dresden Files*; Willow from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, in the later seasons. See [[The Spell-Slinger]].
- **[[The Spooky]]**: has psychic or magical powers. These powers are strange and sinister ... and not completely under [[The Spooky]]’s control. E.g. Sam Winchester from *Supernatural*; Willow from earlier seasons of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Spooky]].
- **[[The Wronged]]**: revenge-driven, and really [[Tough]]. [[The Wronged]] is all about killing a specific breed of monster and protecting others as you do it. E.g. Dean and John Winchester from *Supernatural*. See 0000295092.
- **[[The Gumshoe]]:** The supernatural is just another case for this private eye to solve. A [[Tough]], ethical charmer, this shamus is in the fictional tradition that stretches from classic noir characters like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe to the modern Jessica Jones and Lisbeth Salander. 
- **[[The Hex]]:** A witch motivated by the pursuit of forbidden power, using [[magic]] more readily—and more recklessly—than other hunters. E.g. Willow during season six of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* 
- **[[The Pararomantic]]:** A hunter with a loving—but difficult— relationship with a supernatural being. Understands [[monsters]]’ intentions and can earn their trust, but puts their own heart, and even mortality, at risk. E.g. Elena Gilbert from *The Vampire Diaries*, Belle from *Beauty and the Beast*.
- **[[The Searcher]]:** After an encounter with weirdness, they dedicated their life to investigating the unexplained. Very strong investigator, especially at working out what sort of thing is going on. Not really a fighter, but has some defensive options. E.g. Roy Neary in *[[Close]] Encounters of the Third Kind*, or (historically) Charles Fort.

The currently available hunters include:

- **The Action Scientist**. Just like it says, a scientist ready for action and dealing with [[monsters]]. Directly inspired by *Atomic Robo*.
- **The Big Game Hunter**. An expert hunter who has decided to hunt [[monsters]] for the thrill of the chase rather than the need to protect.
- **The Constructed**. A built being, now free of its maker. Inspired by Frankenstein’s monster.
- **[[The Exile]]**. A monster hunter from the past who has been transported to the present day.
- **[[The Hard Case]]**. The toughest, hardest to kill fighter. E.g. Ray Lilly from the *Twenty Palaces* series or Owen Pitt from the *Monster Hunter International* series.
- **The Luchador**. A heroic masked wrestler, fighting to protect the innocent between matches.
- **The Mad Scientist**. A crazy scientist who has seen the error of their ways and is now working for good. So they say, anyhow.
- **[[The Meddling Kid]]**. Jinkies! I think there’s something more going on here, and old man Smithers seems to be involved! E.g. Scooby-doo and the Scooby gang.
- **[[The Sidekick]]**. They worship another hunter on the team, and is good at helping them out. And one day, they’ll be just as good as their hero. E.g. Garth from *Supernatural*.
- **[[The Snoop]]**. A journalist looking for the real story behind [[Weird]] events. Great at finding stuff out, terrible at fighting. E.g. The Ghostfacers from *Supernatural*.
- **[[The Summoned]]**. A creature summoned to end the world but who has decided they do not want to do that. Lots of [[Weird]] powers, dangerous, and hard to kill. E.g. *Hellboy*.

Most of these are available on the *Monster of the Week* website.
