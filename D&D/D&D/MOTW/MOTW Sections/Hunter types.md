The hunter types are:

- **The Chosen**: a once-ordinary person who discovered they have a special destiny, and who has been given the power to accomplish it. The Chosen is good in a fight, with some weird powers. E.g. Buffy from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer.* See [[0000068181]].
- **The Crooked**: a criminal turned monster hunter, haunted by their past and enemies. The Crooked is good in social situations and has a lot of contacts. E.g. Anna Valmont from *The Dresden Files*, Peter Bishop from *Fringe*. See [[The Crooked]].
- **The Divine**: an agent of a higher power, with a mission to fulfill. The Divine is very tough and has been granted holy powers. E.g. Castiel from *Supernatural*; Michael Carpenter from *The Dresden Files*. See [[The Divine]].
- **The Expert**: the hunter who knows all about monsters and magic. The Expert knows a lot of hidden secrets and how to find out more, and also has a well-supplied base to work from. E.g. Bobby Singer from *Supernatural*; Rupert Giles from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Expert]].
- **The Flake**: a conspiracy theorist. The Flake is great at finding things out and seeing how the events of separate mysteries are connected. E.g. Agent Mulder or the Lone Gunmen from *The* *X-Files*. See [[The Flake]].
- **The Initiate**: a member of an ancient monster-slaying Sect, trained to fight and use magic[[The Initiate]] is good with magic, and their Sect provides help (and sometimes problems). E.g. The Wardens from *The Dresden Files*; Annelise from the *Twenty Palaces* series. See [[The Initiate]].
- **The Monstrous**: a monster fighting for the good guys. [[The Monstrous]] is very weird, and can have a variety of different powers based on what monster breed they are. E.g. Angel from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* and *Angel*; Bill Compton from *True Blood* ([[0000189800]]).
- **The Mundane**: just a normal regular person, especially good at dealing with regular people you meet and have to save, and at getting captured by monsters (which can be more useful than you might expect). E.g. Xander or Cordelia from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Mundane]].
- **The Professional**: you work for an agency that hunts monsters. The Professional is good in a fight, and a good team player. E.g. Riley and the Initiative from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*; Olivia Dunham from *Fringe*. See [[The Professional]].
- **The Spell-slinger**: a trained wizard, wielding powerful magic in their crusade against evil. The Spell-slinger’s arcane training gives them an advantage when dealing with eldritch secrets. E.g. Harry Dresden from *The Dresden Files*; Willow from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, in the later seasons. See [[The Spell-Slinger]].
- **The Spooky**: has psychic or magical powers. These powers are strange and sinister ... and not completely under the Spooky’s control. E.g. Sam Winchester from *Supernatural*; Willow from earlier seasons of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. See [[The Spooky]].
- **The Wronged**: revenge-driven, and really tough. The Wronged is all about killing a specific breed of monster and protecting others as you do it. E.g. Dean and John Winchester from *Supernatural*. See [[0000295092]].
There are some extra playbooks out there, some official and others fan-made. You can find advice on making your own on [[0000935239]].

The currently available hunters include:

- **The Action Scientist**. Just like it says, a scientist ready for action and dealing with monsters. Directly inspired by *Atomic Robo*.
- **The Big Game Hunter**. An expert hunter who has decided to hunt monsters for the thrill of the chase rather than the need to protect.
- **The Constructed**. A built being, now free of its maker. Inspired by Frankenstein’s monster.
- **The Exile**. A monster hunter from the past who has been transported to the present day.
- **The Hard Case**. The toughest, hardest to kill fighter. E.g. Ray Lilly from the *Twenty Palaces* series or Owen Pitt from the *Monster Hunter International* series.
- **The Luchador**. A heroic masked wrestler, fighting to protect the innocent between matches.
- **The Mad Scientist**. A crazy scientist who has seen the error of their ways and is now working for good. So they say, anyhow.
- **The Meddling Kid**. Jinkies! I think there’s something more going on here, and old man Smithers seems to be involved! E.g. Scooby-doo and the Scooby gang.
- **The Sidekick**. They worship another hunter on the team, and is good at helping them out. And one day, they’ll be just as good as their hero. E.g. Garth from *Supernatural*.
- **The Snoop**. A journalist looking for the real story behind weird events. Great at finding stuff out, terrible at fighting. E.g. The Ghostfacers from *Supernatural*.
- **The Summoned**. A creature summoned to end the world but who has decided they do not want to do that. Lots of weird powers, dangerous, and hard to kill. E.g. *Hellboy*.

Most of these are available on the *Monster of the Week* website.
