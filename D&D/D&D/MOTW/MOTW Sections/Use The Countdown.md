Mark off the steps on the countdown if the corresponding event happens in play, or when you decide it has now happened off-screen.

Advancing the countdown isn’t one of your moves by itself, but it represents a move that was just made or is about to be made. Good times to advance the countdown are:

- you **announce off-screen badnes**s that warns about the event about to happen, or shows that it is happening now.
- a hunter blows an **investigate** move that could have led to finding out about the next event.
- you make a move for a threat that completes the next event.
- a hunter misses a move roll attempting to stop the next event.

As the countdown is what would happen if the hunters didn’t interfere, you will usually need to revise the plan based on what happens in play. The hunters might prevent something directly, or the monster might change its plans in response to what the hunters do. Maybe some of the events will be changed, or maybe some will be skipped, or they could all become irrelevant. That’s fine. The important thing is that the countdown provides you with a guide to what the bad guys are trying to do.
