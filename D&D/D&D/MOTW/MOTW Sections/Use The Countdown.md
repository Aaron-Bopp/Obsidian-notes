Mark off the steps on [[the countdown]] if the corresponding event happens in play, or when you decide it has now happened off-screen.

Advancing [[the countdown]] isn’t one of your [[moves]] by itself, but it represents a move that was just made or is about to be made. Good times to advance [[the countdown]] are:

- you **announce off-screen badnes**s that warns about the event about to happen, or shows that it is happening now.
- a hunter blows an **investigate** move that could have led to finding out about the next event.
- you make a move for a threat that completes the next event.
- a hunter misses a move roll attempting to stop the next event.

As [[the countdown]] is what would happen if [[the hunters]] didn’t interfere, you will usually need to revise the plan based on what happens in play. [[The hunters]] might prevent something directly, or the monster might change its plans in response to what [[the hunters]] do. Maybe some of the events will be changed, or maybe some will be skipped, or they could all become irrelevant. That’s fine. The important thing is that [[the countdown]] provides you with a guide to what the bad guys are trying to do.
