One thing that [[the Keeper]] definitely does *not* do is decide what is going to happen to [[the hunters]]. You’ll prepare the situation that they’re coming in to investigate, and you’ll think about what would happen if they didn’t come.

But once you sit down to play your mystery with [[the hunters]], then everything is up to them. They get to choose which places they visit, which people they talk to, how they chase down the monster, and everything else.

Your preparation gives you a sketch of what’s going on, just enough for you to work out how everything will react to what [[the hunters]] do.

It’s fine to speculate about what is likely to happen. Say if you have a hunter who is likely to be sympathetic to a particular person in the mystery, you can go ahead and think about some possible things that might happen because of that. Or perhaps you set up a place because you are sure that [[the hunters]] will track the monster down there and have a big fight. That sort of thing is fine: just as long as you remember it’s only a *possible* outcome.

What you should not do is *force* the story to go a certain way. Instead, let [[the hunters]] do [[whatever]] they want, in the situation you have set up for them.
