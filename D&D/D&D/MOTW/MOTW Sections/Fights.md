Here are some things to remember when you get down to the slaying.

Don’t always go right to rolling dice for **kick some ass**. That move puts you in danger of [[harm]] as well as your enemy. If you can find a way to attack *without* putting yourself in danger, then you can inflict [[harm]] on the enemy without suffering any yourself (and without needing to succeed on a roll).

Remember you can try to **protect someone** whenever they are threatened with [[harm]]. Think about who needs protecting, and where everyone is in relation to each other. If you set things up right, you might even be able to save a teammate from the [[harm]] they’re going to suffer if they miss a roll.

Remember that you can **help another hunter** to give them +1 on a roll. This can sometimes be the difference between life and death, plus if you help in a fight [[the Keeper]] might say you can add the [[harm]] from your attack to the attack of the hunter you’re helping—so you can take a monster down faster.
