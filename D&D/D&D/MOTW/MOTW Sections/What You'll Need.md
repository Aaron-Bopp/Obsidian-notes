The game works best with three to five people, with one of you acting as Keeper. It works with more or less people, too, but there will be a corresponding change to how much time each person gets in the spotlight.

Make sure you have:

- copies of the hunter playbooks (each of these is a rules reference and record sheet for your hunter)
- enough hunter reference sheets to go round
- a Keeper reference sheet
- one mystery sheet for [[the Keeper]], or an introductory mystery to play (there’s one [[Introductory Mystery: Dream Away the Time]])
- pencils and note paper for everyone
- a pair of normal six-sided dice for each hunter (the Keeper won’t need dice). 

Also handy, mostly for [[the Keeper]], is a big list of names that you can use for the characters that will be part of the game (I like to use the Story Games Names Project book, but a phone book or the cast and crew list of a film work just as well). If you want to set your adventures in real places you’ll find a source of maps, such as Google Maps, will also be useful.

It’s a good idea to have drinks and snacks for everyone, too.

A mystery is one situation for [[the hunters]] to deal with—like a typical monster of the week episode on *Supernatural*, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, or *The X-Files*. Each time you sit down to play expect to get through a single mystery in about 2-4 hours. Sometimes it might stretch out longer, so that the mystery is split like a two-part episode instead. The first game will take a little longer because you have to make up your hunters at the beginning.
