Locations are significant places in the mystery. Define a location threat for any places that are likely to be important during the mystery. You can also add a location threat type when, during play, a place becomes the scene of action or significant events.

It’s important to note that the types describe the location in terms of what sort of things happen there, not the actual form of it. A diner could be a crossroads, because people meet there. Another diner could be a hellgate, because creatures from beyond are summoned in the back room. When picking a location threat type, think of what the place is emotionally, symbolically, and functionally, not literally.

There are ten location types:

- Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)
- Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)
- Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])
- Fortress (motivation: to deny entry)
- Hellgate (motivation: to create evil)
- Hub (motivation: to reveal information)
- Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)
- Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)
- Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)
- Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)

Decide on all the details your locations need:

- A name.
- A description.
- Location type and motivation.
- Optionally, a map.
- Optionally, one or more [[custom moves]].

Example Locations

Here’s two example locations to illustrate some different ways you can use location threats. As with the example [[bystanders]], this might be a little more detail than required for an average location in a mystery: this is the amount you’d need if it is a central part of a mystery or will be a recurring place.

**THE PORTAL OF DARKNESS**

Here’s a location that could be the center of a mystery (or an arc).

A huge, ancient gateway made of a circular grassy [[area]] surrounded by three enormous stones which are covered in eldritch runes.

**Location:** Hub (motivation: to reveal information).

Although the portal looks scary, it’s not dangerous in itself. Instead, the records of the site and deciphering the runes carved here can give [[the hunters]] a lot of clues about what’s going on. If the portal is eventually activated, it might change to be a *hellgate* or *lab* instead.

**HOME**

This location is someone’s home: maybe a Chosen, Mundane, or Spooky who is still living with their family. It’s safe, but also has their family to cause trouble.

**Location:** Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit).

**Custom move**: When you **make excuses to the family for something to do with monster hunting**, roll +[[Charm]].

- On a 10+, you smooth over things but you might need to [[Help Out]] with some chores in the near future.
- On a 7-9, they know you aren’t telling the whole truth. You smooth over things for now, but you’ll need to make an effort to be seen as the good kid. Also, take -1 the next time you roll this move.
- On a miss, they catch you out. You’re in big trouble!

Note that this move doesn’t need to just apply to a hunter who lives here. Sometimes the other hunters might need to make excuses to the family, too!
