Before you begin playing, spend some time thinking about the style you want to bring to the game. Consider the monster hunting fiction that excites you the most, and maybe watch or read some of it. Generate some ideas about how you want the world of the game to work, how it will look to [[the hunters]], and what sorts of things might be going on. You’ll find a list of my favourite monster hunting fiction on [[0000945890]] if you need some extra [[inspiration]].

The game is going to be built by you and the other players together: so at this stage consider your ideas just a sketch. Once [[the hunters]] are created and the game begins, all your sketches might get overwritten. Having something in mind gives you a skeleton of the world to begin with, but you’ll fill in the details as a group, in play.
