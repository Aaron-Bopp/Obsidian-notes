The Agency needs a team to handle all the [[Weird]] stuff regular agents don’t understand. That’s you: the Unexplained Cases Team. You check out the mysterious disappearances, the fungus [[monsters]], the alien abductions, the vampires and everything else the regular agents can’t handle.

This team concept requires a Professional. A Flake, Mundane, Expert, Spooky, and Wronged would all be good choices to fill out the team’s skill profile, while a Crooked might have some [[useful]] contacts.

[[The Professional]]’s Agency will employ the whole team. As a customisation, allow any of [[the hunters]] to take [[The Professional]]’s **[[deal with the Agency]]** move as a [[leveling up]] option (0000251869). Until then, they’re just consultants, contractors, or temps.
