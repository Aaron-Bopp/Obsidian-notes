The mystery is set in a [[small]] university town. The university needs to have an engineering school, a medical school, and a liberal arts faculty. The villain who set things in motion is an unbalanced professor, forced to resign from the university in shame and now ready to take his revenge. In true evil villain fashion he’ll demonstrate that his theories work—and so what if that proof takes the form of an army of crazed cyborg primates?

Requirements

Like “Dream Away the Time,” this mystery requires some things to be true about your game. In this case, mad science that works in parallel with [[magic]] to bind spirits, and the spirits themselves: entities from another dimension that are hostile to life.

Hook

[[The hunters]] will hear that a spate of unusual burglaries at a university has now culminated in a murder.

What makes the burglaries unusual is that they have been targeted on engineering and electronics workshops. Some artifacts have also been stolen from the Anthropology department. In all the raids, security cameras and alarms have been tampered with.

Yesterday a security guard called Chris Lamb was torn to pieces (literally) during another theft in the Engineering building.

Notes

This mystery has a fairly limited scope, with most of the events and investigation likely to take place at the university.

[[Many]] of the [[bystanders]] know or suspect the truth, but have reasons to hide their involvement. Be sure to let [[the hunters]] know when the bystander they are talking to is being evasive or obviously concealing something, and make [[the hunters]] push each character hard to get the information. These secrets are another way to see how much [[the hunters]] will do—in this case, how hard will they push these [[bystanders]]?

The strange thefts (in order of occurrence):

- Medical school labs: 18 living monkeys and 3 chimpanzees. This was initially assumed to be the Animal Freedom Militia, and so [[far]] no-one has connected it to the spate of burglaries.
- Electronics workshop storeroom. Various components stolen, no doors unlocked or unbroken—access probably via a loose ventilation grille.
- Robotics lab. Several works-in-progress and some parts stolen.
- Anthropology library. Some books on pagan cults stolen.
- Another electronics lab (this time in the computer science department). Various parts, including programmable control chips, stolen.
- Medical school labs: A number of experimental prosthetics and control computers.

Threats
Dr Lawrence Beech, Mad Scientist

![[Pasted image 20210917193613.png]]

*Monster: Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)*

The stress of academic life has led to Beech flipping out and deciding to take over the university and rule it as an absolute monarch. He’s only just moved into his hidden lab, where he’s putting the final touches on his army of robo-primates before taking over the university. Beech was not a normal, sane person even before this flipout.

Beech has no supernatural powers or abilities beyond those he uses to create his supersoldiers. If Beech upgrades himself, he gains the powers and upgrades marked “post-upgrade” below.

**Powers**:

- **Etheric-Bionic Binding Spell**: Uses intricate mathemagical programming techniques to bind bionics to a living host. An other-dimensional consciousnesses is installed into the bionics as a control interface. Has the unfortunate side effect of overwriting the host mind with the mind of the other dimensional being (which cannot comprehend this universe).
- (Post-upgrade) **Surgical robot [[hand]]** (see attacks).
- (Post-upgrade) **Minion radio net**. He can sense anything that any of his bionic [[minions]] can sense, although he must actively concentrate to do so.
- (Post-upgrade) **Etheric blast** (see attacks).
- (Post-upgrade) **Etheric awareness**. He is conscious of all living things in his immediate vicinity (within about 50m), regardless of obstacles. “Etherically active” individuals are easier for him to detect—for hunters, that’s anyone with [[Weird]] +2 or +3.

**Attacks**: (Pre-upgrade) Ineffectual slap: 0-[[harm]] [[hand]]; (Post-upgrade) Surgical robot [[hand]]: 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[slow]]; (Post-upgrade) Etheric blast: 1-[[harm]] [[close]] [[magic]] ignores-[[armour]]

**[[Armour]]**: (Pre-upgrade) None; (Post-upgrade) 2-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 7. Okay bbbb|bbb Dying [[Unstable]]: b

**Weaknesses**: **Gloating monologue:** Dr Beech cannot be defeated until [[the hunters]] have listened to him rant about his evil plans; (Post-upgrade) **Etheric-Bionic Control Interface:** If the interface is disrupted with [[magic]] or electromagnetic energy, Dr Beech will no longer be able to control the bionics and is vulnerable.

Dr Beech's Research Lab

*Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]])*

Dr Beech can currently be found here. He sends monkeys and chimps to do or obtain anything he needs outside his lab.

Beech has been absent from work for a week. That’s long enough to have been noticed by people who also know about the allegations, but most of them have assumed he’s on “gardening leave” while the whole mess is sorted out.

If [[the hunters]] visit Beech’s apartment they will find it abandoned, with some evidence of packing for a long absence.

The lab was originally a disused storage basement attached to the university’s steam tunnels. Beech has converted it into a robo-primate conversion factory. There are workbenches, operating tables, surgical robots, and a large number of robo-primates: up to 30 monkeys, and Koko and the chimps (if they are not on a mission elsewhere).

The surgical robots can be used as a weapon by Beech, but they’re tied to the operating tables, so easily avoided. They are, however, a very dangerous part of the background of any fight. If a hunter ends up on an operating table, the robotization process will begin, starting with removal of limbs.

The Steam Tunnels

*Location: Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)*

The tunnels are the only way [[the hunters]] can get to Dr Beech’s lab, and they have been rigged to repel intruders with ambushes. Beech has set up lots of motion detectors and cameras to ensure he’s warned about intruders, and he will send out monkeys to deal with anyone snooping around. The monkeys are equipped with infrared-vision camera eyes, so they can see heat signatures in the total darkness of the tunnels.

The tunnels can be confusing to navigate, so you might want to call for an **[[Act Under Pressure]]** move for [[the hunters]] to orientate themselves properly after a monkey attack.

Koko, robo Gorilla (mark 3)

![[Pasted image 20210917193646.png]]

*Minion: Assassin (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]])*

A possessed bionic silverback gorilla, Koko has been kept caged so [[far]] as he is too dangerous and [[unstable]] to be let out. Once Beech knows about [[the hunters]], or is ready to make his move, Koko will be unleashed.

Note that Koko was not stolen from the university, but acquired through other means. Most likely, Dr Beech has been in contact with animal smugglers, but this loose end is a good candidate for tying into other parts of your own game.

**Powers**:

- **Immense Strength**. Koko’s augmented gorilla limbs can overpower any human and deal with almost any [[barrier]] or weight.
- **Laser cannon**. Koko has a laser cannon mounted over his left shoulder.

**Attacks**: **Laser**: 2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[close]] [[far]]; **Tear limb from limb**: 4-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]].

**[[Armour]]**: Bionic [[Armour]] Plating: 2-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 12. bbbbbbbbbbbb

**Weakness**: **Etheric-Bionic Control Interface:** If the interface is disrupted with [[magic]] or electromagnetic energy, Koko will no longer be able to control the bionics and is vulnerable.

Clara, Virgil, and Nim: robo chimps (mark 2)

![[Pasted image 20210917193710.png]]

*Minion: Thief (motivation: to steal, and deliver to the master)*

The chimps are crazy, but smart. They like to sneak about and steal things.

**Powers**:

- **Electro-grapple**. Each chimp has one arm replaced with a mechanical grapple and line. The [[hand]] may be fired up to 30 meters and winched back in. The chimps can use this to ascend, swing around, attack, and steal things.

**Attacks**: **Electro-grapple Strike**: 2-[[harm]] [[close]] [[restraining]]; **Grapple**: 3-[[harm]] [[intimate]] [[hand]] [[restraining]] [[messy]]; **Bite**: 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]].

**[[Armour]]**: **Bionic [[Armour]] Plating**: 1-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 7. bbbbbbb Clara

bbbbbbb Virgil

bbbbbbb Nim

**Weakness**: **Etheric-Bionic Control Interface:** If the interface is disrupted with [[magic]] or electromagnetic energy, the chimp will no longer be able to control the bionics and is vulnerable.

Robo Monkeys (mark 1)

![[Pasted image 20210917193744.png]]

*Minion: Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)*

Beech has around thirty robo-monkeys of various species. The monkeys will tend to attack as in two groups of about 15 each, and the stats below are for one of these groups of 15.

**Powers**:

- **Railgun**: Each monkey is equipped with a [[small]] electromagnetic cannon, which they’ll load with [[whatever]] comes to [[hand]]—stones, rubbish, poo, etc.
- **Camera Eyes**: They can see infrared, so the robo-monkeys have excellent vision in total darkness, especially for spotting people.

**Attacks**: **Railgun:** 0-3-[[harm]] (depends on ammunition) [[close]] [[far]]; **Bite:** 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]].

**[[Armour]]**: Bionic plating: 1-[[armour]]

**[[Harm]] capacity**: Each group: 5.

Group one: bbbbb Group two: bbbbb

Each point of [[harm]] suffered by the group means 3 monkeys are out of action.

**Weakness**: **Etheric-Bionic Control Interface**: If the interface is disrupted with [[magic]] or electromagnetic energy, the monkey will no longer be able to control the bionics and is vulnerable.

University Quad

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

There’s a large quad in the center of the university campus. It’s usually filled with students. On the edges of the quad [[the hunters]] will find two cafes, the university library, and the main administration building.

University Departments

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

The various departments [[the hunters]] may be interested in are all similar: long hallways, doors with opaque numbering systems (different for each department), and an assortment of offices, classrooms, labs, and storage areas lining any particular corridor.

University Grand Hall

*Location: Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)*

The Grand Hall is almost a hundred years old, and built in an ornate gothic style. A cramped balcony looks down on the main stage and seating [[area]]. Stained glass windows illustrating academic virtues take pride of place behind the stage.

This is the hall where the graduation ceremony is held each year, and it’s at that ceremony that Beech plans to attack. He is trying to capture as [[many]] of his academic enemies as possible.

For his attack, Beech will position the monkeys and chimps on the balcony, then take the stage escorted by Koko. He will then announce his takeover in a deranged monologue, declaring that he is now “grand chancellor” of the university. The only reason he will pause will be to order the robo-primates to restrain anyone escaping or to subdue anyone resisting.

After Beech has finished his speech, the primates will begin escorting groups of staff and students through the steam tunnels to the robo-primate conversion factory.

Pauline Brooks

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)*

A security guard at the university, doomed to be maimed in the events of “day” in [[the countdown]]. Before then, Pauline can help [[the hunters]] with details of the usual routine for the security team. They’re generally more concerned with students causing minor trouble rather than any kind of serious threat.

**Attacks**: Nightstick: 1-[[harm]] [[hand]]

**[[Armour]]**: Stab-proof vest: 1-[[armour]]

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 7. bbbb|bbb

Dr Andrew Crouch, Medical School Dean

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)*

Hates Dr Beech intensely, regarding him as unbalanced and dangerous. It was Dr Crouch who finally revoked Beech’s funding and triggered the current crisis.

Does not want to reveal anything about Dr Beech because it would reflect badly on the school. He has little idea about the details and extent of Beech’s research except that [[many]] other people thought it was crazy, out-beyond-the-fringe stuff.

Dr Karen Wathey, Prostethics Researcher

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

Previous collaborator with Dr Beech, decided he was going too [[far]] and stopped helping. Also leaked details of Beech’s ethics violations to the Dean in an effort to get Beech punished.

Does not want to reveal anything about Beech because it might endanger her own career. She knows that Beech has no qualms at all about breaching ethics rules, and has begun to worry about the possibility that he has no qualms about breaking other rules either.

Dr Harvey Noble, Roboticist

*Bystander: Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)*

Noble has devoted much of his career to criticizing Dr Beech, ever since their first disagreement over who deserved the nicer office in a building that has since been demolished and rebuilt.

Noble will happily rant about the various shortcomings of Dr Beech, but his perspective is that Beech acts mainly in order to snipe at Noble. Any [[useful]] information is likely to be hidden in Noble’s general accusations of misconduct. He is aware that Beech was looking into “crazy” control systems for bionics, verging into parapsychology in some cases.

Dr Clayton Holt, Ethics Committee Chair

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Holt is in charge of the university research ethics committee and thus has access to a number of Beech’s research proposals. Most of these—especially the most recent and disturbing ones—were denied.

Holt also oversaw the ethics breach complaints against Beech and is aware that Beech was conducting hideous prosthetic experiments on animals.

The university (specifically Dean Crouch) prevailed upon the committee to keep the details of these sessions confidential due to the danger they posed to the university’s reputation. Holt is not wholly happy with that situation and can be persuaded to reveal what he knows if [[the hunters]] provide good reasons (such as clues that Beech is continuing his work illicitly).

Amy Pritchard, Student

*Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

Former student of Dr Beech. Shocked by the experiments he was conducting, Pritchard has now joined the Animal Freedom Militia.

Does not want to tell anyone about Beech and the experiments because she’s ashamed of her own involvement in them. She knows a great deal about Beech’s theories of etheric-bionic synergy, but has no idea that he has managed to get them working in practical applications, even imperfectly.

Robin Harding, Animal Freedom Militia Liberationist

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

Harding is the head of the university’s branch of the AFM. She is a strict vegan, and a zealous protector of animals.

If questioned, she denies the AFM had anything to do with the stolen primates, but only because they have not been able to free the primates themselves. The activities of other animal liberators are fully supported by the AFM.

Harding has plenty of contacts with animal shelters and rescue groups, and would be good to have on-side if any of Beech’s primates are rescued alive and need to be rehabilitated.

Crazy Cats Club

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

A bar and punk/alternative music venue, this is also the *de facto* headquarters of the Animal Freedom Militia. The bar is cramped and noisy, the walls covered with [[messy]] murals and graffiti.

If [[the hunters]] come here undercover as cops or other authority figures, the patrons will tend to be hostile.

Amy and Robin can be found here most evenings, and if not then someone will know where they are.

Claire Guimaras, Local police chief

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to reveal information)*

Concerned mainly with the weirdness of the crime, Guimaras has no particular leads when [[the hunters]] first arrive. It’s clearly linked to the other recent thefts at the university, but the extreme violence of the attack on the security guard has left her puzzled.

Later in the adventure, forensic technicians will report that samples from the scene reveal that at least two chimpanzees were involved. This fact does not help Guimaras in any meaningful way.

If [[the hunters]] can give her some leads or any kind of explanation about what is really going on, she’ll be grateful.

Other [[Bystanders]]

Use these templates as starting points for any other people [[the hunters]] talk to.
