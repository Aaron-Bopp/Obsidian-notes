Each mystery has a *countdown*: this is the sequence of terrible things that will happen if [[the hunters]] don’t stop the monster. [[The countdown]] will be your guide to what will be going on off-screen as [[the hunters]] investigate.

To create [[the countdown]], think about what would happen if [[the hunters]] never came to help.

- Who would be attacked?
- Who would die?
- What is the monster’s ultimate plan?

Once you have an idea, divide it into six events in [[the order]] they will occur. Then allocate them to the steps in [[the countdown]]. Countdowns always have the following six steps:

- Day.
- Shadows.
- Dusk.
- Sunset.
- Nightfall.
- Midnight.

The names of each step are intended to give a sense of things getting worse. They are metaphorical: the “sunset” step of a countdown doesn’t have to happen at sunset; the steps don’t have to happen on the same day.

As [[the countdown]] is what would happen if [[the hunters]] didn’t interfere, it normally won’t play out how you wrote it. But even when the monster’s plan has been derailed, it will still be trying to achieve its goals and [[the countdown]] is [[useful]] as a guide (or something to adapt) to determine what happens next.

*For example:*

*Here’s [[the countdown]] for our haunted house story.*

- **Day:** *Marie traps the Hadleys in the house.*
- **Shadows:** *Marie begins scaring them, hoping to push them towards the cellar by fear.*
- **Dusk:** *Mark is killed while trying to get a window open.*
- **Sunset:** *Marie tries to get Andi and the kids to dig up her remains, but they don’t understand and she kills them all in a rage.*
- **Nightfall:** *In another year, Marie kills four more people who squat in the house overnight.*
- **Midnight:** *Five years later, another family [[moves]] in and Marie kills them.*

*This is all the stuff that will happen if [[the hunters]] never came. I expect that with [[the hunters]] present, they’ll be trapped in the house as well as (or instead of) the Hadleys. After that, I’m not sure how it will go. We’ll find out when we play.*
