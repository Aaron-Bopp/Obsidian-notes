Each mystery has a *countdown*: this is the sequence of terrible things that will happen if the hunters don’t stop the monster. The countdown will be your guide to what will be going on off-screen as the hunters investigate.

To create the countdown, think about what would happen if the hunters never came to help.

- Who would be attacked?
- Who would die?
- What is the monster’s ultimate plan?

Once you have an idea, divide it into six events in the order they will occur. Then allocate them to the steps in the countdown. Countdowns always have the following six steps:

- Day.
- Shadows.
- Dusk.
- Sunset.
- Nightfall.
- Midnight.

The names of each step are intended to give a sense of things getting worse. They are metaphorical: the “sunset” step of a countdown doesn’t have to happen at sunset; the steps don’t have to happen on the same day.

As the countdown is what would happen if the hunters didn’t interfere, it normally won’t play out how you wrote it. But even when the monster’s plan has been derailed, it will still be trying to achieve its goals and the countdown is useful as a guide (or something to adapt) to determine what happens next.

*For example:*

*Here’s the countdown for our haunted house story.*

- **Day:** *Marie traps the Hadleys in the house.*
- **Shadows:** *Marie begins scaring them, hoping to push them towards the cellar by fear.*
- **Dusk:** *Mark is killed while trying to get a window open.*
- **Sunset:** *Marie tries to get Andi and the kids to dig up her remains, but they don’t understand and she kills them all in a rage.*
- **Nightfall:** *In another year, Marie kills four more people who squat in the house overnight.*
- **Midnight:** *Five years later, another family moves in and Marie kills them.*

*This is all the stuff that will happen if the hunters never came. I expect that with the hunters present, they’ll be trapped in the house as well as (or instead of) the Hadleys. After that, I’m not sure how it will go. We’ll find out when we play.*
