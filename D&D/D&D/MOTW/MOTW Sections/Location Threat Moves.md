**USING LOCATION THREATS**

Locations normally don’t have intentions in the way that monsters, minions and bystanders do. Instead they stand in for things that go wrong around the hunters, due to hazards in the environment. For example, in a **maze**, an exit door could get jammed, or the GPS in the hunters’ car might start glitching out.

Location threat moves give you ways to move the mystery along, or put obstacles in the way of the hunters. They’re useful to pace the mystery as it plays out—to slow the progress down, or speed it up. The moves also work well when there’s action, to keep things exciting.
