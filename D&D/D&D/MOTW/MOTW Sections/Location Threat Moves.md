**USING LOCATION THREATS**

[[Locations]] normally don’t have intentions in the way that [[monsters]], [[minions]] and [[bystanders]] do. Instead they stand in for things that go wrong around [[the hunters]], due to hazards in the environment. For example, in a **maze**, an exit door could get jammed, or the GPS in [[the hunters]]’ car might start glitching out.

Location [[threat moves]] give you ways to move the mystery along, or put obstacles in the way of [[the hunters]]. They’re [[useful]] to pace the mystery as it plays out—to [[slow]] the progress down, or speed it up. The [[moves]] also work well when there’s action, to keep things exciting.
