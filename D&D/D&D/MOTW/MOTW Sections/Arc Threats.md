Arc threats are created (and work) in exactly the same way as mystery threats, except there doesn’t need to be a monster. [[Arcs]] dealing with human organisations (an Agency or Sect, for example) might be made up of only [[bystanders]] and [[locations]].

*For example:*

*Our werewolf leader was already written up as a threat in that original mystery, so we’ll add her first.*

*Nina Keenan. Monster: Queen (motivation: to possess and control). I’ll omit her werewolf powers and weaknesses here, but they will be the same as when she appeared previously (and in keeping with the established rules for werewolves).*

*[[The Wronged]] is hunting a werewolf too. His name is George Tovey, but [[The Wronged]] just calls him “the black werewolf.” Let’s put that one here too. This threat was established by the player when she made [[The Wronged]], but it is currently unallocated to any mystery or arc. I’ll add him to this arc now.*

*“The Black Werewolf” aka George Tovey. Monster: Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify).*

*My idea is that Nina is in charge of this new pack, and she’s brought in George to be her top enforcer.*

*That’s enough key werewolves for this pack, but we’ll add two minion threats for the rest of the pack. The first I’m calling “werewolf brutes.” They’re my generic werewolves to throw in at will. I’ll also have a few who are going to be tougher, and sent after [[the hunters]]. They’ll be “werewolf assassins.” Both groups are named after their minion type.*

*Werewolf brutes (there are a dozen or so). Minion: Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack).*

*Three werewolf assassins. Minion: Assassin (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]]).*

*Nina’s new werewolf pack will have taken a town (let’s call it “New Hampstead”) as their new territory, and will be beginning to take over the whole area. I’ll define that as a location, because sooner or later [[the hunters]] will go there.*

*New Hampstead and surrounds. Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]]).*

*Given that the most likely thing that will happen to [[the hunters]] when they visit is a succession of werewolf attacks, that type seems very appropriate.*

*I don’t think the arc needs any [[more threats]] at this stage. Maybe some of the people in New Hampstead will be [[bystanders]] in this arc later on, but this is enough to start with. The initial ideas have given me plenty to use when writing up mysteries: werewolf attacks, people asking around about [[the hunters]], rumours of werewolf activity, and so on.*
