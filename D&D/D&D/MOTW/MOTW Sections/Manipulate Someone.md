This move is used when you want someone to do something for you and they don’t want to do it. To get them to do what you’re asking you’ll need a good reason. What counts as a good reason depends on what you are asking for and your relationship with them.

For friends and allies, you might just need to ask. For witnesses to a monster attack, you could tell them you are with the police, or just offer them some cash for answering your questions.

Once you have given them a reason, **tell them what you want them to do** and roll +Charm.

For a normal person:

- If you get 10+, then they’ll do it for the reason you gave them. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you the minimum it would take for them to do it (or if there’s no way they’d do it).
- On a 7-9, they’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.
- On a miss, your approach is completely wrong: you offend or anger the target.

For another hunter:

- On a 10+, if they do what you ask they mark experience and get +1 [[forward]].
- On a 7-9, they mark experience if they do what you ask.
- On a miss, it’s up to that hunter to decide how badly you offend or annoy them. They mark experience if they decide *not* to do what you asked.

**MANIPULATING [[MONSTERS]]**

**Manipulate someone** does not normally work on [[monsters]], even if they can reason and talk. You can try and make a deal with one if you really want, but you don’t get to roll to ensure it keeps its side of the bargain. You just have to hope it’s an honourable fiend. Good luck with that.

If you take [[the Monstrous]] move **dark negotiator** (or any other move that specifically allows it) then you are allowed to manipulate [[monsters]], at least if they can reason and talk. Of course, a monster probably needs a different sort of reason than normal people—quite possibly something you really won’t want to do.

[[Minions]] may or may not be susceptible to manipulation. It may be possible to manipulate [[minions]] who are human, or almost human; those that are incapable of understanding or reason cannot be manipulated.

Here’s the most important thing to remember about the **manipulate someone** move: the hunter needs to offer something that makes the target willing to do what the hunter asks.

This doesn’t mean it should be hard. It can be enough for a hunter to pretend to be a police officer, or say “I’ll look after you,” or promise to [[help out]] later.

But don’t let it be too easy either. If a hunter is asking a bystander to be bait in a monster trap, there may be nothing the hunter can offer that will convince them to do it. Use the target’s motivation to help determine what might be enough for them. Use your agenda of making the world seem real and the rule to [[always say]] what honesty demands to assess whether the target would be willing to do what the hunter is asking for.

When a hunter tries to manipulate another hunter, things work differently. In this case, the incentive is the experience check and bonus that will be available to the target if the move succeeds. The target hunter gets to choose whether that incentive, along with whatever they were offered in the game, is enough to convince them do what is asked.

Misses on this move naturally lead to offending the target, or the hunter coming across as obtuse or annoying. When the move is used on the other hunters, one of these results will probably happen naturally. For misses with [[bystanders]], the target could see through a disguise, or refuse to believe a critical lie (or truth!). Look at the threat type for the character (or pick one for them right now) and their motivation will give you an idea how they are going to react.

If the hunter promises something as part of manipulating someone, but then fails to do what they promised, you can use that in the game. If they ever meet that person again, this failure is not going to be forgotten! That means that you can set a new mystery in the same place, and [[the hunters]] will need to deal with [[bystanders]] who have no reason to trust them, or who may even want revenge.

**MANIPULATING [[MONSTERS]]**

By default [[the hunters]] can’t manipulate [[monsters]]. Even if a monster can talk and reason, it cannot be trusted to keep its word. You should certainly allow [[the hunters]] to make a deal with a monster, if they try to, but they do not get to roll **manipulate someone** and they certainly will not get a guarantee that the monster will [[hold]] up its end of the bargain. From the monster’s point of view, hunters wanting to make a deal are probably in a weak position so this is a great opportunity to take advantage of them.

The only exception is when a hunter move explicitly allows it (such as [[the Monstrous]] move **dark negotiator**). If a hunter has a move allowing this, then **manipulate** works as normal (although what a monster wants in return could be quite unpleasant).

[[Minions]] may or may not be vulnerable to manipulation. If the minion is a normal human working for a monster, then hunters can manipulate them fine. The other extreme are [[minions]] who can’t understand speech and may not be capable of making deals, such as brain-eating zombies or a malevolent fungus. Make decisions for the in-between cases as they come up, and remember that the minion might want something nasty in return for doing what the hunter asks.
