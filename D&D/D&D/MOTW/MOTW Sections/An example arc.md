*An example arc:*

*Let’s say that there was a particularly annoying werewolf pack leader who eluded [[the hunters]]. She seems like a good choice to start an arc around (especially as the team has a Wronged who is hunting werewolves).*

*[[The hunters]] killed most of the werewolf pack, so the leader will definitely [[hold]] a grudge, and she was pretty smart in her tactics, so the idea of her starting a crusade against [[the hunters]] makes perfect sense.*

# [[Arc Threats]]

*Our werewolf leader was already written up as a threat in that original mystery, so we’ll add her first.*

*Nina Keenan. Monster: Queen (motivation: to possess and control). I’ll omit her werewolf powers and weaknesses here, but they will be the same as when she appeared previously (and in keeping with the established rules for werewolves).*

*[[The Wronged]] is hunting a werewolf too. His name is George Tovey, but [[The Wronged]] just calls him “the black werewolf.” Let’s put that one here too. This threat was established by the player when she made [[The Wronged]], but it is currently unallocated to any mystery or arc. I’ll add him to this arc now.*

*“The Black Werewolf” aka George Tovey. Monster: Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify).*

*My idea is that Nina is in charge of this new pack, and she’s brought in George to be her top enforcer.*

*That’s enough key werewolves for this pack, but we’ll add two minion threats for the rest of the pack. The first I’m calling “werewolf brutes.” They’re my generic werewolves to throw in at will. I’ll also have a few who are going to be tougher, and sent after [[the hunters]]. They’ll be “werewolf assassins.” Both groups are named after their minion type.*

*Werewolf brutes (there are a dozen or so). Minion: Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack).*

*Three werewolf assassins. Minion: Assassin (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]]).*

*Nina’s new werewolf pack will have taken a town (let’s call it “New Hampstead”) as their new territory, and will be beginning to take over the whole area. I’ll define that as a location, because sooner or later [[the hunters]] will go there.*

*New Hampstead and surrounds. Location: Den (motivation: to harbour [[monsters]]).*

*Given that the most likely thing that will happen to [[the hunters]] when they visit is a succession of werewolf attacks, that type seems very appropriate.*

*I don’t think the arc needs any [[more threats]] at this stage. Maybe some of the people in New Hampstead will be [[bystanders]] in this arc later on, but this is enough to start with. The initial ideas have given me plenty to use when writing up mysteries: werewolf attacks, people asking around about [[the hunters]], rumours of werewolf activity, and so on.*

# [[Arc Countdowns]]

*For example:*

*The arc countdown for our werewolf revenge arc is going to center on Nina and George getting ready to take out [[the hunters]].*

- **Day:** *Nina consolidates her [[hold]] over New Hampstead and creates a bunch of new werewolves.*
- **Shadows:** *The pack begins sending out spies to find [[the hunters]] and assassins to kill [[the hunters]]’ loved ones and support network.*
- **Dusk:** *George decides to target [[The Wronged]], by hunting down her family (aiming to turn them into werewolves, rather than “just” kill them).*
- **Sunset:** *The pack makes a concerted assault on [[the hunters]] and takes them out.*
- **Nightfall:** *The pack kills any other monster hunters who are active in the region, and begins turning people in positions of authority.*
- **Midnight:** *Nina rules the whole region through the pack.*

Note that this countdown needs to be created a little differently than usual. Because the arc was triggered by [[the hunters]]’ actions, it’s not what would happen if they never got involved. They’re already involved! So this one is what will happen if [[the hunters]] don’t find out about Nina and the werewolves, or if [[the hunters]] do not stop Nina’s plan in time.
