You are all members of an ancient order of monster slayers.

You’ll need an Initiate. Everyone else makes up the teaThe Initiate commands: [[The Spooky]], Expert, Mundane, Flake, Crooked, or Chosen all work well here.

Everyone is a member of the Order, but initially onlThe Initiate will have to deal with your superiors. As a customisation, anyone can takThe Initiate move for **when you are in good standing with the Sect** as a [[leveling up]] option (0000171217).

Road-tripping Hunter Family

Your family’s trade is hunting [[monsters]]. The nomadic life, drifting into town just long enough to find and slay [[whatever]] is causing trouble... well, it suits some of you just fine. Others, not so much.

This team concept suits [[The Wronged]], Spooky, Divine, Expert, Flake, and Chosen best. A Monstrous could fit in too, but not comfortably. All the others except [[The Professional]] could round out the team. If there’s an Initiate, maybe the Sect is comprised of certain bloodlines, so everyone in the family is a member.

You are all family, or as good as family.

Oh, and make sure you have a [[Cool]] car. Or a sensible anonymous car, if that’s your thing. If none of [[the hunters]] has a vehicle, you can decide the team gets one as a customisation.
