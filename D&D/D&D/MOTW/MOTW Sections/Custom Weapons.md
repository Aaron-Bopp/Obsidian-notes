If your hunter (or your foes) get a new weapon that needs tags, you can define your own. Think about the way the weapon is used and what effects it will have, then write down tags in accordance with that.

Every weapon must have a harm and range tag. There’s no upper limit on the harm rating, but 4 or more is unusually destructive. Use the existing weapons in the hunter playbooks and the following table as a guide. Permitted range tags are intimate, hand, close, and far. Other tags are optional.

- If it’s hardly more dangerous than a punch, 0-harm hand.
- If it’s sharp or heavy, 1-harm hand.
- If it’s dangerous, 2-harm hand heavy.
- If it’s a weapon designed to kill, 3-harm.
- If it’s overkill for a person, 4-harm.
- If you can throw it, add +close.

For example, a hunter decides they want a super-soaker type water gun for a monster that has “water” as a weakness. It needs a “liquid” tag (not “water,” because you could fill it with something else too), so write it: water gun (0-harm close liquid).
