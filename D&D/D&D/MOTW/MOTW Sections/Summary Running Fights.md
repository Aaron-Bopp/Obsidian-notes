- Think about what’s at stake.
- Work out how the fight starts based on what’s happening in the game.
- Describe the location and pick a type for it, then use those details and threat moves. Consider what makes this place unusual.
- Make maps.
- Use the combatants’ weapon and attack tags.
- Use moves creatively.
- Most times, do the obvious thing. Usually the first thing you think of is perfectly appropriate.
- Balance spotlight time between the hunters.
- Don’t drag things out. You can zoom out on the action when it’s not so important, or not so interesting.
- Use soft moves and give the hunters a chance to react.
- Try to hurt the hunters: they can handle it.
