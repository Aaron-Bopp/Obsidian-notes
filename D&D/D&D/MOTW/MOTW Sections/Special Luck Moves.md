Some of the hunter playbooks get a special move when they spend [[Luck]]. This optional section provides special [[moves]] for all the [[hunter types]]. 

- **The Action Scientist Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], some gadget or machine near you will do something [[Weird]], malfunction, break down, or explode. 
- **[[The Chosen]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], something from your Fate will come up in play. 
- **[[The Crooked]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], someone from your past will reappear in your life to collect on a debt or obligation. 
- **[[The Divine]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you get word your Mission requires something difficult that must be done. By you. Urgently. 
- **[[The Expert]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you’ll discover something happening now is related to something you were involved in years ago. Maybe it’s directly due to your actions, or maybe someone else is dabbling in the same [[area]]. 
- **[[The Exile]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you’ll find something from your original life. Maybe something good, maybe something bad. 
- **[[The Flake]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], pick an aspect of the current situation. [[The Keeper]] will tell you what other conspiracies that aspect is connected to. If that aspect wasn’t part of another conspiracy, it is now. 
- **[[The Gumshoe]] Special**: When you use a point of [[Luck]] your next regular case will actually be a mystery for your hunter group, not a regular case at all (and the monster will focus its attention on you!) 
- **[[The Hard Case]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], an enemy from your past comes back into your life. They aren’t happy to see you. 
- **[[The Hex]] Special**: When you spend [[Luck]], until the rest of the mystery, backlash on your spells will be extra nasty. 
- **[[The Initiate]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], something goes wrong for your Sect: an ill-advised project or a disastrous operation. It might be your fault; it could be due to the Sect’s bad traditions. 
- **[[The Meddling Kid]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you will see something you weren’t supposed to see. It might help you with your current mystery or it might just scare you. 
- **[[The Monstrous]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], your monster side gains power. Your Curse may temporarily become stronger, or another disadvantage of your Breed may manifest. 
- **[[The Mundane]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you’ll find something [[Weird]]. Maybe even [[useful]], but mostly just [[Weird]]. 
- **[[The Pararomantic]] Special**: When you spend a point of [[Luck]], also mark off one of your relationship status boxes. [[The Keeper]] will bring **The fate of your love** into play. 
- **[[The Professional]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], your next mission from the Agency comes with lots of Red Tape. Lots. 
- **[[The Searcher]] Special**: When you spend a point of [[Luck]], your [[First Encounter]] comes up in play. It could be a flashback, new occurrence, or related event. 
- **[[The Snoop]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you’re going to suffer some technical difficulties. Breakdowns, communication problems, [[Weird]] noises in the recordings. Anything goes. 
- **[[The Spell-Slinger]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], the official council of wizards is going to poke their nose into your business. There is always some rule, tradition, or law you have bent or broken. 
- **[[The Spooky]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], your Dark Side’s needs will grow nastier. 
- **[[The Summoned]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], another Sign of the Apocalypse will come to pass. When you have spent all your [[luck]], the Apocalypse begins. 
- **[[The Wronged]] Special**: When you spend a [[Luck]], you find a dangerous lead on your prey. Maybe they know you’re coming or they set up the lead in order to lure you in.
