[[The countdown]] gives you a way to define the scope of a mystery.

A confined, personal mystery has each event about the same person, or their immediate family and surroundings.

An epic mystery has the effects of each step affecting a wider [[area]]. [[The countdown]] for an epic mystery might start with a hook that focuses on a home, neighbourhood or town while its final steps affect the whole world (or the whole universe).

To make the mystery more intense, a good trick is to take your finished countdown, move the “midnight” event to “dusk” or “sunset.” Work out what happens next to fill up the remaining steps again.
