- Choose hunter playbooks and come up with a team concept.
- Create your hunter while everyone else creates theirs.
- Go around the group: each of you introduces your hunter to the others
- Go around the group again: each of you picks a history option for every other hunter on the team.
- Keeping your selected history options in mind, tidy up the team concept and work out your backstory.
- Go on to the things you do every game (see below)
- At the end of the first session, review your hunter’s playbook and decide if any of the options you picked didn’t match your vision of what the character would be like. If you need to make some changes, go ahead and do it.
