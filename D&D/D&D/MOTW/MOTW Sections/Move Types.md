[[Moves]] come in three main types:

- A roll, usually adding a rating. Define what happens on a good success (10+), partial success (7-9) and a miss (6-). Note that you could specify a different number to add, not just a rating: [[harm]] suffered, number of people sacrificed to cast a spell, etc.
- A bonus or penalty for some circumstance.
- A special effect that applies in certain circumstances.

Use the [[moves]] I’ve provided throughout this book as [[examples]] and guidelines. All the character [[moves]], the basic [[moves]], and the example [[moves]] in the Mysteries and [[Arcs]] section have been created to fit this pattern.

[[Custom moves]] might be much more limited than other [[moves]], or they might be vastly more powerful. That’s fine, as long as they are just what is needed for that part of your game.
