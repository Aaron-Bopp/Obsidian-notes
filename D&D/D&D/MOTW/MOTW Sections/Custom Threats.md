If there’s a need for a threat type that doesn’t quite fit into the ones that are already defined, just add it. All that’s needed are a name, a motivation, and any [[custom moves]] it can make.

Think about whether it is a monster, minion, bystander, or location. If it doesn’t fit into any of those, you can create a new threat type with its own list of [[Special Luck Moves]].

Example Custom Threat: An Evil Cult

This custom threat represents an evil cult infesting a [[small]] town. It’s a minion threat.

*They’re Everywhere!* (motivation: make people scared to speak out).

This threat has this custom move.

When a hunter **asks locals about something [[Weird]]**, roll +[[Sharp]].

On a 10+, the hunter works out:

- if they are talking to a member of the cult, this person is concealing something important.
- if they are talking to a normal person, this person is too scared to reveal anything.

On a 7-9, the hunter knows something isn’t right, but not exactly what.

On a miss, the cult gets told that this hunter is asking questions about them (regardless of whether that was the subject or not).
