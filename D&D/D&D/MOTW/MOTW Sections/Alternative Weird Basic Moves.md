# Alternative Weird Basic Moves

*By Michael Sands*

These optional rules allow your hunters to have different Weird basic [[moves]], instead of everyone having access to **[[use magic]]**. These rules are intended for games that place more emphasis on [[weird science]] and paranormal powers than *Monster of the Week*’s default occultism and magic.

If you use this rule, **[[use magic]]** is no longer a basic move for all hunters. Instead, all hunters pick a weirdness move from **how are you weird?** (See below.)

Any hunter [[playbook moves]] that change how you would normally **[[use magic]]** now apply to the new move (if it doesn’t directly apply, come up with an appropriate adjustment with the agreement of your group— perhaps that hunter can now **[[use magic]]** with the modifications applied).

# Casting Spells Without Use Magic

Hunters who do not have **[[use magic]]** as their Weirdness move must treat any spell as [[big magic]]. [[The Keeper]] may wish to pick requirements towards the lighter end of the spectrum if the spell’s effects will be at the level of **[[use magic]]**.

**[[Big magic]]** still works the same for everyone, but you may adjust the requirements so they have a more ‘[[weird science]]’ style when appropriate.

# Your Mythology

As with all [[custom moves]], you should consider how this works with your world’s mythology. Many of these weirdness [[moves]] make certain things true in your world.

For instance, if a hunter chooses **[[past lives]]** then it becomes true that some people are reincarnated and can remember their previous lives. If someone takes **[[illuminated]]**, there must be some Secret Masters out there with some plan for the world (or something pretending to be that).

Perhaps some of these options aren’t appropriate. Some of these new [[moves]] might be rare. Consider that along with your concept as you pick which one is right for your hunter. Check that the whole group is on board with your choice.

# The New Weird Moves

- [[Empath]] 
- [[Illuminated]] 
- [[No Limits]] 
- [[Past Lives]] 
- [[Sensitive]] 
- [[Trust Your Gut]] 
- [[Telekinesis]] 
- [[Weird Science]]

If none of these weirdness [[moves]] seem appropriate, use:

- **[[Trust your gut]]** or **[[no limits]]** for a relatively mundane hunter.
- **[[Weird science]]** for a curious, scientific minded hunter.
- **[[Sensitive]]** or **[[empath]]** for those with psychic potential.
- **[[Use magic]]** for anyone else.

These are the weirdness [[moves]] that have the smallest implications for your game’s mythology.
