From [[Hunter Creation]]

When you’ve all reached the “Introductions” section, you’ll take turns introducing your hunter to the others. Describe how your hunter looks, and the main things the team would know about you. What are you good at? What drives you? What personality traits stand out? [[The Keeper]] or the other hunters might have some questions for you too. Answer them as appropriate.

[[History]]

Once everyone’s ready to introduce themselves, facilitate taking turns to introduce hunters. The most important things each player should describe are their hunter’s name, playbook and looks, though they can add more if they want.

You should ask a few questions of each player to tease out more details that you and the others might need to know, especially about things that will have a big impact on the game (the Chosen’s destiny, [[The Professional]]’s agency, [[The Wronged]]’s loss, etc). This is also a good time to ask what each hunter can do, so that everyone can see how the team works together.
