If you want to get something that you could just buy, just buy it.

You can also get new [[gear]] when you take certain [[improvements]].

If you want something that you couldn’t just buy (like a flamethrower, or a magical artifact), or something you don’t have the resources to get, then you need to do something special (like call in a favour, or steal it). Tell [[the Keeper]] what you’re doing, and play through the acquisition attempt to see how well it works.

The same thing can apply if you want an ally, a team under your command, or something else hard to arrange (like an Expert’s [[haven]]).

If you do everything necessary to get the new [[gear]], well, then you get it (even without using an improvement or anything like that).
