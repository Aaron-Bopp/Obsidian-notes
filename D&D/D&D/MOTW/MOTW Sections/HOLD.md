**HOLD**

When you get a hold, you’ll get a number of points. Each point can be spent one-for-one to get a specific effect. The move will list the effects you can spend your hold on.

*For example, you are interviewing the witnesses to a monster attack and you make an* ***[[Investigate A Mystery]]*** *roll. Your result gives you 3 hold. You can spend your hold to ask [[the Keeper]] questions from the list in the* ***[[Investigate A Mystery]]*** *move.*

*You ask a witness, “Did you see where the attacker went?” and spend one hold. (“Where did it go?” is one of the questions.)*

*[[The Keeper]] says (as Mrs Henderson, the witness), “It scurried over there, and pulled up that grating and went into the sewers.”*

*As the conversation with the witnesses continues, you spend the next hold to ask [[the Keeper]] about the monster’s powers. “Hey, from all the things they’ve told me, can I work out any powers?” (“What can it do?” is another question.)*

*[[The Keeper]] replies, “The witness descriptions don’t agree at all. It must be able to change shape or maybe change memories.”*

*Later the last hold goes to ask [[the Keeper]] about whether a witness is hiding something. That exhausts your hold, so you don’t get any more questions for now.*
