For your monster, it’s best to start with something from folklore or urban legend (there’s plenty of online sources for this: I use [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) as my starting point). Working from established folklore means everyone will have a general idea about what the monster is capable of (once they work out what it is).

If you don’t want to take a creature from folklore or urban legend as the basis of your mystery, here are some other good sources:

- Use a monster from another source (perhaps a film, novel, TV show, or comic). I recommend changing things around a little, so that any of your players familiar with the source won’t recognise it immediately.
- Use a basic idea from folklore or urban legend, but change it in major ways.
- Come up with a cosmological reason for the monsters in your game, and use that to decide how they consistently appear and act. A game in which monsters are dangerous manifestations of features in the natural world (cities, forests, oceans, etc) will have a very different style to one where every monster is an inscrutable intrusion from outside our universe.
- Create your own creature, perhaps based on your game’s existing mythology.
- Use a monster breed [[the hunters]] have encountered before, but vary its abilities or motivation.
- Use a monster breed [[the hunters]] have encountered before, but showing a different aspect of it (e.g. maybe the sewer troll they met before was a hermit, and most sewer trolls live in family groups).

Pick a type based on the creature’s motivation rather than its abilities. Not every blood-drinking vampire is a devourer, for example; it might be a breeder, because its real goal is to create an army of vampire [[minions]].

Here are the twelve monster types again:

- Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)
- Breeder (motivation: to give birth to, bring forth, or create evil)
- Collector (motivation: to steal specific sorts of things)
- Destroyer (motivation: to bring about the end of the world)
- Devourer (motivation: to consume people)
- Executioner (motivation: to punish the guilty)
- Parasite (motivation: to infest, control and devour)
- Queen (motivation: to possess and control)
- Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)
- Tempter (motivation: to tempt people into evil deeds)
- Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify)
- Trickster (motivation: to create chaos)

Decide on all the remaining elements that you’ll need: its powers, attacks, [[armour]], [[harm]] capacity, and weakness(es):

- Pick the type for the motivation this monster needs.
- Note down all the supernatural powers that it has.
- Define weaknesses.
- Define its attacks: how much [[harm]] does it do (usually 3-5)? What range? Are any other tags required?
- How much [[armour]] does it have?
- How much [[harm]] can it suffer before it dies (usually 8-12)?
- Optionally, [[custom moves]] for the monster’s powers.

When your hunters are experienced and capable, you can make the monsters tougher than those guidelines. For attacks, the normal range is 3- to 5-[[harm]], but go higher if a monster especially dangerous. An attack doing 8-[[harm]] or more is instant death (hunters have ways to survive such nasty attacks, of course: spending [[Luck]], or another hunter **protecting** them).

If you [[haven]]’t already worked out what it’s trying to achieve, give that some thought now. You need to know what its plan is, even if that plan is just “eat a lot of people.” If your initial idea doesn’t suggest a plan, look at the type you have given it. The motivation should suggest a certain sort of goal. Think about that, and then work out (given what you’ve already thought of) what is the *worst* thing that monster could be planning here? The plan could also fulfill the next stage in one of your [[arcs]], or be a new twist on something that happened in a previous mystery.

Example Monsters

Here are some [[examples]] to illustrate a variety of different monsters. Note that I’ve given each one a monster type that fits [[Building Arcs]] of the creature, but if you use it in a mystery you should consider whether it fits the monster’s role for that adventure, and change the type if you find a better match.

**A CLASSIC VAMPIRE**

A vampire based on the novel *Dracula.*

**Monster:** Queen (motivation: to possess and control).

**Powers**:

- [[Immortal]].
- Mesmerism: When **it commands you**, roll +[[Cool]]. On a 10+, you can choose whether to do it or not. If you do, mark experience and take +1 [[forward]]. On a 7-9, you can choose whether you do it or not. If you do, mark experience. If you don’t, take +1 the next time he tries to mesmerise you. On a miss, you do what it asks.
- Transform into wolf, bat, or shadow.
- Extremely strong.
- Can climb any wall.
- Incredibly stealthy.
- Vampiric bite: victims bitten three times become vampires themselves.
- Master vampire: he controls all the vampires he has created.
- Plague bringer: Disease and vermin thrive when a vampire is nearby.

**Attacks**: Punch/throw: 4-[[harm]] [[hand]]; Bite: 3-[[harm]] [[intimate]] vampiric.

**[[Armour]]**: Physical toughness: 1-[[armour]].

**Weaknesses**: Must subsist on human blood. Must sleep in the soil of his homeland. A wooden stake through the heart. Decapitation.

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 9 [[harm]].

**A MONSTROSITY FROM BEYOND**

This is an alien being. It has no name. It looks like a collection of moving shapes or roiling bubbles and is an oily black shimmery colour.

**Monster:** Collector (motivation: to steal specific sorts of things).

**Powers:**

- **Devour Memory**: If the creature succeeds with a “devour memory” attack (see below) it extrudes a tentacle into the victim’s head. The victim takes 3-[[harm]] [[ignore-armour]] and loses one memory of [[the Keeper]]’s choice. It doesn’t much care if the victim is human or not, so it will be happy eating memories from anything that has them.
- **Phasing**: The creature is not exactly in our dimension, so it can squeeze itself through solid objects. Note that when it lashes people with its tendrils in defense, they will in fact lash *through* the target (that’s why it has [[ignore-armour]]).

**Attacks:** Devour memory: 3-[[harm]] ignore [[armour]] 1-memory; Tendril lash: 4-[[harm]] [[close]] [[ignore-armour]] phasing.

**[[Armour]]:** Its semi-physical body counts as 2-[[armour]].

**Weaknesses:** Its form can be disrupted by high energy (e.g. intense heat, industrial-voltage electricity, high powered laser, etc.).

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 12 [[harm]].

**UHUL, DEMON PRINCE**

Uhul is immensely powerful, and hard to call to Earth. It’s even harder to banish. It may appear in [[many]] forms, but prefers to pass as human (with a few clues, e.g. [[small]] horns at its temples) or as a towering archetypal demon (reptilian, red, fangs, cloven hooves, wings, and tail).

**Monster:** Tempter (motivation: to tempt people into evil deeds).

**Powers:**

- **Grant Magical Power:** Uhul may gift a human with a magical ability. It only does this in exchange for something of great value, such as a soul. Hunters making this deal can take a magical move from any playbook, or something similar.
- **Change Form:** Uhul may take any human-like form it wants, but retains at least one demonic feature.
- **Summon spear:** The spear appears in Uhul’s [[hand]] at will.

**Attacks:** Fisticuffs: 2-[[harm]] [[hand]]; Demonic talons: 4-[[harm]] [[hand]]; Barbed iron spear: 5-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[close]] [[heavy]].

**[[Armour]]:** 1-[[armour]] (just generally hard to hurt).

**Weaknesses:** A specific **[[Big Magic]]** banishing ritual (requires 7 people, some rare crystals, requires **[[Use Magic]]** to banish Uhul, and takes 4 hours to cast).

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 12 [[harm]].

**A VRYKOLAKAS, A BALKAN VAMPIRE**

A vrykolakas rises each night to visit the houses of people it knew. At each house, it knocks once and calls for its friends and family. Anyone who answers the knock begins to suffer from a wasting disease, and when dead they will also rise as a vrykolakas.

These creatures have bloated bodies which their skin stretches and strains to fully cover, resulting in some areas that are flushed and others that are near-transparent. They wear the remains of [[whatever]] they were buried in, although it is partly chewed if you look closely (a consequence of their hunger before they got out of the coffin).

A vrykolakas sleeps in its den (any place that won’t be disturbed) during the day (except for Saturdays, when it must lie in its grave).

**Monster:** Breeder (motivation: to give birth to, or bring forth, evil).

**Powers:**

- **Wasting Call:** If the vrykolakas knocks (once) on your door and calls your name, and you answer, you will contract a wasting disease. You suffer 1-[[harm]] from the wasting disease every day, and you will die and rise again as a vrykolakas once it gets to 7-[[harm]]. Killing the original vrykolakas will stop the disease’s progression.
- **Night Terrors:** If the monster comes into your bedroom, it can suffocate you. If you have the vrykolakas’ wasting illness, add +2 to the [[harm]] total from the disease. If not, take 3-[[harm]] from the suffocation and life drain before you wake up.

**Attacks:** Claws: 1-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]]; Teeth: 1-[[harm]] [[intimate]] contagious (‘contagious’ gives the victim the wasting illness).

**[[Armour]]:** 2-[[armour]]

**Weaknesses:** Sleeps in its grave on Saturday; [[Fire]]; Decapitation.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 10 [[harm]].

**SPORE TROLL**

Spore trolls are fungal creatures that grow when an animal is infected with special spores. The infected animals grow supplementary fungal masses and keep getting bigger and bigger. Although strong, spore trolls aren’t very smart. They exist to defend the queen-mass, and to (eventually) explode, releasing more spores and infesting a new [[area]]. Each nest centers on a queen-mass, a horrible growth that is the nexus of all the offspring spore-trolls and other fungal workers and drones.

**Monster:** Parasite (motivation: to infest, control, and devour)

**Powers:**

- **Spore Explosion:** may infect victim: within a few days, they begin turning into another spore troll.
- **Regrowth:** if dismembered, they will regrow lost body parts in a few hours.

**Attacks:** SMASH!: 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]]; Cutting lash: 2-[[harm]] [[close]].

**[[Armour]]:** 2 [[armour]].

**Weaknesses:** Link to the fungus-queen-mass: destroying the queen-mass or severing the mental link allows the spore troll to be destroyed.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 12 [[harm]].

**A CLASSIC WEREWOLF**

A person can become a werewolf in two ways. They may be cursed (by a **[[Big Magic]]** ritual) or injured by a werewolf but not killed.

Werewolves transform into wolves on the night of the full moon each month, and run wild, attacking any human or animal prey they find.

Although a werewolf is very [[Tough]] in wolf form, it doesn’t heal any faster than normal. This means that werewolves can be identified—if wounded in wolf form—by looking for a corresponding injury in the daytime.

**Monster:** Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing).

**Powers:**

- **Transform into a wolf**: automatically, every night of the full moon.
- **Supernatural toughness**: gains extra [[harm]] capacity and [[armour]] in wolf form.

**Attacks:** Human—as normal; Wolf—Bite: 2-[[harm]] [[hand]]; Wolf—Rend: 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[messy]].

**[[Armour]]:** Human—none; Wolf—1-[[armour]].

**Weaknesses:** Silver; Wolfsbane.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** Human: 7 [[harm]]; Wolf: 18 [[harm]].

**THE DE-IDENTIFIER**

An entity from another dimension that feeds on what makes any thing distinguishable from other things. The creature appears as a hovering scaled creature with a catlike form. It [[moves]] via gentle [[Flight]], unaffected by gravity. When it takes away something’s individuality, it must touch the target and concentrate for a few seconds.

[[The hunters]] may hear about cases of people and things disappearing without a trace—in fact, they are still there, just nobody can tell them apart to recognise them. During the investigation, mention the presence of some generic people and objects—these are the current victims! If [[the hunters]] try to find out such a person’s name, or what they look like, they will not be able to (which should be a big clue about what is going on).

**Monster:** Devourer (motivation: to consume people).

**Powers:**

- **Unaffected by gravity**: It [[moves]] wherever it wishes, drifting at walking speed.

**Attacks:** Take away individuality 0-[[harm]] concentration [[hand]] (see below).

**[[Armour]]:** None.

**Weaknesses:** Identity (if [[the hunters]] somehow name it, they may kill it; this will require **[[Big Magic]]** or a very creative plan); Banishment (it may be sent back to its own dimension permanently).

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 7-[[harm]].

**[[Custom moves]]**:

**Take Away Individuality:** when it touches something, the De-Identifier takes away aspects of the entity that may be used to tell it apart from others of its kind. Entities with their individuality taken away are still whole, so [[the hunters]] can interact with such objects or talk to such people, etc. However, it will be impossible recall anything to help find that object or person again (only **[[Use Magic]]** or **[[Big Magic]]** will supersede this effect). If any hunter is successfully targetted by this custom move, take away a single thing that distinguishes them each time—their name, or an aspect of their look. When a hunter’s name and all look choices are gone, they are completely de-individualised. Recovery of these things will require **[[Big Magic]]**.

**CHUPACABRAS**

Historically, chupacabras are a fairly new urban legend originating in Puerto Rico in the 1990s. Perhaps that is just when they began visiting us?

The chupacabras is a thin, doglike, spiny creature that drinks blood. It is most known for attacking farm animals, but will happily feast on human blood if given the chance.

Individually, chupacabras are not very dangerous to a hunter team. However, they often appear en masse: a plague of the creatures afflicting a region.

**Monster:** Devourer (motivation: to consume people).

**Powers:**

- **Night Walker**: A chupacabras can disappear into the darkness, reappearing in its den. It cannot be tracked home, as it did not walk through the intervening space.

**Attacks:** Bite: 1-[[harm]] [[hand]]; Blood-suck: 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]], must bite first.

**[[Armour]]:** None.

**Weaknesses:** Sunlight; Enclosure (if you can trap it within a given [[area]], it may not night-walk away and may be killed).

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 5-[[harm]].

**GHOUL**

Inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, these ghouls are once-human cannibal gibberers-in-darkness. They have pronounced snouts, a hunched and scrambling gait, and rubbery skin. Their teeth are long and [[Sharp]], and their dirty claws grab and tear.

Ghouls are created when a person repeatedly engages in cannibalism, or simply spends too long in morbid contemplation of graveyards and sites of death. These proclivities may lead to a gradual transformation into a ghoul, especially when a nest exists nearby.

Ghouls usually seem to have a low intelligence: only interested in eating and horrifying humans around them. However, some maintain their memories and rationality (to a greater or lesser extent). These may learn [[many]] secrets of the world while traversing the ghoul tunnel networks, as well as through their dealings with the undead and other unnatural beings.

**Monster:** Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify)

**Powers:**

- **[[Immortal]]**: Ghouls do not age.
- **Tunnels Beneath**: Ghouls delve systems of tunnels beneath graveyards, first to access the flesh of the dead, but they may also travel great distances (sometimes even through time) via these passages.
- **Rubbery Flesh**: The sinews and body of a ghoul is strong and [[Tough]]. Hunters who attempt to contest with a ghoul in brute strength take -1 [[ongoing]].
- **Creature of the Night**: Ghouls can see perfectly well in the dark, but bright light dazzles them.

**Attacks:** Grabbing claws (1-[[harm]] [[hand]]), Rending teeth (1-[[harm]] [[intimate]]).

**[[Armour]]:** The rubbery flesh of a ghoul counts as 1-[[armour]].

**Weaknesses:** Sunlight.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 8 [[harm]].

[[Minions]]
