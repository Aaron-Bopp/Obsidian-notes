The ideal number of people to play *Monster of the Week* is three or four hunter players and a Keeper. Of course you can’t always arrange exactly that [[many]] people to play.

If you only have one or two hunters in a game, it’s going to be more focused on those hunters. Let them talk more, and make an extra effort to draw in elements that the players come up with for their hunter’s stories, weaving them into your mysteries and [[arcs]].

If you have more than four hunters, you’ll find [[hunter creation]] takes longer: if you want, you can save some time by having each player only pick [[history]] for some of the group—such as for every second hunter going around the table. Connections with other hunters can develop in play.

You may also find that spotlight time is harder to juggle with such a large group. You can suggest the team splits up to cover the mystery, allowing you to switch back and forth between the different groups as the mystery unfolds. You can encourage the other players to share the spotlight and to be fans of the other hunters.

With large groups, you will also find that each hunter makes fewer move rolls (and so will get a little fewer experience marks), and that combat can become either a cake-walk or overly drawn out. Some of the techniques for keeping [[fights]] interesting will help in these situations (see 0000669367).
