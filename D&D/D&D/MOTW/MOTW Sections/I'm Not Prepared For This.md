[[The hunters]] will do things you didn’t expect. They might check out somewhere you didn’t define, or talk to someone you hadn’t thought about.

If this happens, just make a note of the person or place, give them a name, and quickly pick a threat type for them. That’s all you need to do, after which you can treat that person or place the same as any of your prepared threats.

You can even do this with monster and minion threats, if it makes sense, although then you also need to pick powers, weaknesses, attacks, [[armour]], and [[harm]] capacity. It’s less common for an unexpected monster to be called for, but you can never be sure. [[The hunters]] might summon a creature to help them, or something like that.

In general, just note down the minimum that you need to get on with the game, and then get on with it. Fill in more details if and when you need them.
