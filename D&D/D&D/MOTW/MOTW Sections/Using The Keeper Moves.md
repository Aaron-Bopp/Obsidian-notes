These [[moves]] are your main tool in play. Most of the time, when you’re saying something, it will be one of these Keeper [[moves]]. Here are the detailed explanations of them all:

*Separate them* is just that. You can arrange a separation lots of different ways. Maybe a monster grabs someone, maybe someone falls behind, or maybe you can just say, “While Francis is checking out the kitchen, you’re upstairs searching the bedrooms.” Anything to get [[the hunters]] away from each other and from the people they’re trying to help. Separating people can be used to make them vulnerable, or you can use it to put certain people together, away from the others, if you think that will lead to something interesting.

*Reveal future badness* allows you to hint at something that [[the hunters]] will need to deal with later. It can be obvious, for example when they see a person with a snake-like face approaching, or when they ask about what’s likely to happen as part of an **investigate** move. It can be subtle, such as you mention the sun is setting (and, by implication, that the [[monsters]] are coming), or they hear an indistinct noise ahead of them while they explore a haunted house. It could be something from your mystery countdown that will be happening soon. It could be something from one of your [[arcs]] that might not matter right now, but which creates awareness of bigger problems for [[the hunters]].

*Reveal off-screen badness* is similar, but it’s something happening right now, somewhere else. It could be things seen or heard in the distance (screams, sirens, a [[fire]], etc). Or it could be what’s going on from someone else’s point of view, such as a potential victim seeing the monster coming for them. You can even cut away from [[the hunters]], just like in a TV show, and show the players who is in danger, or who is up to something.

*Inflict [[harm]], as established* is used when a person or other thing in the world was being threatened with damage and nothing prevented it. The “as established” part is important—you can only inflict [[harm]] that is plausible and already present in the story. For example, if a hunter is pushed down a [[Flight]] of stairs you immediately have a good idea of the potential [[harm]]. It is likely they’ll be shaken and bruised, possible that they broke a bone or got a concussion, but they can’t suffer severe burns.

*Make them investigate* keeps the game moving. In each mystery [[the hunters]] need to find clues until they know enough to face the monster behind it all. If [[the hunters]] get stumped, ask them what they look for next. If they ask you for information, ask them how they find it out, then get them to make the **[[Investigate A Mystery]]** move. The answers from investigating depend on what the hunter did: by asking a witness questions they will learn different things than when they analyse samples in a lab. If [[the hunters]] ask a question and you can’t see how they could discover that, ask them to explain how.

*Make them acquire stuff*. Use this move when [[the hunters]] need something special, like they want to build a spirit detector, or cast a spell, or find an old book, or get a new weapon. Ask them how they pay for it, steal it, or find it.

*Tell them the possible consequences and ask*. Often, [[the hunters]] will want to do something but it isn’t a move. Let them know they can do it, but only if they pay a certain price or suffer certain effects. For example, you can get away through that vent, but you’ll have to leave your shotgun behind. Or you can grab that bag, but only by putting yourself in the firing line. The consequences could be a move, too: “you can do it, but you’ll need to **[[Act Under Pressure]]**.”

*Turn their move back on them* is for when a hunter misses a move roll. [[Whatever]] they were trying to do happens to them instead. If they were trying to **[[Protect Someone]]**, they made the danger worse. If they were **investigating a mystery**, they revealed something to the monster. If they were **using [[magic]]**, it has the opposite of its intended effect.

*Offer an opportunity, maybe with a cost*. If they need something, offer what they need and tell them what they need to pay for it. For example, maybe the sheriff will let them continue investigating in his town, but only if they guarantee his children’s safety.

*Take away some of [[the hunters]]’ stuff*. Things break. [[Weapons]] can be dropped. Vital equipment can be thrown across the room by a monster, or smashed to pieces. The “taking away” doesn’t have to be permanent, either: cellphones can lose the signal, the car could be out of gas, or a gas leak might make it too dangerous to [[fire]] a gun right now.

*Put someone in trouble*. Hunters are out to save people, so you need to provide people for them to save. Threaten [[bystanders]], endanger other members of the team, and send [[monsters]] after a hunter’s family. Plus there are other kinds of trouble as well, such as suspicious cops or neighbours who don’t like [[the hunters]] snooping around.

*Make a threat move, from one of the current mystery’s threats or one of your [[arc threats]]*. This list of Keeper [[moves]] is not the whole story. Each type of threat has its own list of [[Special Luck Moves]] it can make: see 0000575908 to 0000589791. Use these when [[the threats]] are present and active.

*After every move, ask what they do next*. Just as it says, every time you make a move, immediately ask what [[the hunters]] do next. Let them drive the action, by asking what they do next at every chance you get.
