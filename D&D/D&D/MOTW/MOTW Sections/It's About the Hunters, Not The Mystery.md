Another thing to remember is that although in each game of *Monster of the Week* [[the hunters]] have a mystery to solve, this isn’t really a game about solving mysteries. We want to see [[the hunters]] being awesome, and that requires that they solve the mystery and find out your secrets about what’s going on in the wider world. Then we see what they do with the answers.

We play for the times when [[the hunters]] realise they need to do something terrible, or put themselves in danger, or pull out all the stops. When [[the hunters]] make those decisions, and we play out all the consequences, that’s what this game is about.
