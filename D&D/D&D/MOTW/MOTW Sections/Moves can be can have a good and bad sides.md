Some of the [[moves]] don’t count as one against their count: that’s for [[moves]] that aren’t purely an advantage, but that have both a good and bad sideThe Initiate’s move when **in good standing with the Sect** is one of those: the move’s good and bad sides balance out, sThe Initiate gets another three choices of purely [[useful]] [[moves]].

Some playbooks have [[moves]] that are purely bad (the Monstrous’ curse and [[The Spooky]]’s dark side, for example). When a playbook has a purely bad move, give them an extra [[useful]] move to make up for it.

Not all the [[moves]] in the playbooks are explicitly called that, either. For example, [[The Expert]]’s [[haven]] is a move, but not referred to as one. Do this if your move is something special that doesn’t fit into the usual list of things the hunter can do.
