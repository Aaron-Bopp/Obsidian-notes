To create the mystery countdown, work out what will happen if the hunters never come to help. Remember, this is just your plan for what will happen until the hunters interfere, and the step names are metaphorical.

Then allocate them to the steps in the countdown. Countdowns have the following six steps:

- Day.
- Shadows.
- Dusk.
- Sunset.
- Nightfall.
- Midnight.
