To create the mystery countdown, work out what will happen if [[the hunters]] never come to help. Remember, this is just your plan for what will happen until [[the hunters]] interfere, and the step names are metaphorical.

Then allocate them to the steps in the countdown. Countdowns have the following six steps:

- Day.
- Shadows.
- Dusk.
- Sunset.
- Nightfall.
- Midnight.
