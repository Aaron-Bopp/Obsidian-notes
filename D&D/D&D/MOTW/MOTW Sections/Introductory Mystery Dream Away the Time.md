Here’s a first mystery you can use if you don’t have time to prepare your own.

This mystery, like any mystery, asserts that certain things will be true in your game. When reading it, decide if these things fit your vision. In this case, for the mystery to work it requires the existence of Faerie (along with the inhabitants of Faerie that are causing trouble in Handfast).

Mystery concept

The village of Handfast has a long-standing contract with Oberon, King of Faerie. In return for Oberon’s blessings of health and prosperity, the town needs to give up a beloved child every forty years at midsummer.

This pact was upheld for centuries, but the various upheavals of the twentieth century mean no-one’s left in Handfast who knows about it. The last child was given over to Oberon exactly forty years and one day ago. He’s angry and has invoked the penalty clause.

Hook

[[The hunters]] will be alerted to the mystery by the following events in Handfast and the surrounding farmland.

- One unusual weather event after another: a summer heatwave, a tornado, flooding.
- A spate of attacks in which a person alone, at night, has been beaten and suffered a single cut, but can remember nothing about the event or their attacker. This has happened four times over the past week.
- Accounts from a number of homes in town of food spoiling overnight, knives being blunted, objects being thrown about, and appliances failing.

Notes

This mystery is unusual in that the most dangerous supernatural being here (Oberon) is not the monster to be defeated (which is Bonecruncher the redcap). Oberon has set certain things in motion, but Bonecruncher is the immediate danger to the town and [[the hunters]]. Threat types are defined by their role in the mystery, which is why this one has Oberon as a “minion” even though he’s really in charge.

Aside from defeating Bonecruncher, the mystery has a few other threads [[the hunters]] might want to tie up.

- Oberon is indulging his desire for revenge due to the town’s betrayal, but for him this is quite a [[small]] betrayal. If [[the hunters]] propose some kind of reparation, he’ll be happy to leave the town to its own devices. Cunning hunters might even argue that the things he has already done are enough punishment for the town to consider the contract quit. Another angle they can take is that none of the people now suffering were parties to the contract (Oberon will respond that they benefited from his influence over the town, so are bound by the terms for that reason). Hunters could also call upon another major power as a mediator, but they would still need to successfully present their argument against Oberon. Note that it is possible [[the hunters]] may use **[[Manipulate Someone]]** on Oberon, but he will demand a high price, such as servitude for one hundred years, or a unique magical treasure.
- Bonecruncher could be sent away as one of the terms of a deal [[the hunters]] cut with Oberon, but otherwise the redcap will be left to roam and kill as he wishes.
- Violet poses another problem. She is currently happy being a member of Oberon’s court, but her family would love to have her returned. Hunters might think about restoring her memories of her mortal life, or breaking the glamours of Faerie. A disenchanted Violet will be unhappy to lose Faerie (and her friends there) but will gradually settle back into a normal life. And, after all, her fairy friends can still come and visit (that could be a starting point for a later mystery). Hunters can use **[[Manipulate Someone]]** on Violet as with any normal person, although her wants are rather twisted by her time in Faerie.

In case [[the hunters]] go looking for it: beloved children were sent to Faerie on Midsummer Day in 1615, 1655, 1695, 1735, 1775, 1815, 1855, 1895, 1935, and 1975. These dates assume a game set in 2015—shift them if your game is set some other time! The most recent disappearance must be 40 years back, and you can shift the town’s founding date from 1615 if needed to make it fit.

Threats

Oberon, King of Faerie

![[Pasted image 20210917185001.png]]

*Minion: Right [[Hand]] (motivation: back up the monster)*

Oberon has waited forty years and one day, and no beloved child has been given to him. As the contract is now null and void, he wishes to punish the town for their failure to live up to their end. In order to do so, he has dispatched two vassals with the orders, “Create chaos, scare them, perhaps even kill some of them.” The vassals are Violet, the last beloved child given to him (who has no memory of her life before she was brought to Faerie) and Bonecruncher, a redcap (an ogre who dyes his hat with the blood of his victims).

Most likely, Oberon will remain in his fortress in Faerie. Extraordinary events might draw him to the mortal world, but otherwise he will remain offscreen unless [[the hunters]] go and find him. Note that actually fighting Oberon is a terrible idea. When physically threatened, Oberon’s first action is to summon his army, which should give [[the hunters]] some idea of what they’re dealing with.

In person, Oberon is patronising and arrogant. After all, he is an [[Immortal]] elf-king and these are just a bunch of dirty human monster hunters. Try to give the impression that anything he does for them is an immense favour.

**Powers**:

- **Gift Of Power**: Oberon may gift mortals with various powers and traits, such as magical knowledge, [[luck]], bountiful harvests, or eternal youth. He will only do so for a very high price.
- **Glamour**. Oberon may appear in any guise he wishes, and likewise transform others.

Oberon has [[many]] other powers but those two will be the ones most appropriate for this mystery. If it really seems like he should have another power, feel free to add it for your game.

**Attacks**: Sword: 3-[[harm]] [[hand]] poison; Host of elf-knights plus goblin infantry: 4-[[harm]] hand/close/far [[area]].

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 15 bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

**[[Armour]]**: Faerie mail: 3-[[armour]] [[magic]]

**Weaknesses**:

- **Winter**. Note that this weakness is of little use as the mystery takes place a few weeks after midsummer day.
- **His Word**. If Oberon lies to or goes back on a promise or contract, [[The Wronged]] party has power over him, which counts as a weakness. As Oberon is aware of this, he will go to extraordinary lengths to never put himself in this position.

Oberon's Fortress

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: bring people and things together)*

This is in Faerie. [[The hunters]] may travel here to try and come to an arrangement with Oberon.

If you want, you can make the journey through Faerie a major task and extend the mystery. Alternatively, you can have [[the hunters]] **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to find their way, or have them meet a guide who will take them swiftly to Oberon.

King Oberon is very powerful and has hosts of fairies under his command, so [[the hunters]] should treat this as a negotiation rather than a battle.

Violet, a changeling

*Minion: Thief (motivation: to steal and deliver to the monster).*

Although 43 years old, her aging has been [[slow]] and she appears about 15. She wears silken elf-dresses, decorated with flowers and leaves. She is barefoot, but has her dagger and bag of dust on a woven belt.

This is the last human child given to Oberon. With no memory of her mortal life, she is a willing servant to the King of Faerie. She knows nothing of the mortal world, except that it is dangerous and people are not to be trusted.

Her current mission is to find the most beloved child in the town, and along the way take [[whatever]] revenge she wishes on the town that has betrayed her Lord.

Violet is curious about mortals, and playful, so [[the hunters]] can probably get her talking easily. Play her as unworldly and naïve, but a little wild and dangerous as well.

**Powers**:

- **Bane dust**. Violet has a large bag of this “pixie dust”. When cast about, it causes misfortune and mishaps (including spoiling food, making people ill, and causing things to fail or break).
- **Glamour**. Violet may alter her guise at whim, but may not change her size.

**Attacks**: Faerie dagger. 1-[[harm]] intimate/hand sleep [[magic]]. Anyone harmed by this dagger may also suffer “falls into an enchanted slumber” as a [[harm]] move.

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 7 Okay bbbb|bbb Dying

**[[Armour]]**: None

**Weaknesses**: She is a normal human.

Bonecruncher, a Redcap

*Monster: Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)*

A seven foot hulking brute, with red eyes, gray stony skin, and [[Sharp]] teeth. He wears a woollen cap dyed with blood, and a shapeless tunic that’s spattered with more.

Bonecruncher is working for Oberon, taking revenge on the town and keeping an eye on Violet.

Bonecruncher is a simple creature, desiring only to kill mortals to dye his cap and then eat their flesh. Oberon has given him strict orders not to kill anyone yet, but Bonecruncher’s hunger is growing and his will is quickly weakening. He’s taken to following people who are alone at night, concealing himself in a cloak of shadows, brutally beating them and cutting them a single time in order to keep his cap damp with their blood. With so [[many]] potential victims around it’s only a matter of time until Bonecruncher snaps and eats someone.

If [[the hunters]] talk to him, Bonecruncher will insult and threaten them, hoping to provoke a fight. If things go badly, he’ll call shadows to conceal his escape.

**Powers**:

- **Shadow Glamour**. He may cloak himself in shadows, and put shadows in people’s minds (this is why they don’t remember him).
- **Immense Strength**. He automatically beats any normal human in contests of strength.

**Attacks**: Razor-[[Sharp]] Poleaxe: 3-[[harm]] hand/close; Terrible Talons: 1-[[harm]] [[hand]]; [[Sharp]] Teeth: 2-[[harm]] [[intimate]] ignores-[[armour]].

**[[Harm]] capacity**: 9. bbbbbbbbb

**[[Armour]]**: None

**Weaknesses**:

- **Fresh Blood**: Needs fresh blood to dye his cap frequently. The weakness is activated if the cap is destroyed or stolen, or if the blood dries out.

The Old Forest Nature Reserve, near Handfast

*Location: Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)*

This is where Violet and Bonecruncher are lurking between attacks.

In the center of the forest is an overgrown stone circle. This is where Violet and Bonecruncher are camping, and it’s also the place where a portal to Faerie may be found. It’s elusive—difficult for mortals to find unless a fairy guides them or [[magic]] is used.

When a hunter uses [[magic]] at the stone circle, they may choose “Open a path to Faerie” as the effect. Any fairy (including Violet) may freely open or [[close]] this path.

![[Pasted image 20210917185106.png]]

Handfast, the Town

*Location: Hub (motivation: to reveal information)*

A remote town, settled in 1615 but [[far]] from the main trade routes. It is nestled in a fertile valley, and has a [[history]] of being a thriving farming town. More recently, it’s become a tourist [[haven]], as a lovely piece of [[history]] that’s off the beaten track.

The town has a quaint town square surrounded by shops, a few businesses nearby, and the rest is houses (for both locals and tourists).

Tornado And Flood Wreckage

*Location: Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

Parts of Handfast have been badly damaged by the recent freak weather events, and the abandoned and damaged homes are difficult to get through. Because the storms were supernaturally driven, the pattern of damage is arbitrary: some destroyed houses have neighbours that are perfectly fine.

Violet and Bonecruncher will both take advantage of these areas to hide or shake off pursuit.

Handfast Children's Park

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

Not [[far]] from the center of town is a large play [[area]]. Children will be found here after school closes and during the weekends. The play [[area]] has an elaborate (and huge) fairy-tale fort for the kids to climb on.

The fort is also a hangout of the village’s teenagers after dark on Fridays and Saturdays.

Violet can often be found here, watching the children play, and deciding which family she will target next.

Max Tilley, a beloved child

*Bystander: Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)*

Max is the most beloved child in Handfast. He’s a cherubic four year old, charming and full of laughter.

Mary and Samuel Tilley, Max's parents

*Mary—Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

Mary works at an artisanal bakery in the center of town. She’s tall, with short hair and doesn’t have any patience for messing about. She’s forthright, sometimes verging on rude, when dealing with people.

*Samuel—Bystander: Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)*

Samuel looks after Max and the family home (he’s also an aspiring writer). He’s a [[messy]] dresser, perpetually worried about something he might have forgotten to do.

John and Alice Chilton, Violet's parents

*John: Bystander: Official (motivation: to be suspicious)*

As a traditional breadwinner in his youth, John never quite recovered from the loss of his child, and threw himself into his career (he was a workshop foreman) to cope. Now that he’s approaching retirement, he’s feeling a little lost.

*Alice: Bystander: Helper (motivation: to join in the hunt)*

Alice had a different reaction to her loss—as the worst has now happened, the world holds nothing that can [[harm]] her any more. If she learns that her daughter is involved in the events in Handfast, she will do anything necessary to get her back.

If [[the hunters]] come to the Chiltons with news of Violet, they will initially view [[the hunters]] as crazies and disregard them. If [[the hunters]] can provide proof—most likely a photo, or leading Violet to her parents—then they will be eager to “get her back” and will accept and help with anything [[the hunters]] suggest—up to and including taking part in a [[magic]] ritual.

Officer Edward Turner

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

Officer Turner is the whole of the village police force, which is run from an office in the front room of his cottage. Optimistic by nature, he thinks that most likely this is pranks getting out of [[hand]]. In his experience, bad things don’t really happen in Handfast. Play up his geniality, and inability to really recognise the possibility of something terrible.

The four victims of the assaults all report the same thing:

- They were out at night on a routine chore or walk.
- It was very dark.
- They woke up, or were found and woken, to find they had been beaten and left with a big bleeding cut on their forearm. Some victims were cut on the left arm, some the right.
- An assault has taken place every second night. The next is due tonight.

The strange phenomena in peoples’ homes are even weirder. Things are messed up, gadgets and tools broken, and food gone bad. The victims are either families with young children or homes where everyone is over forty, but the Sheriff hasn’t picked up on that yet—a hunter might spot it if they get all the household details from the police.

Sheriff Turner has no idea what the heck is going on here. Maybe college students up to pranks? Who knows?

The Assault Victims

![](MotWIMG19.jpeg)

These are the four people attacked by Bonecruncher:

Unfortunately, they only provide [[useful]] information by omission. Each knows only the following:

- They were out at night on a routine chore or walk.
- It was very dark.
- They woke up, or were found and woken, to find they had been beaten and left with a big bleeding cut on their forearm. Some victims were cut on the left arm, some the right.

[[Magic]] (“observe another time or place”) can allow [[the hunters]] to see what really happened. CCTV footage is of limited use as Bonecruncher cloaks himself in shadow when attacking, although the result will definitely be suspicious, as a blob of shadow engulfs each victim.

Jane Howland, Editor of the Handfast Herald

*Bystander: Witness (motivation: to pass on information)*

Aged 48, Jane is old enough to have heard hints of the contract, and remembers Violet’s “death”, but has no reason to connect these or suspect a conspiracy.

She does, however, have a willingness to chat to visitors and a huge archive of Handfast Herald issues, all the way back to April 1830.

Investigating the archive looking for missing or dead children, or at mid-summer, reveals a pattern of “dead” children. Every forty years (in 1855, 1895, 1935, and—for Violet—1975), on midsummer day, a loving obituary is presented for a child between two and five years old.

The Crowne Tavern

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together).*

This centuries-old tavern is the main bar, diner, and restaurant for Handfast. Most anyone can be found here sometime, having coffee, a meal, or drinking in the evening.

Ely Holbeck is the owner.

Ely Holbeck, Bartender

*Bystander: Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)*

Well-used to dealing with tourists, Ely will happily “play along” with [[the hunters]] questions as long as they buy some food or drink. A young man, he’s got no knowledge at all of the contract, but if prompted for [[Weird]] stuff, he’ll mention that as a kid he used to go into the “haunted” spot in the centre of the Forest Reserve. He can describe how to get there (or show them himself, if given a good reason). Like all mortals, Ely will be unable to see the stone circle where Violet and Bonecruncher are staying without some help from [[the hunters]].

Other [[Bystanders]]

Use these templates as starting points for any other people [[the hunters]] talk to.
