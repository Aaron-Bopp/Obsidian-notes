*Most people don’t believe in* *[[monsters]], but they’re real. When someone finds out that [[monsters]] are real, it’s usually just before they get eaten.*

*But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that they live.*

*And some of those survivors go on a crusade against the [[monsters]].*

*That’s you.*

*It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil that comes there.*

*It could be that you take to the road and go hunt them down, wherever you can find them.*

*It could be that you have [[magic]] powers to put you on an even footing, or that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.*

*The one sure thing is that you* *aren’t gonna go back to your old safe life.*
