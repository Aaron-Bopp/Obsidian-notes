If you have advanced a basic move, you gain access to an even better result when you roll a 12 or more for the move.

For **[[Act Under Pressure]]**, on a 12+ you rise above the pressure completely. You may choose to either do what you wanted and something extra, or to do what you wanted to absolute perfection (so that people will talk about it for years to come).

For **[[Help Out]]**, on a 12+ you make the difference. The person you are helping acts as if they just rolled a 12 on their move, regardless of what they actually got.

For **[[Kick Some Ass]]**, on a 12+ you devastate and overawe your enemy. You inflict and suffer [[harm]] as normal, and pick one of these enhanced effects:

- You completely [[hold]] the advantage. All hunters involved in the fight get +1 [[forward]].
- You suffer no [[harm]] at all.
- Your attack inflicts double the normal [[harm]].
- Your attack drives the enemy away in a rout.

For **[[Protect Someone]]**, on a 12+ you defend them perfectly. Both you and the character you are protecting are unharmed and out of danger. If you were protecting a bystander, they also become your **ally** (pick a type for them as if you had taken the “gain an ally” improvement on [[leveling up]], see [[The Basic Hunter Moves]]).

For **[[Manipulate Someone]]**, on a 12+ you absolutely convince them. They do what you want *right now*. For a hunter, they must **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to resist your request. If they do what you ask, they mark one experience and take +1 [[ongoing]] while doing what you asked. For a bystander, not only do they do what you want right now, they also become your **ally** (pick a type for them as if you had taken the “gain an ally” improvement on [[leveling up]], see [[The Basic Hunter Moves]]) for the rest of the mystery (or, if you do enough for them, permanently). Note that allies can be lost, too! If they discover you’ve manipulated them into acting against their best interests, your new **ally** may become a threat to you.

For **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**, on a 12+ you may ask [[the Keeper]] any question you want about the mystery, not just the listed ones.

For **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, on a 12+ you may ask [[the Keeper]] any question you want about the situation, not just the listed ones.

For **[[Use Magic]]**, on a 12+ you are infused with magical power. What you wanted to do happens and [[the Keeper]] will offer you some extra benefit on top of that.
