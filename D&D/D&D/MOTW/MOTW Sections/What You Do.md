Your job as Keeper has two parts.

First, before each game you need to spend a few minutes inventing a mystery: a monster and a situation for the hunters to investigate and sort out.

Second, when you sit down to play, you are responsible for portraying the hunters’ world: describing the places, people and monsters they meet, and how those things react to the hunters’ actions.
