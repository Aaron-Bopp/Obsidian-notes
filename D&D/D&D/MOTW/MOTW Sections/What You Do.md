Your job as Keeper has two parts.

First, before each game you need to spend a few minutes inventing a mystery: a monster and a situation for [[the hunters]] to investigate and sort out.

Second, when you sit down to play, you are responsible for portraying [[the hunters]]’ world: describing the places, people and [[monsters]] they meet, and how those things react to [[the hunters]]’ actions.
