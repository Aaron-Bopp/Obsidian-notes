Tell them about the location and sketch a [[quick]] map of the [[area]] (or show them one you already prepared). Include important features, especially anything that was mentioned in [[the hook]]—where bodies were found, which house appears to be haunted, the location of the police station that filed the report, and so on. Then ask them “So, where are you going first? Are you all going or are you going to split up and cover more ground?” After this, let [[the hunters]] drive the investigation.

Play out [[the hunters]]’ interviews with normal folks, and their examination of places. If they meet [[bystanders]] you prepared with the mystery, use the details you wrote down. If they talk to someone new, give that bystander a name, and a bystander type (0000482535 and 0000582544).

Draw a map of everywhere they search, and everywhere there’s some action. Give each place a location threat type (0000488669 and 0000587195).

Ask Questions

All the way through this first mystery, you need to ask questions all the time. That’s how to get a handle on [[the hunters]]: how each approaches things, how the team works together, and how each hunter’s backstory is going to factor into the game. When they do something, ask them *how* they do it. If they want to know if they have a torch (or [[whatever]]), ask them “Do you normally carry one?” When they find out about an important location, ask them if they’ve been there before. If they have, ask them what it was like. Let everyone contribute to the world you are creating in your game, and, as Keeper, build on their answers to your questions.

Make notes of all the answers you get, in case you need them later.

Give them [[Tough]] Choices

The heart of the game is seeing what [[the hunters]] decide when they’ve only got an array of crappy options to choose from. Make sure they have difficult choices, and push at them to go one way or another.

There are any number of ways you can do this. Here are some of my favourites:

- a monster’s weakness that is terrible to take advantage of.
- a **[[Big Magic]]** ritual that has nasty stuff for its requirements.
- a monster that is, in its way, a victim.
- a simple but awful solution to the mystery’s central problem.

Call For [[Moves]]

Call for **investigate** and **manipulate** [[moves]] when [[the hunters]] look for clues. And if they go somewhere dangerous, suggest that they might want to **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**.

If a hunter wants to do some crazy, impossible stuff then remind them they can **[[Use Magic]]** for that sort of thing.

Use Your Keeper [[Moves]]

Keep in mind your agenda and principles (0000541652), and [[moves]] (0000559663).

Respond to [[the hunters]]’ actions with your Keeper and [[threat moves]]. Make soft [[moves]] that [[the hunters]] must deal with, and then make a hard move if they don’t deal with it (see 0000570605).

Recall that when a hunter misses a move roll (that is, their total is six or less), you get to respond with a move of your own (and it can be a hard move):

- For **[[Act Under Pressure]]**, things go to hell for the hunter.
- For **[[Help Out]]**, the hunter exposes themselves to trouble or danger.
- For **[[Kick Some Ass]]**, the hunter gets their ass kicked.
- For **[[Protect Someone]]**, the hunter makes things worse.
- For **[[Manipulate Someone]]**, the hunter angers or offends the target.
- For **[[Investigate A Mystery]]**, the hunter reveals something to the monster or whoever they are talking to.
- For **[[Read A Bad Situation]]**, the hunter reads the situation all wrong or reveals tactical details to their enemies.
- For **[[Use Magic]]**, the hunter loses control of the [[magic]] and anything can happen.

Remind [[the hunters]] that they can **help** each other, too, especially if someone just missed a roll by one (help can be given after a roll has been made). However **help** bonuses do not stack (e.g if three hunters successfully **help**, they don’t give a +3 bonus).
