When you play this game, most of you will create hunters, people who have devoted their lives to killing monsters.

One player will be the Keeper (that’s short for “Keeper of Monsters and Mysteries”). The Keeper will be in charge of:

- designing monsters and mysteries for the hunters to deal with
- bringing the world to life
- portraying the monsters and people the hunters meet.

The rest of you will decide how the hunters work together to investigate the weird situations they find, slay the monsters causing the trouble, and save the people in danger.

Your hunters aren’t normal people; you’re not even normal *monster hunters*. You are the ones who stand out, larger than life and twice as badass. You can change the world—save it, destroy it, or alter it forever. One way or another, you *will* make a difference.
