You also need to prepare yourself for how to run the game.

I’ve codified my best practices for running *Monster of the Week* into a ‘toolbox’ of advice. This toolbox owes a huge debt to Vincent Baker: in *Apocalypse World* Vincent described his methods for running that game. As he’s done, I’ll present an **agenda** for [[what you do]] as Keeper, what you should **always say**, the **principles** you use to create the world, and the **moves** you can make.

I’ll have more to say about these later, but I’ll present them here so you have them in mind while you prepare your first mystery.
