[[Luck]] scores are another measure of story progress. [[Luck]] will gradually get used up as you play.

If a hunter is getting to the end of their [[Luck]], that’s another sign their story needs to end. If not, they’ll be killed by a monster sooner or later (either because they can no longer reduce the [[harm]] they suffer, or because of a hard move you make against them).

Some [[hunter types]] have special effects as they spend [[Luck]], as well:

- When [[The Chosen]] spends [[Luck]], you need to include something from their fate in the game.
- When [[the Crooked]] spends [[Luck]], that means someone from their past is going to reappear soon.
- When [[The Spooky]] spends [[Luck]], the demands of their dark side will grow.
