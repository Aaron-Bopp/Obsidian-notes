This first mystery is going to be everyone’s introduction to [[the hunters]] and to your game’s world. Build a straightforward hunt, to give [[the hunters]] space to talk and get a sense of how the team operates. Pick a classic monster that everyone will recognise from folklore, urban legend, or pop culture.

Once you have a monster, come up with a [[basic concept]]. Think about what the creature could want, and what bad stuff is going to happen if [[the hunters]] don’t stop it. The bad stuff might be personal, local, or apocalyptic in scale.

I’ll build an example ghost story while we go through the process, to illustrate each piece.

*The [[basic concept]] is a haunted house story. There’ll be a ghost, murdered unjustly, who wants restitution and is lashing out at anyone who stays in the house.*

*Marie O’Connell is the angry ghost. She was murdered by her husband Damian (in an unjustified jealous rage) and subsequently drove him to suicide.*
