Arcs are like mysteries that play out slowly in the background. They describe things that are causing trouble for [[the hunters]] over the long term. Think of them like the season-long plots used in *Buffy* and *Supernatural*: a big bad monster and its [[ongoing]] plan is a perfect basis for an arc.
