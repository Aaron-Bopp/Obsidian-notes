Arcs are like mysteries that play out slowly in the background. They describe things that are causing trouble for [[the hunters]] over the long term. Think of them like the season-long plots used in *Buffy* and *Supernatural*: a big bad monster and its [[ongoing]] plan is a perfect basis for an arc.

An arc is made up of four basic elements, similar to a mystery. You can create them in any order you want, but I’ll go through them in [[the order]] I usually use:
- The [[Basic concept]].
- The [[Arc Threats]].
- The [[Arc Countdowns]].
- Optionally, some [[custom moves]].

**Look for things that have come up in sessions that pertain to larger events:**
- Hunters’ [[history]] choices that indicated a pattern of events or a significant incident.
- Events during the mystery that hinted at bigger troubles happening somewhere else.
- Unfinished business from the mystery.
- Hunter choices that have a wide reach, such as [[The Chosen]]’s fate, [[The Professional]]’s Agency, anThe Initiate’s Sect.
- Anything that came up in play that suggested something more is going on, or that a secret is waiting to be uncovered. [[Examples]] include the results of [[The Expert]]’s [[Dark Past]] move, or someone saying something interesting about their past (e.g. Keeper: “Have you ever dealt with a snake demon before?” Hunter: “Oh, sure, we got a lot of them back on the farm.”)

Arcs work fine without being fully detailed at first. Sometimes you’ll have only a few ideas about what’s going on. That’s fine: just note the details you have now, and fill in others as you think of them. Events in play will suggest further elements to be added in later.
