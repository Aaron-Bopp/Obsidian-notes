Often the rules for a move will tell you to roll, say, +[[Cool]]. This means you should grab two everyday six-sided dice, roll them, add them together and then add [[whatever]] number is written down for your hunter’s [[Cool]].

If it says something else instead of [[Cool]] (usually another rating), then add that number instead. So, if you are told to roll +[[Weird]], roll two dice and add your [[Weird]] rating. If you are told to roll +[[Tough]], roll two dice and add your [[Tough]] rating. If you have a negative rating, like -1, then you subtract one from your total instead.

The move description will say what the different results mean. Usually, 7 or higher is good, and 10 or higher is really good. A result of 6 or lower is a miss, which means [[the Keeper]] will have an opportunity to screw your hunter over.

*Example:*

*I need to roll “[[Manipulate Someone]].” That’s a +[[Charm]] roll, and my [[Charm]] is +1. I roll the dice and get a 2 and a 5. My total is 1 + 2 + 5 = 9. That’s a partial success for **[[Manipulate Someone]]**.*
