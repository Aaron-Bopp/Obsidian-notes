- Update injured hunters for [[healing]] since the last mystery. All [[harm]] is healed if there’s been time, or just 1-[[harm]] each if you’re following right on from the last mystery.
- Do [[start-of-mystery moves]] for hunters who have them.
- Tell [[the hunters]] [[the hook]].
- Let them investigate the mystery.
- Ask questions.
- Take note of everything you can.
- Put lots of horror into the stuff they find. Give them problems so they can show how cool they are as they solve them.
- Put pressure on the relationships in the hunter team, or on their relationships with [[bystanders]].
- When they meet someone you didn’t prepare, give them a name and bystander type (usually a **witness** or **victim**).
- When they visit somewhere you didn’t prepare, describe it and give it a location type.
- Make the action and fight scenes exciting.
- When a hunter misses on a roll, have them mark experience.
- When any character suffers [[harm]], use a [[harm]] move on them.
- Confront the monster! Hopefully [[the hunters]] win.
- Ask the [[end-of-session experience questions]] to see whether each hunter gets to mark zero, one or two experience.
- Think about how events in the mystery will affect your [[arcs]] or later mysteries. Tidy up your notes.
