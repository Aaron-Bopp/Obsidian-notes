I encourage the creation of custom [[hunter types]] for your game, and to share the results with other players and groups over the Internet. Here’s how to go about putting a new playbook together.

Concept

To start with, make sure your concept is good enough. If you can only think of a single example of your possible hunter type in fiction, the concept is probably too specific. But if you can think of a *type*, then it’s a good candidate. Aside from that, just go for something really [[Cool]].

Ratings

Rating lines should add up to three, and normally each hunter type has one rating that is always +2. If you give a line a second rating at +2, count that second +2 as a +3 instead.

*A normal rating line:*

*[[Charm]] +2, [[Cool]] +1, [[Sharp]] -1, [[Tough]] +1, [[Weird]]=0 (Total 3)*

*A rating line with two +2 ratings:*

*[[Charm]] -1, [[Cool]] +2, [[Sharp]] -1, [[Tough]] +2, [[Weird]]=0 (Total 2, but counted as 3 due to the second +2)*

[[The Monstrous]] always gets +3 [[Weird]], as a special case: there’s an unstated move that gives [[the Monstrous]] +1 [[Weird]].

[[The Chosen]] varies the rule as well: she gets two +2 ratings (each line has a different pair), plus each line adds up to four: [[The Chosen]] also has an unstated extra move to give her this advantage.
