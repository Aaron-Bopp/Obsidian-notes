If your hunter has been caught unarmed, and is just fighting with fists and feet, you do 0-[[harm]] hand/intimate. You can still hurt things if you have a bonus to [[harm]]. That could come from getting a 10+ on a **[[Kick Some Ass]]** roll, or a move you have.

If your hunter grabs a random object to use as a weapon, decide between you and your Keeper about how it is rated. Here are some guidelines:

- If it’s hardly more dangerous than a punch, 0-[[harm]] [[hand]].
- If it’s [[Sharp]] or [[heavy]] (kitchen knife, lamp), 1-[[harm]] [[hand]].
- If it’s really [[heavy]] (microwave, bar stool), 2-[[harm]] [[hand]] [[heavy]].
- If you can throw it, add “[[close]]” range.
