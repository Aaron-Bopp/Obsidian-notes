Begin the game with a scene to introduce [[the hook]].

The way you introduce [[the hook]] allows you to select a certain atmosphere and pace for the mystery. For example:

- Dramatize the most recent monster attack, showing the victim from the monster’s point of view.
- Ask [[the hunters]] what they are doing when they find out about [[the hook]].
- Describe [[the hunters]] at a diner near the scene of the latest attack, discussing [[the hook]].
- Describe [[the hunters]] at the scene of the latest attack, checking out the environment for clues and talking to witnesses.

The default is to start [[the hunters]] at the scene. Other options will increase the time it takes to complete the mystery and allow more time for [[the hunters]] to develop their characters and relationships. If you dramatise the monster attack, you may find it gives players who are new to the game a nice sense of competence when their hunters start investigating the mystery and ask the right questions.

Introduce the teaser and then ask [[the hunters]] what they’re doing. For example, are they undercover? What do they want to check out first?
