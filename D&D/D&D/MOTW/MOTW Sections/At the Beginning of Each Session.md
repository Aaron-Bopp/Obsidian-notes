If it’s a new mystery, have everyone who has a start-of-the-mystery move do it now.

Update the hunters’ harm to account for healing time:

- If there’s been some time to get treatment and recover, have everyone erase all harm.
- If you are following right on the last mystery, everyone gets 1-harm healed.
