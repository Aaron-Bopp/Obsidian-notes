In the first edition of *Monster of the Week*, the way hunters gained experience points was different. Here is the original system for those who prefer the it, or are interested in what it was.

Hunters do not mark experience on a missed roll (6 or less), and there’s no end-of-session list of questions that can earn experience.

Any specific [[moves]] that say a hunter marks experience are unchanged.

[[At the beginning of each session]], each hunter should pick another hunter on the team who they feel they currently have the closest relationship with. That hunter’s player picks a rating to highlight. Then [[the Keeper]] picks a second rating to highlight for each hunter.

Whenever a hunter makes a roll with a highlighted rating, they mark experience, regardless of whether the result is a hit or a miss.
