Now the mystery needs some threats. These are the things that will interfere with [[the hunters]] as they attempt to sort out the mystery.

Threats come in four types:

- **[[Monsters]]** (the big bad behind these events).
- **[[Minions]]** (allies of the monster, usually weaker creatures).
- **[[Bystanders]]** (normal folks who are involved).
- **[[Locations]]** (significant places).

Threat categories are more concerned with the role that the entity will have in the mystery than rigid definitions. Sometimes powerful creatures will be “[[minions]]” because that’s how they fit into the situation. In other cases, normal people could be a “minion” (if they’re inadvertantly supporting a monster) or even a “monster” (if they’re a mass murderer). Think about how the situation in your mystery is set up, and choose threat types based on which part each element plays.

**[[MONSTERS]]**

Start with the monster. Most mysteries will have just one: the single creature behind everything bad that’s going to happen.

[[Monsters]] need the following details:

- A description.
- A monster type and motivation.
- Supernatural powers.
- Attacks and [[armour]].
- How much [[harm]] will kill it.
- Any weaknesses it has.
- [[Custom moves]] for its powers (optional).

First, pick the monster’s type. The twelve types (and the motivations that go with them) are:

- Beast (motivation: to run wild, destroying and killing)
- Breeder (motivation: to give birth to, bring forth, or create evil)
- Collector (motivation: to steal specific sorts of things)
- Destroyer (motivation: to bring about the end of the world)
- Devourer (motivation: to consume people)
- Executioner (motivation: to punish the guilty)
- Parasite (motivation: to infest, control and devour)
- Queen (motivation: to possess and control)
- Sorcerer (motivation: to usurp unnatural power)
- Tempter (motivation: to tempt people into evil deeds)
- Torturer (motivation: to hurt and terrify)
- Trickster (motivation: to create chaos)

*In my example, Marie O’Connell, a ghost seeking justice, makes a good Executioner with the motivation “to punish the guilty.” To give her a reason to be angry at [[the hunters]], she wants to be properly laid to rest (Damian buried her under the basement floor), and treats anyone who isn’t actively doing that as one of the guilty parties she is punishing.*

Next up, think about the supernatural **powers** the monster possesses. Think about your initial [[inspiration]] for the monster and work out what it can do. There’s no particular level of detail you need for monster powers. Some might be a simple descriptive note, such as “can fly.” For others you might need more detail: note down as much about the power’s effects and limitations as you can think of (this is a custom move for the power: there’s more about them on [[0000915624]]).

*For powers, Marie has the ability to appear instantly anywhere in the house. And telekinesis which allows her to throw knives and stuff around, and [[hold]] doors and windows closed.*

*As she’s only a ghost, a lot of attacks won’t hurt her. Only attacks using rock salt, cold iron, or magic can [[harm]] her at all (I’m drawing [[inspiration]] straight from Supernatural here). This is a power that restricts what attacks can affect her. There’s also a special weakness that a monster has that must be used to kill her for good—that’s addressed below.*

Once you know the monster’s powers, it’s time to make a note of its **attacks**. Think about how it hurts and kills, and define an attack for each method. Attacks are described just like hunter [[weapons]]: how much [[harm]] is inflicted, the range of the attack, and any descriptive tags for additional effects. Pick something in the range of 2 to 4 [[harm]] for each attack.

*Marie’s attack uses her telekinetic powers. I describe this as 2 to 4-[[harm]] close (the exact [[harm]] will depend on what she has to work with: the kitchen will be especially dangerous).*

Now decide how resilient the monster is.

Decide how many points of **[[harm]]** will kill it. Take seven as your basic minimum (the same as a hunter). Increase it based on how large and robust the monster is. There’s no set maximum, but more than fourteen would be exceptional. Sometimes a monster might be more fragile, too: in those cases, reduce the [[harm]] capacity.

Secondly decide if it has an **[[armour]]** rating, based on its innate toughness or a power that makes it harder to hurt. 1- or 2- [[armour]] is normal. Higher values make it difficult for [[the hunters]] to hurt the monster, and no [[armour]] makes the monster very vulnerable.

*Marie is an averagely resilient ghost. I’ll set her [[harm]] capacity to seven. But I won’t give her any [[armour]]: her [[incorporeal]] power is enough for [[the hunters]] to deal with.*

Now think about a **weakness**. All [[monsters]] must have one, and most [[monsters]] have two or three. If the monster’s weakness is not used against it, then [[the hunters]] cannot kill it. Weaknesses come in three main types:

- Something that will [[harm]] the monster directly, such as using silver against a werewolf.
- An environment that weakens or harms the monster, such as sunlight against a vampire.
- A special ritual or action that must be taken, such as an exorcism to drive out an evil spirit.

Think about your idea about the monster, and decide what it will have as weaknesses.

*For weaknesses, I pick “her mortal remains” (that works well with allowing proper burial to lay her to rest) and “the house” (her association is so great that harming the house can also [[harm]] her).*

*Marie can be harmed by rock salt, cold iron, or magical attacks but she can’t be killed unless her body is properly buried or destroyed or unless the house is destroyed.*

If you haven’t already worked out what the monster is trying to achieve, give that some thought now. If the initial concept doesn’t suggest a plan, look at the type you have given the monster. Use the motivation as a starting point, and work out what is the *worst* thing that this monster could be planning to do here?

*Marie is obsessed with being laid to rest properly. She can’t communicate with anyone directly, she’s just going to violently attack them whenever they don’t seem to be helping her. If people persist in not helping, she’s just going to kill them. Because the family have been here longest without helping her, she’ll target them first.*

**[[MINIONS]]**

Decide if the monster is working on its own or if it has [[minions]] to help it. If it has [[minions]], detail them now. [[Minions]] can be weaker individuals of the same kind of monster, allied creatures of different kinds, human worshippers, or human (perhaps unwitting) servants.

[[Minions]] need the following details:

- A description.
- Minion type and motivation.
- Supernatural powers, if any.
- Attacks and [[armour]].
- How much [[harm]] will kill it.
- A weakness (optional).
- [[Custom moves]] for powers (optional).

There are ten minion types:

- Assassin (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]])
- Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)
- Cultist (motivation: to save their own skin at any cost)
- Guardian (motivation: to bar a way or protect something)
- Right hand (motivation: to back up the monster)
- Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)
- Renfield (motivation: to push victims towards the monster)
- Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)
- Thief (motivation: to steal and deliver to the monster)
- Traitor (motivation: to betray people)

[[Minions]] may have powers and weaknesses like a monster. They are usually weaker, but otherwise you can follow the rules and guidelines for monster powers and weaknesses.

Define attacks, [[harm]] capacity, and [[armour]] for all [[minions]]. Minion attacks should be in the 1- to 4- [[harm]] range. The amount of [[harm]] required to kill the minion should range from 5 to 10 (although weaker and stronger [[minions]] are both possible).

A group of [[minions]] can be defined the same as an individual. Do this if the [[minions]] are a gang or swarm of nameless goons or critters, to keep things simple. Define their attacks, [[armour]], and [[harm]] capacity to account for the group as a whole. A group of [[minions]] should have their attacks boosted by one to represent their multiple attacks. The group can be given a single [[harm]] track for all of the [[minions]]: [[harm]] taken represents defeat of the group as a whole.

If [[minions]] have [[armour]], they normally have 1-[[armour]], and only rarely 2-[[armour]] or higher.

*There’s no obvious [[minions]] in the situation so far, but I have an idea that Marie has a psychic connection with the rats that live in the house. They’ll make good [[minions]], probably mainly to keep an eye on everyone in the house.*

*The possessed rats are Scouts (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report). If they attack, they do 1-[[harm]] intimate as a swarm. 10-[[harm]] must be inflicted to disperse the group completely.*

**[[BYSTANDERS]]**

[[Bystanders]] are the normal people who are involved in the situation. They’re the victims, witnesses, interfering cops, and anyone else.

Each bystander needs the following details:

- A name.
- A description.
- A bystander type and motivation.

There are nine types of bystander:

- Busybody (motivation: to interfere in other people’s plans)
- Detective (motivation: to rule out explanations)
- Gossip (motivation: to pass on rumours)
- Helper (motivation: to join the hunt)
- Innocent (motivation: to do the right thing)
- Official (motivation: to be suspicious)
- Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations)
- Victim (motivation: to put themselves in danger)
- Witness (motivation: to reveal information)

Include at least two [[bystanders]]: it’s important to have some people for [[the hunters]] to save.

Start by defining the people directly involved in the situation: surviving victims, witnesses, official investigators. Think about why they are here, why they’re involved in the monster’s plan, and what they want to achieve. Coming up with those details helps develop them as real people, in a real world.

You generally don’t need to worry about how much [[harm]] a bystander can take (it will almost always be seven, the same as a hunter) or what their [[weapons]] are. If a bystander has a good chance of getting involved in a fight (helpers in particular might do this), note down what they’re armed with.

It’s a good idea to include some partially defined [[bystanders]]: just a name and type. You can use them in play for unexpected bystander characters: just add any extra details at the time.

*For [[bystanders]], there’s the family who’ve moved into the house. Their names are Mark and Andi Hadley and their kids Sean and Ashley.*

*The family moved to the country for Andi to get a rest after quitting a stressful job, and to help with Sean’s asthma. Mark has a job he can do from the country—he’s a web designer. Andi was a lawyer. Sean is 11 and Ashley is 6.*

*Now I need to pick which sort of bystander each one is.*

*Mark Hadley is a Skeptic (motivation: to deny supernatural explanations). Having him regard any talk of ghosts or magic as foolishness will give [[the hunters]] something they need to deal with: how do they handle Mark and still get the ghost sorted out?*

*Andi Hadley is a Witness (motivation: to reveal information). Because I’ve made Mark into someone difficult, I’ll make Andi helpful. At least, that will be her intention at first. Once things get strange and stressful, she won’t handle it well. Helpful [[bystanders]] are a whole new sort of problem for [[the hunters]]!*

*Sean Hadley is a Victim (motivation: to put himself into danger). I’m going for the easy “kids in peril” scares here.*

*Ashley Hadley is a Helper (motivation: to join in the hunt). I can see a six year old being totally fascinated by a team of monster hunters. Of course she wants to [[Help Out]]!*

*The [[bystanders]] could be rounded out with some more people in the town, but I think we have enough.*

**[[LOCATIONS]]**

![[Pasted image 20210917184700.png]]

[[Locations]] are places that can cause trouble for [[the hunters]]. They’re metaphorically hostile, encompassing all the stuff that can go wrong around [[the hunters]] (like the phones not working, or a car not starting, or getting lost and ending up alone in the dark).

[[Locations]] need the following details:

- A name.
- A description.
- Location type and motivation.
- Optionally, a map.
- Optionally, one or more [[custom moves]].

There are ten location types:

- Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)
- Deathtrap (motivation: to [[harm]] intruders)
- Den (motivation: to harbor [[monsters]])
- Fortress (motivation: to deny entry)
- Hellgate (motivation: to create evil)
- Hub (motivation: to reveal information)
- Lab (motivation: to create weirdness)
- Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)
- Prison (motivation: to constrain and prevent exit)
- Wilds (motivation: to contain hidden things)

Define a location for anywhere that you expect significant parts of the mystery will take place. Anywhere that is going to be an important scene of investigation or action, or where the monster is active should be written up as a location threat.

Good [[locations]] to start with are:

- The general area.
- The monster’s lair.
- Places where the monster has been active, or attacked someone.
- Places that the [[bystanders]] will be found.

Maps can help define the location so that everyone can see how it looks. Even a quick sketch of the area can help the group picture what’s going on and what the place is like. Another good source for town or region maps is to find an appropriate looking place in Google Maps and print it out.

*We have the O’Connell house. A location is an obvious fit, but what kind? Maybe it’s a huge, rambling place, making it a perfect Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate). That will give it lots of good [[moves]] to force [[the hunters]] to explore dark, cluttered rooms... alone. The house has one custom move: Once Marie closes the front door,* ***if you try to leave the house**, you can not get out. Only laying Marie to rest, or destroying her, will allow [[the hunters]] (and family) to leave.*

*There’s also the nearby town. It’s likely [[the hunters]] will do a bit of preliminary asking around, making a Hub (motivation: to reveal information) a good choice. The town’s small, not much more than a service centre for nearby farms. There’s a run-down motel that [[the hunters]] will probably end up staying in, a diner, and a couple of bars.*

[[More Threats]]

Just like the first mystery, your threats are [[monsters]], [[minions]], [[bystanders]], and [[locations]].
