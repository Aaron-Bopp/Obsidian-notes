If you get +1 forward, you get +1 on your very next roll only.

*For example:*

*Another hunter can give you a bonus of +1 forward as the result of a move. The next thing that happens is that you charge in to attack a monster. You get +1 on your **[[kick some ass]]** roll. If you had decided to **[[Use Magic]]** instead, to cast a protection spell, then you would have gained the +1 on that roll. Once you have used the bonus, it’s gone.*
