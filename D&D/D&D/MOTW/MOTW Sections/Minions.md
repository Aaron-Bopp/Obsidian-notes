Minions can be supernatural creatures (maybe weaker versions of a monster breed), or normal people (who could be voluntarily or involuntarily helping the monster). They can also be a group that work together.

Minions help the monster and work against [[the hunters]].

There are ten minion types:

- Assassin (motivation: to kill [[the hunters]])
- Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)
- Cultist (motivation: to save their own skin at any cost)
- [[Guardian]] (motivation: to bar a way or protect something)
- Right [[hand]] (motivation: to back up the monster)
- Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)
- Renfield (motivation: to push victims towards the monster)
- Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)
- Thief (motivation: to steal and deliver to the monster)
- Traitor (motivation: to betray people)

Decide on all the elements that you’ll need:

- Description.
- Pick the type (and associated motivation) for the minion.
- Note down all the supernatural powers it has, if any.
- Weaknesses, if any.
- Define its attacks: how much [[harm]] does the minion do (usually 2-4)? What range? Are any other tags required?
- How much [[armour]] does it have, if any?
- How much [[harm]] can it suffer before it dies (usually 5-10)?
- Optionally, [[custom moves]] for the minion’s powers.

As with [[monsters]], when your hunters are experienced and capable, you can make the minions tougher than these guidelines.

Remember minions may be a group of undistinguished foes as well as individuals. If you create a group minion, the [[harm]] capacity is how much is required to kill or disperse the whole group.

Example Minions

Here are two example minions, illustrating a couple of ways to create a minion that isn’t just a weaker version of a monster.

**HOMUNCULUS SWARM**

The homunculus swarm is a number of [[small]] critters. A golemancer has been building them from parts of dead people. They act as scouts and guards for the golemancer while she builds bigger and better versions.

They look nasty: strips of muscle, bits of bone, pieces of organs, an eye or three; all just kinda put together into a vaguely sensible shape, with varying numbers of legs, claws, and teeth. They’re not smart or, individually, very [[Tough]].

**Minion:** Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack).

**Attacks:** Individuals have an attack of 1-[[harm]] (if rat-sized) or 2-[[harm]], (if cat-sized). There aren’t any bigger ones (yet). If they attack as a group, then they have a 3-[[harm]] [[area]] attack. Range is hand/intimate.

**[[Harm]] capacity:** 7-[[harm]] will disperse the swarm. Each point of [[harm]] kills one or two individuals.

**CHUCK THE BARTENDER**

Chuck is [[the hunters]]’ good friend at their favorite bar, always happy to give them a couple of free drinks and to listen to them unload about their problems. Unfortunately, Chuck also makes a bit of extra money passing information back to [[the hunters]]’ biggest enemies.

**Minion:** Traitor (motivation: to betray people)

Chuck is friendly and a little too generous. He won’t do anything obvious against [[the hunters]], but make him just a little nicer than he needs to be. And make sure that the monster hears about everything that they tell Chuck (assume the monster knows how to fill in any gaps [[the hunters]] have left out because they are talking to a civilian).

Chuck’s just a normal person. He doesn’t have any special powers, attacks, or [[armour]].

[[Bystanders]]
