[[Monsters]] are usually a lot harder to kill than humans. [[Minions]] (lesser supernatural creatures) can be as well.

All [[monsters]] (and some [[minions]]) have *weaknesses*. That means they cannot be killed until you use their weakness against them. How to use a weakness against a monster depends on what the weakness is.

Weaknesses can include:

- Things that can be used as a weapon: e.g. [[fire]], cold iron.
- Specific methods of attack: e.g. a silver weapon, decapitation.
- Something to do: e.g. a [[magic]] ritual, a burial procedure.
- A harmful environment: e.g. sunlight, running water.

If you know the monster’s weakness, use it.

If you don’t know its weakness, find out using your [[moves]].

If you don’t use a creature’s weakness, it will come back, even if you win the fight.
