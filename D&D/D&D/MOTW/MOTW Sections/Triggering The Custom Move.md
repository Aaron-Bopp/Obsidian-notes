Carefully define when the custom move applies: having a specific trigger condition ensures that you know when to use the move. The trigger is there to enforce describing the move properly, so there’s no doubt about when it happens. Something like “when you go down into the sewers,” “when you call on the demon Uhul,” or “when you’re splashed with lamia-bile.”
