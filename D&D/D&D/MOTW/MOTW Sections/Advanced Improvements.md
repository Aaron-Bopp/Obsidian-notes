After a hunter has leveled up five times, they unlock the advanced [[improvements]]. That’s a list of new [[improvements]] you can choose from in addition to the basic [[improvements]]. From now on, when you level up choose from either the basic or advanced improvement lists.

Some of the playbooks have special advanced [[improvements]] of their own. These are unlocked at the same time (after five level-ups).

**+1 TO ANY RATING (MAX +3)**

Just like the normal +1 to a specific rating advance, except you can choose whichever you want. +3 is the maximum for any rating—once you’re there, you can’t improve any further.

**CHANGE YOUR HUNTER TO A NEW TYPE**

When you change your type, pick another playbook you wish to change to.

Your ratings and [[history]] stay the same.

You may change your name or look, if you want.

For your old [[moves]], check each one and decide (with [[the Keeper]]) if it is intrinsic to who you are, or just something you did for a while. If it’s intrinsic, keep that move. If not, erase it.

Then add new [[moves]] from your new playbook, as if you were creating a new hunter.

Finally, you may or may not get the new [[gear]], or keep your old [[gear]], depending what makes sense given the circumstances of your change.

**MAKE A SECOND HUNTER**

Create a new hunter to join the team. You can play both hunters at once, or maybe take turns, deciding which of them will come along on a mystery on a case-by-case basis.

Make up the new hunter as normal, except for [[history]]. Only pick [[history]] for [[the hunters]] played by different people—don’t tie your own hunters together with [[history]] picks.

**RETIRE TO SAFETY**

Your hunter retires to a safe place. They no longer actively hunt [[monsters]], and have found a place to live that’s safe from old enemies.

Give your hunter to [[the Keeper]] to look after from now on. They are safe from [[the Keeper]]’s threats, and never count as a threat themselves. Your retired hunter might, at your and [[the Keeper]]’s discretion, count as an ally for the other hunters.

**ERASE ONE USED [[LUCK]] MARK**

Erase a used [[Luck]] mark from your sheet. You have bought some time before Fate comes for you.

**MARK TWO OF YOUR BASIC [[MOVES]] AS ADVANCED**

This means you get better at the basic [[moves]].

There’s a new result for each advanced move, that applies when you roll a 12 or higher. These 12+ results represent the extraordinary levels of success you can now achieve. See below for details.
