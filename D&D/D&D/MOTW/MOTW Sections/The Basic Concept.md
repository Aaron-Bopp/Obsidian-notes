Decide on a starting concept for your arc. Mysteries usually start with a monster, but [[arcs]] can come from a wide variety of places: a hunter’s [[history]], unfinished business from a mystery, or a neat idea you have for an evil plan.

You may get some ideas for [[arcs]] right at the beginning of a new game when [[the hunters]] are created. Perhaps the team concept and backstory of the team suggests something. Some playbooks also have built-in arc seeds, specifically:

- [[The Chosen]]’s fate. Use the details that you work out with the player about what is in store for [[The Chosen]].
- [[The Divine]]’s mission may require an arc, depending on the details you worked out with the player.
[[The Initiate]]’s Sect and Professional’s Agency both deserve an arc. Use the choices the player made to decide what the organisation’s motivations are, and how these will affect [[the hunters]]. The organisation may mean well, but still cause trouble by accident. On the other hand, some organisations might have a sinister purpose for hunting [[monsters]].
- [[The Wronged]]’s loss: every Wronged should have an arc involving the creature(s) that caused their loss.
- Any player might make a decision during [[hunter creation]] that gives you an idea for an arc.

In all these cases, ask the player questions about their hunter and their [[history]], in order to tease out ideas you can use for an arc.

Another way to get arc ideas is to take unfinished business from the mysteries you play. For example:

- If [[the hunters]] failed to defeat a monster, it might decide to track them and get revenge. Alternatively, it might restart its evil plan somewhere else.
- If [[the hunters]] failed to notice and stop an evil plot, the plotters can move on to the next step in their terrible plan.
- If [[the hunters]] miss an important detail, it might start a new problem (for instance, a roach-person’s eggs are left in place to hatch a new generation).

Lastly, [[as the game goes on]] you might notice that previously unconnected facts or events make more sense if they were really connected all along. That is the seed of an arc. Maybe you’ve had two mysteries that both had a naga as the monster. Could there be a naga conspiracy that led to both situations? Think about what the nagas might be trying to achieve, and use that as your arc concept.

*An example arc:*

*Let’s say that there was a particularly annoying werewolf pack leader who eluded [[the hunters]]. She seems like a good choice to start an arc around (especially as the team has a Wronged who is hunting werewolves).*

*[[The hunters]] killed most of the werewolf pack, so the leader will definitely [[hold]] a grudge, and she was pretty smart in her tactics, so the idea of her starting a crusade against [[the hunters]] makes perfect sense.*
