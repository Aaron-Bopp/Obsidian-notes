Here are some example team concepts and the playbooks that work with them. Use them as they are, or as inspiration for your own ideas.

# Slayer and Entourage

There’s a chosen one, and their support group. Hopefully, together you’ll be able to save the world.

The team has a Chosen, who is at the centre of things. An Expert, Initiate, or Spell-slinger would make a good mentor. A Mundane or Flake could be a friend of the Chosen. A Divine, Monstrous, or Spooky gives the team some magical powers to draw on.

# The Unexplained Cases Team
You are all members of an ancient order of monster slayers.

You’ll need an Initiate. Everyone else makes up the tea[[The Initiate]] commands: the Spooky, Expert, Mundane, Flake, Crooked, or Chosen all work well here.

Everyone is a member of the Order, but initially onl[[The Initiate]] will have to deal with your superiors. As a customisation, anyone can tak[[The Initiate]] move for **when you are in good standing with the Sect** as a leveling up option ([[0000171217]]). Anyone may also substitute one o[[The Initiate]]’s old-fashioned weapons ([[0000179244]]) for a regular weapon choice.

# Road-tripping Hunter Family

Your family’s trade is hunting monsters. The nomadic life, drifting into town just long enough to find and slay whatever is causing trouble... well, it suits some of you just fine. Others, not so much.

This team concept suits the Wronged, Spooky, Divine, Expert, Flake, and Chosen best. A Monstrous could fit in too, but not comfortably. All the others except the Professional could round out the team. If there’s an Initiate, maybe the Sect is comprised of certain bloodlines, so everyone in the family is a member.

You are all family, or as good as family.

Oh, and make sure you have a cool car. Or a sensible anonymous car, if that’s your thing. If none of the hunters has a vehicle, you can decide the team gets one as a customisation.
