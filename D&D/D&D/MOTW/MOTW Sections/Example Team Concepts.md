Here are some example [[team concepts]] and the playbooks that work with them. Use them as they are, or as [[inspiration]] for your own ideas.

# Slayer and Entourage

There’s a chosen one, and their support group. Hopefully, together you’ll be able to save the world.

The team has a Chosen, who is at the centre of things. An Expert, Initiate, or Spell-slinger would make a good [[Mentor]]. A Mundane or Flake could be a friend of [[The Chosen]]. A Divine, Monstrous, or Spooky gives the team some magical powers to draw on.

# The Unexplained Cases Team
You are all members of an ancient order of monster slayers.

You’ll need an Initiate. Everyone else makes up the teaThe Initiate commands: [[The Spooky]], Expert, Mundane, Flake, Crooked, or Chosen all work well here.

Everyone is a member of [[the Order]], but initially odThe Initiate will have to deal with your superiors. As a customization, anyone can take The Initiate move for **when you are in good standing with the Sect** as a [[leveling up]] option. Anyone may also substitute one of The Initiate’s old-fashioned [[weapons]] for a regular weapon choice.

# Road-tripping Hunter Family

Your family’s trade is hunting [[monsters]]. The nomadic life, drifting into town just long enough to find and slay [[whatever]] is causing trouble... well, it suits some of you just fine. Others, not so much.

This team concept suits [[The Wronged]], Spooky, Divine, Expert, Flake, and Chosen best. A Monstrous could fit in too, but not comfortably. All the others except [[The Professional]] could round out the team. If there’s an Initiate, maybe the Sect is comprised of certain bloodlines, so everyone in the family is a member.

You are all family, or as good as family.

Oh, and make sure you have a [[Cool]] car. Or a sensible anonymous car, if that’s your thing. If none of [[the hunters]] has a vehicle, you can decide the team gets one as a customisation.
