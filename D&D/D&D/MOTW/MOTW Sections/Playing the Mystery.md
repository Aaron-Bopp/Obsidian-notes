This goes just like the first time, except you don’t need to ask so many questions.

As you go on, there’s room for more interaction with normal folks, for fighting tougher [[monsters]] or large groups of [[minions]], and stuff like that.

It’s also good to put pressure on the things that [[hold]] the team together. Say your hunters have a disagreement about how to handle a bystander who’s in the way. That’s interesting: it’s an opportunity to push and see what happens in a more intense situation. Take these tensions and put [[the hunters]] into positions where they have to make similar decisions. This is not something you do to mess with them: it’s being a fan. Being a fan means being interested in what happens when [[the hunters]] have to make hard decisions.

And you should play hardball with [[the hunters]]. They are awesome, and they have a load of different ways to avoid [[harm]] and stay alive. So have your [[monsters]] and [[minions]] hit [[the hunters]] as hard as they can. Do not shy away from making the [[monsters]] tough, and giving them attacks that could easily kill a hunter. Hunting [[monsters]] is not supposed to be easy or safe.

We’re not interested in [[the hunters]] having everything go their way. It’s much cooler to put them in bad spots, so we can be amazed by the ways they get out and to give them tough choices so we can find out what they truly believe in and what they’re willing to do.
