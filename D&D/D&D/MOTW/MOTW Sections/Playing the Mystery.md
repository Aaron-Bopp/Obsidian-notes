This goes just like the first time, except you don’t need to ask so [[many]] questions.

As you go on, there’s room for more interaction with normal folks, for fighting tougher [[monsters]] or large groups of [[minions]], and stuff like that.

It’s also good to put pressure on the things that [[hold]] the team together. Say your hunters have a disagreement about how to handle a bystander who’s in the way. That’s interesting: it’s an opportunity to push and see what happens in a more intense situation. Take these tensions and put [[the hunters]] into positions where they have to make similar decisions. This is not something you do to mess with them: it’s being a fan. Being a fan means being interested in what happens when [[the hunters]] have to make hard decisions.

And you should play hardball with [[the hunters]]. They are awesome, and they have a load of different ways to avoid [[harm]] and stay alive. So have your [[monsters]] and [[minions]] hit [[the hunters]] as hard as they can. Do not shy away from making the [[monsters]] [[Tough]], and giving them attacks that could easily kill a hunter. Hunting [[monsters]] is not supposed to be easy or safe.

We’re not interested in [[the hunters]] having everything go their way. It’s much cooler to put them in bad spots, so we can be amazed by the ways they get out and to give them [[Tough]] choices so we can find out what they truly believe in and what they’re willing to do.
