If your group wants to swap around the duties (who is [[the Keeper]], and who plays [[the hunters]]), the game can handle that without much trouble.

You’ll need to decide if you have all the game’s [[arcs]] open, for people to use how they want when it’s their turn to be Keeper, or secret. If the [[arcs]] are secret, then each of you will have to look after your own, and tie them into your own mysteries.

Then you can take turns as Keeper, each preparing a mystery and running it. I’d suggest that each current Keeper’s hunter take a break from the team (because tracking everything that your hunter and all the mystery threats are doing is too much to handle). You may want to consider a team concept that allows some of [[the hunters]] to be absent, whenever convenient, in a believable way. For example, you might all work for an organisation that investigates [[monsters]], with each team built as needed at the time: that way any hunter can be said to be on another case (or on leave) to explain their absence.

It’s also a good idea to keep a shared journal (or set up a wiki) with all the mysteries, [[monsters]], and other things you have encountered, so that everyone will be on the same page when re-using elements from earlier mysteries.
