Once [[the hunters]] get a handle on what they’re hunting, they’ll want to take it out. The following sections have a lot of advice for running [[fights]], but this is the overview.

Start [[fights]] somewhere interesting, with lots of stuff that can be used in move descriptions, by you and [[the hunters]]. Every fight scene should have a location threat type, too, so remember to use those [[location threat moves]] when appropriate.

Aim to have a couple of set-piece fight scenes: it’s really [[the hunters]] who determine how fast they catch the monster, but you still have a bit of control over the pacing via your [[moves]]. For example, if [[the hunters]] track down the monster early on and it feels anticlimactic, have the monster disengage or run away (perhaps using the monster threat move **escape, no matter how well contained it is**). Conversely, if [[the hunters]] are moving slowly, the monster might decide to attack them first (the monster threat move could be **show its full power**, **attack with great force and fury**, or **attack with stealth and cunning**), or it could send [[minions]] after them **(**monster: **order underlings to do terrible acts**, [[minions]]: **a burst of sudden uncontrolled violence**, **a coordinated attack**, **give chase).**

Try to hurt [[the hunters]]: they have plenty of [[Luck]] at the beginning so they are not any real danger. A hard fight in the first mystery sets an expectation of danger and risk for the game, which helps create a sense of horror.

Keeping [[Fights]] Interesting

There are going to be a lot of [[fights]], and you need to keep them novel. It’s easy to fall into giving everyone a turn, [[the hunters]] each rolling **[[Kick Some Ass]]** one at a time, but that’s dull.

I’m going to present a variety of techniques to keep fight scenes exciting. Use them in your game (with your Keeper [[moves]]) whenever you can. The techniques are:

- Think about what’s at stake.
- Decide who has the initative.
- Use the environment.
- Make maps.
- Apply weapon tags.
- Be creative with [[moves]].
- Most times, do the obvious thing.
- Balance spotlight time.
- Don’t drag things out
- Use soft [[moves]] to set up hard [[moves]].

**THINK ABOUT WHAT’S AT STAKE**

There are a lot of reasons for [[the hunters]] to get into a fight. Think about what their enemies want. If a monster is fighting to destroy [[the hunters]] before they kill it, then it has more at stake than if they caught it sneaking around. In the first case, it might fight to the death. In the second, maybe it just wants to run away.

Take a moment to work out what the combatants want to achieve, and that will help you pick their tactics.

**DECIDE WHO HAS THE INITIATIVE**

When a fight starts, pick who gets the first move, and base your decision both on what’s happening and in accordance with your agenda and principles.

If a hunter just missed a **[[Read A Bad Situation]]** roll, maybe the first she knows about the troll is when it attacks. Conversely, if [[the hunters]] have made a concerted effort to infiltrate a lair undetected, they’ll be the ones attacking without warning.

Other times, both sides are aware of each other. Use your common sense here, and base the decision on what’s happening, as always in accordance with your agenda and principles.

If a hunter or a monster is using a weapon that has the ‘[[quick]]’ tag they will normally go first, and anything tagged ‘[[slow]]’ will normally go last.

**USE THE ENVIRONMENT**

To keep [[fights]] fresh, make sure the action, your [[moves]] and questions all take advantage of where it’s happening. Whether it’s in a house, sewer, street, or cave, think about what makes this particular location unusual for this sort of place (and always include something unusual, something that sets it apart from average).

*For example:*

*This house looks rundown but normal, except there’s a dusty smell from the piles and piles of magazines everywhere. Looks like the owner really loves National Geographic.*

*The leshy disappears into the forest and as you reach the edges you see the whole place is damp and marshy, with mud and moss that your feet start sinking into.*

The extra details in both those [[examples]] might not directly affect what happens in the game (although they might). They create a much more evocative picture in the imagination than “It’s a rundown house” or “The leshy disappears into the forest” would have done, which can help inspire [[the hunters]] when they’re deciding what to do

You should also decide on a location threat type every time a fight takes place. This provides you with hints about how to describe the place (based on its motivation), and gives you access to the [[location threat moves]].

**MAKE MAPS**

Drawing a map is a good idea, and will give everyone an agreed picture of the space and who is where. Make sure you include details that [[the hunters]] (and their enemies) can use to their advantage. Use details like what furniture is present, where the slimy puddles are, the iron candlesticks around the temple altar, where the traffic is rushing past. Even if [[the hunters]] don’t use these things, you can. When someone is hurt don’t just say that they take [[harm]]. Say that they get thrown at the altar, knocking candlesticks everywhere.

**APPLY WEAPON TAGS**

Pay attention to the tags of the [[weapons]] used in the fight, so you can work them into your descriptions of what’s going on. [[Many]] of the weapon tags can influence the direction of the fight and the story in unpredictable directions. As well as [[the hunters]]’ weapon tags, use the monster’s and [[minions]]’ attack tags.

Make sure that you take weapon range tags into account, too. If a weapon is being used out of its normal range, that will be a disadvantage to the wielder. That might prevent it from being used at all, or it might be less effective (e.g. causing less [[harm]] than usual, or requiring an **[[Act Under Pressure]]** to use it properly).

**BE CREATIVE WITH [[MOVES]]**

Vary [[the Keeper]] [[moves]] you use. If you find yourself repeating the same sort of thing, take a moment to check [[the Keeper]] [[moves]] list and think about what else could happen right now.

Call for [[the hunters]] to use **[[Act Under Pressure]]**, **[[Help Out]]**, **[[Protect Someone]]**, and **[[Read A Bad Situation]]** whenever an opportunity comes up, so [[the hunters]] do not just use **[[Kick Some Ass]]** all the time.

Remember that you can also use the move **inflict [[harm]] as established**. If an attack doesn’t require the hunter to expose themselves to danger, just let them **inflict [[harm]]** instead of asking them to **[[Kick Some Ass]]**.

Make sure [[the hunters]] always describe what they are doing in detail. If they’ve used enough detail, you’ll find it easy to work out how to react.

When a hunter misses a move roll, think a little about [[What Could Go Wrong]], given what they tried and what else is happening.

*For example:*

*Terry (playing the hunter Isis) says “I shoot the cyclops slug.” You can ask “Okay, where do you shoot it?” or “Are you leaning around the doorframe or coming into the passage to get a clear shot?” or “Is it a carefully aimed shot or [[quick]] shot?”*

*If Isis misses her **[[Kick Some Ass]]** roll, then you can react based on the answer:*

- *If she shot it in the face, it could blind the single eye.*
- *If she shot it in the body, it can’t come at her so fast.*
- *If she went into the passage, it can slime her.*
- *If she stayed in the doorway, it can smash through the wall.*
- *If she tried to get a careful shot, maybe the cyclops slug rushed her before she could [[fire]].*
- *If she tried a [[quick]] shot, maybe it hits something else important (a victim, or a gas pipe maybe?)*

**MOST TIMES, DO THE OBVIOUS THING**

Don’t get hung up on trying to always think up the most innovative, creative thing to do. Usually, if you think about what exactly is happening, it will be obvious what should happen next (whether you are deciding how a monster reacts, or what move you should make in response to what a hunter just did). In those cases when there is a single, obvious thing to do next, trust your instincts and do it.

**BALANCE SPOTLIGHT TIME**

You need to strike a balance between spotlight time (giving each hunter a turn) and doing what is obviously next. E.g. if one hunter keeps attacking the [[monsters]], take a break from them to check what everyone else is up to (even if the fight is the main thing that is going on).

If some of [[the hunters]] don’t join the fighting, ask them what they’re doing while it goes on. Give these activities just as much emphasis as the combat: those hunters might be able to help save the day with [[magic]], or a non-combat use of a monster weakness, or some other cunning plan.

**DON’T DRAG THINGS OUT**

Don’t be afraid to resolve [[fights]] quickly, especially if [[the hunters]] are fighting outclassed [[minions]], or a difficult bystander. One successful **[[Kick Some Ass]]** can be enough to win an easy fight. Remember that [[many]] [[minions]] and most [[bystanders]] won’t just fight to the death: they might surrender or flee after a single hit.

**USE SOFT [[MOVES]]**

Don’t just use hard [[moves]] on [[the hunters]] (or anyone else). Use soft [[moves]] that prepare for a follow-up hard move, giving [[the hunters]] a chance to do something about [[whatever]] is coming.
