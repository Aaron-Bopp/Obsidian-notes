You get an experience point whenever your roll totals six or less, or when a move tells you to. Mark your next experience box.

Whenever you mark the fifth experience box on your playbook, you **level up**. Erase all five marks and choose an improvement from the list in your playbook. Mark the [[improvements]] off as you take them: each can only be selected once.

Then you start collecting experience marks again, until you level up again when you get another five experience points.

When you have leveled up five times, you can start choosing from the [[advanced improvements]] list as well (Act Under Pressure).
