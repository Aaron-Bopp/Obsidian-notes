These are only available to [[the hunters]] of the type listed. They become available after you have leveled up five times, the same as the usual [[advanced improvements]].

**FOR [[The Chosen]]**

- Delete one doom tag from your fate, and (optionally) change one heroic tag as well.

**FOR [[The Divine]]**

- Change your mission. When you choose this, you accept that your initial mission has failed, that it is impossible, or that things have changed too much to continue. [[Whatever]] the reason, decide with [[the Keeper]] what your new mission is. If none of the original choices are right for you, make up something new.

**FOR [[The Initiate]]**

- Become the leader, or effective leader, of the whole Sect. 

This operates similarly to becoming the leader of your chapter. You are now in charge of everything. You don’t have superiors any more (except maybe divine ones), but you’ll still have to manage the factions within the Sect to get things done.

**FOR [[THE MONSTROUS]]**

- You have freed yourself from the curse of your kind: your curse no longer applies, but you lose 1 [[Weird]].
- You turn evil (again): retire this character, they become one of [[the Keeper]]’s threats. 

Turning evil takes your hunter out of your control permanently. The character is now a threat, for [[the Keeper]] to use against [[the hunters]]. Given how [[many]] of the team’s secrets your hunter knows, this option shouldn’t be chosen lightly!

**FOR [[The Professional]]**

- You can get some or all of [[the hunters]] hired by your agency (they’ll get the **[[deal with the agency]]** move, as well as salary and benefits). 

All [[the hunters]] you pick are now Agency employees. They all get the [[deal with the Agency]] move, and everything else that goes along with being an agent.

**FOR [[The Spell-Slinger]]**

- You may cross off another option from your [[Tools and Techniques]]. This works just like when you first created your Spell-slinger—you are now less restricted in your spell casting.

**FOR [[The Spooky]]**

- You discover how to use your powers at a lower price. Delete one dark side tag permanently.

**FOR [[The Wronged]]**

- You track down the specific monster(s) responsible for your loss—[[the Keeper]] must make the next mystery about them. 

Note that this doesn’t mean you get to automatically win. You just get a shot at them. Keeper, [[The Wronged]]’s targets should be central to the next mystery but otherwise create the mystery as normal.

- Change the target of your vengeful rage. **[[I Know My Prey]]** now applies to these [[monsters]] instead.
