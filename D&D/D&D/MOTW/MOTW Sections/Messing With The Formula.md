The instructions above are the formula for a normal *Monster of the Week* mystery. But if every mystery ends up being built the same way it will get boring. Change things up now and again to prevent that.

Here are some ideas of how to do this:

- Give the mystery two [[monsters]], at odds with each other. Maybe [[the hunters]] will have a chance to team up with one, in a “my enemy’s enemy...” sort of story? Maybe *both* [[monsters]] need to be stopped?
- Revisit a person, place, or monster that was especially memorable. This is a good way to build up your game’s mythology and to advance an arc. Returning to elements that you’ve used before means there will be associations and prejudices built in. Make sure to get your notes from the previous time(s) and update each threat: think about what’s the same and what has changed.
- There’s no monster at all. This could be due to the situation having a [[Weird]] but natural explanation. Or it could be that there is supernatural weirdness about the place (a location threat) that needs to be dealt with. You could even have a monster with a pseudo-scientific explanation (like a mind-controlling fungus, or a deadly disease). These options work great for a game inspired by *The X-Files* or *Fringe*, where the team is not necessarily hunting [[monsters]], but instead investigating [[Weird]] events. 

You can write up a [[Weird]] phenomenon as if it were a monster, complete with motivation, powers, and attacks. For a weakness, decide what [[the hunters]] need to understand to prevent any [[ongoing]] danger. When [[the hunters]] investigate the mystery, they can learn more about the phenomenon’s origin, effects, and how to stop it.

- There’s no monster, but instead low-powered [[minions]] are the problem. A plague of giant spiders, for example, could work this way.
- A session where [[the hunters]] are off-duty gives an opportunity to explore the relationships in the team, and with their friends and family outside the team as well.
- The discussion of [[one-shot games]] (0000906294) includes some ideas for more intense, self-contained mysteries that you can use in an [[ongoing]] game as well.
- A flashback mystery could explore aspects of the team’s [[history]] (such as when they met, or events that intrigued you from the characters’ backstories).
- There are no [[bystanders]]. In this sort of mystery, maybe [[the hunters]] are thrown into a remote location with only unnatural horrors for company. There won’t be any time for chatting to normal folks, you’ll be too busy staying alive.
- A comedy episode. Set things up to be silly, maybe in a way that pokes fun at [[the hunters]] and yourself. You can steal one of the comedy episode ideas from *Buffy*, *Angel* or *Supernatural,* and then adjust it to make your own version.
- A mystery based directly on what’s happening in one of your [[arcs]]. This will contribute to the [[ongoing]] plot, and can help alert [[the hunters]] about the bigger problem.
- A deadly mystery, where the players all create [[Hunter types]] with just 1 or 2 [[Luck]]. Use the tweaks for a one-shot game (0000906294), and aim to kill them all. These events can then become the background for a mystery with the normal hunter team, and may illustrate something about an arc they [[haven]]’t noticed yet.
- You can present [[the hunters]] with hooks for two (or more) mysteries, and let them decide which one they want to deal with. This is a very high-stakes [[Tough]] choice, especially if [[the hunters]] can see the mysteries relate to different evil plots they need to stop (i.e. your [[ongoing]] [[arcs]]). Once the first mystery has been dealt with, you’ll need to decide how things have worsened in the other situation(s): the countdowns may have advanced a little, or a lot. Make these decisions based on your [[Keeper agenda]], principles and what you [[always say]].

In the end though, take any [[Cool]] idea you have, write it up as a list of threats and you’re good to go.
