Here are some simple skeletons for mysteries that allow you to slot in a monster and build up the rest of the mystery quickly. Use them as-is if you’re in a hurry, or as [[inspiration]] for your own mysteries.

# A BUG HUNT

A straightforward monster hunt. Bug hunts suit [[monsters]] that have simple motivations, such as a devourer, torturer, beast, or executioner.

**Hook:** There have been one or more killings which, to those in the know, are obviously the work of an unnatural creature.

**Threats:**

- The monster.
- A location: the general vicinity.
- A location: the monster’s lair.
- At least two [[bystanders]] to be potential witnesses and victims (some sympathetic, others annoying).

**Countdown:**

# An Evil Ritual

> A monster (or an evil human sorcerer) is planning a terrible ritual to unleash horrors upon the world.

**Hook:** An ancient prophecy, a vision of the future, or everyday investigation and research tells [[the hunters]] that the ritual is going to occur. **Threats:**

- A monster.

- Some [[minions]] (including your sorcerer, if you have one).

- A location (the ritual ground---most likely a hellgate).

- At least one bystander (a potential sacrifice).

**Countdown:**

# NOT WHAT IT SEEMS

This template is used for mysteries that start out looking like one sort of monster but which turn out to be something else (maybe just a different variety of that type, maybe something totally different).

You’ll need to come up with the monster, and work out why it initially seems to be something else. Is it intentionally trying to throw off the scent? Is it a different variety with different motives and habits?

**Hook:** A death that appears, to those in the know, to be a certain sort of monster.

**Threats:**

- A monster.
- The area where the attacks are happening.
- Lots of [[bystanders]].

**Countdown:**
