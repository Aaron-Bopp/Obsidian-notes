[[Arcs]] and [[arc threats]] may have [[custom moves]], the same as mysteries and mystery threats (the rules for [[custom moves]] are on 0000916117). Think about creating [[custom moves]] for threats that [[the hunters]] will deal with directly, or to highlight special features of the arc.

*For example:*

*This arc relies on the werewolves “recruiting,” so let’s think about how that happens. I don’t want it to be every time you get hurt by a werewolf, maybe it has to be a serious injury?*

***When a werewolf attack causes 4-[[harm]]**, you start becoming a werewolf. You’ll be feverish all the time, and suffer random pains. As the full moon approaches, you’ll have sharper senses (especially smell, hearing, and night vision) and crave raw, bloody meat. The transformation may be stopped by a [[Big Magic]] ritual, or treatment with silver (anything that will affect the whole body, such as colloidal silver capsules, will do). If not cured by the next full moon, you’ll transform and it will be too late to save you: change your playbook to Monstrous. Note that almost no [[bystanders]] who suffer such a werewolf attack will be able to cure it, so they will almost all be turned.*
