After each mystery, look at each of your arcs and think about what got revealed in play. If something relevant happened, update the arc with the new, altered, or defeated threats.

Advance countdowns based on events in play or off-screen. You should do this if events during the last mystery pointed to it (for example, if the hunters failed to foil the evil plot), or if it has been so long that the next event in the arc countdown would have happened (for example, isolated reports of zombies over the past couple of months become widespread reports of zombie attacks).

If you advance an arc due to off-screen events, you should make the next mystery about that arc so the hunters have a chance to stop it progressing further.

Also, an arc countdown might suggest an idea for the next mystery, even if it’s not directly tied to the countdown advancing.
