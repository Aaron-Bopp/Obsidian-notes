[[The Keeper]] principles are twelve specific ways to apply your agenda:

- Put horror in everyday situations.
- Address yourself to [[the hunters]], not the players.
- Use [[the Keeper]] [[moves]], never use their names.
- Be a fan of [[the hunters]].
- Build up a coherent mythology of the world as you play.
- Nothing is safe. Kill [[bystanders]] and [[minions]], burn down buildings, let [[monsters]] be slain.
- Name everyone they meet, make them seem like normal folks.
- Ask questions and build on the answers.
- Sometimes give [[the hunters]] exactly what they earned, rather than everything they wanted.
- Think about what’s happening off-screen.
- You don’t always have to decide what happens.
- Everything is a threat.

Using [[the Keeper]] Principles

[[The Keeper]] principles keep your agenda at the front of your mind. Here’s more detail on each of the principles:

*Put horror in everyday situations* because that’s a way to make it hit home. If the victims are regular people, just like us, then that gives the horror emotional bite. Plus we’re creating a world almost like the real one.

*Address [[the hunters]], not the players* to keep things immediate. If you talk to Diana the hunter instead of Stefan the player, you’re putting him into that zone, where he needs to deal with what Diana has in front of her right now.

*Make your move but never use its name.* You have a list of [[moves]] you are allowed to make (see 0000559663). You should not, however, tell [[the hunters]] that you are picking a particular move from the list. Tell them what happens in the story, the actions that comprise your move. *“The swamp gargoyle grabs you and leaps up onto the roof, leaving everyone else in the alley”* is a lot more interesting than *“I separate you! Francis, you’re grabbed and on the roof now.”* Grounding your [[moves]] in the events of the game keeps the sense that things are happening because they make sense, rather than that you picked an option from a list.

*Be a fan of [[the hunters]]* because that’s the whole point of the game. We’re here to see how awesome these hunters can be. Your job is to make life hard for them, but only so you can see how the hell they get out of their next predicament!

*Build up a coherent mythology of the world as you play* is another way to make the world seem real. When [[the hunters]] fight a vampire, it should have the same instincts, powers and weaknesses as the vampire they fought a month ago (unless you already know that there are several kinds of vampire, of course.) Keep track of what’s happened, and how it fits together. Then you can start working out the deeper truths that underlie it all.

*Nothing is safe* because this is a horror game. The [[monsters]] are going to kill people (or worse) unless [[the hunters]] stop them. And the same goes for your [[monsters]] and [[minions]]: when [[the hunters]] track them down, let them die. Let stuff burn, explode, or fall into a magical rift forever.

*Name everyone they meet, make them seem like normal folks* is there to make [[the hunters]] want to save these people. But normal folks could be jerks, or dumb, or annoying, and they still need to be saved. If [[the hunters]] meet a bystander a second time, make sure that bystander remembers what happened last time and acts based on what [[the hunters]] did then.

*Ask questions and build on the answers* helps you populate the world. At the beginning, none of you know what the story is here. You’re going to invent details as you fill the world, but some of this is up to the other players. When a hunter does something, ask how they do it. What did it seem like to everyone else? Why do they do it that way? Have you fought one of these creatures before? What did you learn then? Use the answer they give you and expand on it: build it into the game’s mythology and into the mysteries and recurring threats you create.

*Sometimes give them exactly what they earned, rather than what they wanted* keeps things interesting. Usually it’s pretty obvious what [[the hunters]] want when they make a move, but you don’t have to give them more than the rules say. For example, say someone chooses “Who’s most vulnerable?” Your answer could be “Well, you can see where another ghoul is hiding, you could get behind it” but sometimes the answer is “the one that’s half dead on the floor in front of you.” Don’t always do this—remember to do what your preparation and honesty demand (see the [[always say]] section, below). But, sometimes, just do what the rules demand.

*Think about what’s happening off-screen* is a reminder that what you’re focused on right here and now isn’t the only thing that’s going on. What is the monster doing at the moment? What about the people [[the hunters]] talked to before? Who is in danger and who is up to something? If [[the hunters]] have split up, what are the others doing?

*You don’t always have to decide what happens.* Sometimes there are places where you have a choice—for instance, would the monster kill this victim right now?—and you don’t have a clear idea how it should play out. Maybe you can give [[the hunters]] a chance to intervene. Or you could think about what’s going through this monster, minion or bystander’s head, and let *them* decide. Does the monster really want to kill that person, or would it maybe take them captive, or maybe scare them and leave? Or maybe the victim has a plan? You don’t need to make every single judgment based on some unattainable perfect first impulse. There are other ways to work it out.

*Everything is a threat*. Obviously the [[monsters]] and [[minions]] are threats, but so is everything else. “Threat” here is meant very broadly—a threat is anything that’s going to make trouble for [[the hunters]]. So even the people [[the hunters]] are trying to help are going to be threats. They’ll get in the way, or panic, or do something really stupid. That applies to everything else that turns up in the game, too. Places, objects, cults, police departments. Everything is a threat.
