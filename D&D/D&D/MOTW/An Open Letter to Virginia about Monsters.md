An Open Letter to Virginia about [[Monsters]]

Your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a cynical age. They do not believe except in what they see. They think nothing can be that is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be adult’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe of ours, humanity’s intellect is that of a mere insect, as compared with the boundless world about us, as measured by an intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.

Yes, Virginia, there are [[monsters]]. They exist in the finest products of our imagination, like in Michael Sands’ *Monster of the Week* tabletop RPG rulebook. They exist in popular “monster hunting” television shows like *Supernatural* which inspired Mr. Sands’ creation and has currently been in production for over a decade. Other classic “monster hunting” shows like *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* or *Angel* can also show you [[many]] other inspirational [[monsters]].

The truth is, Virginia: [[monsters]] are everywhere.

The key is to define your genre properly. To find really [[Cool]] [[monsters]] you must look for books, films, and television shows about “monster hunting.” This is any sort of story where a supernatural or alien creature exists and a special method is required to kill it. If this is true then that story can become, in some form, a *MotW* mystery. And fortunately there is no more common or celebrated type of story in human [[history]].

Take *Beowulf* for example. I was forced to read it in college under duress. Underneath all that Anglo-Saxon gibberish (or timeless poetry) is a [[Cool]] story about a monster (descended from the biblical Cain) who likes to break up noisy parties by eating people. He could only be killed by somebody with their bare hands.

Now let’s expand on that great idea. *Grimm* had an episode about a [[monsters]]’ fight club didn’t it? How about a secret illegal fight club where people come to stab and shoot our friend Grendel for sadistic kicks? A mission idea begins to form: it’s a bit like saving Wolverine from the combat bar in the first *X-Men* film. Perhaps our intrepid hunters’ mission is to befriend him or defeat him so they can find out the secret information he discovered while working for a Big Bad who will feature in our next adventure. It is very doable as a mystery: you just need some stats for Grendel, special rules on Grendel wrestling and maybe befriending him, and then maybe jot down some ideas on letting him join the team as a “monstrous” addition if your hunters need some muscle.

There are so [[many]] monster hunting shows, comic books, miniseries, and mythological short stories that you can literally find them everywhere. The trick is to make that story your own mystery.

I recently sent my valorous hunters off to the Frozen North to battle arctic demons awakened by climate change. These spirits intend to stem the ecological destruction by murdering the various human intruders responsible for global warming in the Canadian Arctic. This was great fun. Soon my players were desperately trying to dodge various strange and icy demons and bizarre polar creatures along with dealing with a climate just as merciless.

How did I brilliantly design my little epic? I was directly inspired by *The Barsoom Project* by Larry Niven and Steve Barnes. In the novel the characters are playing in a futuristic LARP: an adventure where an evil shaman is freezing the planet. I had global warming awaken a powerful spirit from her icy naptime.

Reading about the Canadian North soon leads me to learn about the Lost Franklin expedition and the recent discovery of the expedition ships Erebus and Terror. With confirmed evidence of cannibalism among some of the expedition’s last victims you just know there is a ghoulish mystery there. A celebrity acquaintance of mine, Jared Harris, will be starring (to my shock) in a monster hunting thriller for AMC, based on Dan Simmons’ novel *The Terror,* which was based on the Franklin Expedition, so I have to throw an adaption of that in the mix. Also: with the Vikings making their forays into Canada in historical times, I just have to tie in a Norse monster somewhere. Suddenly I’m up to my highballs with monster and mystery ideas without really trying.

[[Monsters]] and monster hunting are everywhere in popular culture, my dear Virginia. And always remember, my dear Virginia: [[whatever]] you believe, the [[monsters]] believe in you.

Keep the lights on!
