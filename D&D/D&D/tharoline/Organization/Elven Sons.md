#### Notes

- The worship of The [[Elven Sons]] goes back to the very first inhabitants of Tharoline. According to its legends, the elven god [[Krenos]]  who created Tharoline, gifted the world to his three sons after his lover left him. [[Ilios]]   the wise was given the west, [[Aeredon]]  the strong was given the east, and Ruthos the wicked was given the center. The three brothers each created their own peoples to fill the land, and honor them with great deads. [[Ruthos]]  grew hungry for power though and sent his children out to destroy the others, so he could claim all of Tharoline as their own. Displeased by this, Eradon and [[Ilios]]  pleaded with their father to help, so using the last of his life force, [[Krenos]]  banished [[Ruthos]]  to the darkest depths of the world, where it is said he awaits the day he can return and take revenge on his brothers.
- The [[Elven Sons]]   are primarily worshiped in Meijing where the old traditions are upheld, and the elves of [[Tharoline]]  can worship their gods without fear of persecution. To the non-elves who worship the elven sons, elves are viewed as demigods, direct decendants of the sons themselves, causing them to be treated with utmost respects in the places where the religion is still practiced.
