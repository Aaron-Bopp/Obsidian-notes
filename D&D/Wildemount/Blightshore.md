The blackened seaboard that forms the easternmost edge of Wildemount is a savage wasteland struggling to recover from the arcane havoc wrought by the Calamity so many years ago. The Miskath Strand was once a temperate expanse of arboreal pulchritude and coastal tranquility, but it has since become a lonely stretch of hazardous terrain and maddening isolation. This coastline of cursed earth and the surrounding area have come to be known as Blightshore, a fitting moniker for the once-proud seaside paradise defiled by the Betrayer Gods. Here, among the Miskath Strand's smoldering remains, explorers vie for the opportunities offered up by Blightshore's weird new varieties of flora and fauna—not to mention the hidden wealth that lurks within the lightless vaults of the Betrayers themselves. Life in Blightshore is difficult at best; for many, it represents a true test of spirit as they weather the persistent chaos of Blightshore's terrain.

While the Dwendalian Empire and its constituents seek to establish a foothold in the more hospitable regions of the Miskath Strand, these efforts are consistently hampered by Blightshore's less scrupulous denizens. Remote operatives of the Myriad and the Revelry, intrepid pilgrims from the Kryn Dynasty, outcasts from the fallen city of Draconia, and goblinoid nomads from the Xhorhasian wastes form the motley civilization of Blightshore. Moreover, this land is home to many undead horrors and wandering hollow ones (see [chapter 4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/character-options#HollowOne "chapter 4")).

Map 3.10: Blightshore

### Bizarre Terrain of Blightshore

The strange landscape of the Miskath Strand has been savagely reshaped by the Calamity, infusing the earth with chaotic new elements and especially inhospitable terrain. As a result, much of this region of Eastern Wynandir remains relatively unmapped by modern scholars.

The terrain and weather features described in the sections that follow can be encountered anywhere within Blightshore's defiled expanse. Many of these areas present hazardous (and potentially fatal) conditions for travelers and explorers. As your players traverse the desolate badlands of the Miskath Strand, you can present Blightshore's weird and wondrous terrain as a character in its own right. And perhaps there are even stranger features of this accursed frontier that wait to be discovered, tamed, or avoided at all costs.

These chunks of broken land hover and swirl in the air, held aloft by unknown arcane forces. A typical earth mote is 1d6 × 10 feet in diameter and hovers 2d10 × 10 feet above the ground. Earth motes are capable of supporting the weight of modest structures as well as creatures.

The galvanic breezes of this supernatural gale are latticed with currents of lightning, which stab through the air with primordial fury.

-   Ranged attacks through electric wind are made with disadvantage.
-   Any creature that starts its turn surrounded by electric wind has a 5 percent chance of being struck by lightning. A creature struck by lightning must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A dense grove of blackened, leafless trees perpetually smolders with the dull glow of arcane embers. This copse is choked by a cloud of ash and cinders, which constantly rain on the cremated forest floor.

-   An ember thicket is a lightly obscured area.
-   Creatures gain one level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion) for every 10 minutes spent inside an ember thicket without suitable protection from the heat, smoke, and ash.
-   Ranged attacks through an ember thicket are made with disadvantage. A ranged weapon attack made through or within an ember thicket automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range.

An etheric rift appears as a light fog or spectral haze. The interplanar tracts of this anomaly reach in and out of the Border Ethereal. Unseen trenches and invisible paths overlap throughout its vaporous expanse.

-   An etheric rift is a lightly obscured area.
-   Any creature that enters an etheric rift or starts its turn there has a 33 percent chance of gaining the effect of the [etherealness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/etherealness) spell until the end of its next turn.

This cylindrical area is affected by the unseen pull of heightened gravitational force. A typical gravity funnel is 3d10 × 10 feet tall and 5d10 × 10 feet in diameter.

-   Strength checks made within a gravity funnel have disadvantage.
-   A ranged weapon attack made through or within a gravity funnel automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range.
-   Creatures and objects that are fully contained within a gravity funnel have resistance against force damage.
-   The gravity funnel counts as difficult terrain.

A virtually imperceptible mist of preternatural psychotropic vapor hovers above the ground. This coruscating miasma corrupts the sanity of the living and fortifies the grim resolve of the undead.

-   Creatures that are fully immersed in psychic miasma have vulnerability to psychic damage.
-   Any creature that enters a cloud of psychic miasma or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "[Madness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness "Madness")" in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master's Guide")). Creatures that can't be [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that successfully saves against the psychic miasma is immune to its effects for 24 hours.
-   An undead creature that spends at least 1 minute in a cloud of psychic miasma gains advantage on ability checks and saving throws for 24 hours.

This crimson precipitation is corrosive to ferrous metal and caustic to creatures.

-   Rust rain corrodes nonmagical, ferrous metal objects. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the rain destroys 1 cubic foot of it for every 10 minutes of exposure. An object must be covered to avoid exposure. If the exposed object is nonmagical metal armor, a nonmagical metal weapon, or a nonmagical metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls or the AC it offers for every 10 minutes of exposure to rust rain. A weapon that drops to a −5 penalty, armor reduced to an AC of 10, or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.
-   Any creature that starts it turn in rust rain and isn't covered by an umbrella, a shield, or some other form of rain protection takes 1d4 acid damage.

A virulent expanse of malignant fungal growths blankets the landscape and fills the air above it with spores.

-   Any non-plant creature within 20 feet of a toxic fungus colony is [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned). A creature [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) by the colony for 1 hour has a 20 percent chance of gaining a random form of short-term madness (see "[Madness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness "Madness")" in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")).
-   A toxic fungus colony can be bioluminescent. A bioluminescent colony sheds dim light within its area and for an additional 20 feet beyond its outer edges.

The arcane fallout from the Calamity is so widespread throughout Blightshore that the very land, sea, and air have been subtly altered in strange and mysterious ways. As characters explore the post-Calamity Miskath Strand, roll on the Uncanny Phenomena table as frequently as you like to augment the world they encounter. If you roll something that doesn't make sense, roll again, choose a more appropriate entry, or use the result as inspiration to make up your own phenomenon. The magical effects of these phenomena can't be dispelled.

d10

Phenomenon

1

It smells of death here. This area is permanently ridden with the stench of rot and decay.

2

Incorporeal phantoms move in and out of reality here. These apparitions ignore any interaction with creatures.

3

Everything is a single color here. All physical matter in this area adopts the pigmentation of one of the seven colors of the rainbow or the color black.

4

Nonmagical fire can't burn here.

5

Sources of light here appear kaleidoscopic. Empty air refracts light in this area, creating dazzling displays of prismatic colors.

6

Any character who sleeps here dreams of a different life on a different world in a different body.

7

There is no sound here. This area is permanently under the effects of the [silence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/silence) spell.

8

This place is supernaturally unlucky. Attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws cannot be rerolled in this area.

9

Water turns to acid here. Water introduced to this area becomes acid in 1d4 days.

10

This place is haunted by fragments of the Far Realm. Whenever the target of a Wisdom saving throw fails its save, that creature has a 5 percent chance of becoming afflicted by a random form of long-term madness (see "[Madness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness "Madness")" in chapter 8 of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master's Guide")).

### Cauldron Sea

A perpetual storm chokes the stony shores of this dark and brackish expanse, where aspects of the Elemental Plane of Water and the Abyss collide in constant entropic turmoil. Aquatic terrors lurk in its murky fathoms, which are rumored to hold everything from the ruined battlements of a sunken city to the haunted graveyard of a forgotten fleet.

Although the waters of the Cauldron Sea present challenges to those who would tame its tides, a handful of unmapped (and often unnamed) villages are scattered along its savage shores. Some of these settlements offer safe havens to weary travelers of the northern Strand, prospectors and pirates alike, but most treat outsiders with disdain or even outright hostility.

Soothsayers claim that Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, created the Cauldron Sea to loosen the veil between worlds and warn that one day he will rend the very fabric of reality from the depths of its accursed waters. There are those who would see this mad prophecy fulfilled, but many more would do anything to prevent the Betrayer God's malevolent return.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-25.png)

Cauldron Sea

The tumultuous waters of the Cauldron Sea breed all manner of creatures and crises for intrepid characters to overcome.

_**Presage in a Bottle (Mid Level).**_ Unlike the restorative essences of the Sorrowseep Waters, a draught of liquid from the Cauldron Sea is said to induce madness along with various other arcane effects. A world-class alchemist and chirurgeon, the eccentric Brannon Ven Brava, seeks to analyze the primordial liquid's supernatural essence firsthand and will pay handsomely for an escort through the wilds of Blightshore to secure it.

### Ebonglass Massif

The sharp obsidian peaks of the Ebonglass Massif spell doom to those who would attempt to tame them, but many still try. This jagged range of lustrous volcanic rock divides northeastern Blightshore into two large peninsulas: Far Hharom to the north, and the Tooth of Zehir to the east. Expeditions to the Ebonglass Massif from the nations of Western Wynandir and beyond have been fraught with peril, and the craggy mountains are considered all but impassable by cautious outlanders, curious prospectors, and others who would explore their mysteries.

Like many places in the Miskath Strand, the Massif is haunted by a dark past. Historians have unearthed tales of ancient dwarven strongholds that were utterly destroyed by the upheaval during the Calamity. Now, the only known denizens of the Ebonglass Massif are the birds of prey that scour its peaks for sustenance and a maniacal clan of gray-scaled kobolds that employs simple technology—hooks, cables, and gliders—to traverse the Massif's treacherous terrain.

The kobolds of the Massif live in a subterranean sprawl on the southwestern edge of the Ebonglass foothills. Known as the Fangs of the Worm, they are led by a kobold queen whose eldritch magic is sustained by the clan's central religious totem—a powerful artifact from ancient Eiselcross, which has no doubt played a large part in the wayward sect's rapid evolution and questionable sanity. The kobolds of the Fangs of the Worm gather around this massive cylinder of metal and light to pay fealty to their queen and honor the visions she receives from beyond. This columnar artifact is actually a cryogenic containment unit that houses and preserves a fetid tissue sample from the festering body of Quajath, the Undermaw, and what the kobolds of the Ebonglass Massif mistake for divine visions are actually the abhorrent murmurs of Quajath, who telepathically guides the clan's erratic actions.

The dwarves of the Ebonglass Massif persist as incorporeal caretakers in their hidden subterranean halls, where they carve the volcanic glass with psionic powers like an artist moves paint on canvas. These forlorn specters preside over an empire of impeccable craft and staggering natural wealth, but their physical tombs have no entrances from the outside world, much to the chagrin of would-be burglars.

Adventurers who find themselves near the peaks of the Ebonglass Massif have strayed very far indeed from the political turmoil of Wildemount. The nigh impassable mountains hide strange creatures and even stranger secrets.

_**Lost Xagonstar (Low Level).**_ The adventurers travel to Ebonglass Massif by airship to join a well-funded archaeological expedition mounted by Duurek Kronst, a wealthy dwarf who is determined to find the dwarven stronghold of Xagonstar, lost and buried since the Calamity. An unnatural storm sweeping across Blightshore causes the airship to crash, but the characters survive. Once they reach the dig site, they see that great progress has already been made. The first great hall of Xagonstar has been discovered! Unfortunately, the archaeologists are missing and the site has been abandoned. Were the diggers captured by the Fang of the Worm or carried off by a hungry [gloomstalker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gloomstalker) (as described in [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#Gloomstalker "chapter 7")), or did something slip out of Xagonstar to devour them?

### Far Hharom

Beyond the Ebonglass Massif's hyaline peaks, a lonely expanse of moorland stretches northward toward the icy waters of the Frigid Depths. Though the landscape is drab and featureless, the peninsula known as Far Hharom is littered with the barrows of a long-forgotten barbarian people, who vanished centuries before the Calamity ravaged the Miskath Strand. Here and there, gelid bogs home to bizarre flora and fauna dot the landscape. And all around, an obstinate air of doom lingers among the peninsula's perpetual howling winds.

Far Hharom is a dangerous realm, even by Blightshore's standards, and many suggest that the impasse formed by the Ebonglass Massif is actually a blessing in disguise. The only charted settlement in Far Hharom is an abandoned village on the rocky island west of the peninsula, known as Olc Skerry (described later in this chapter). Travelers have been known to camp amid the stony ruins—but these interlopers leave as soon as their affairs allow, typically preferring the haunted expanse of Far Hharom's open fells over the eerie isolation of Olc Skerry's craggy shores.

The ancient burial mounds scattered across Far Hharom are rumored to be haunted by restless undead that were animated just as the arcane meddling of the Betrayer Gods reached its abominable zenith. Though the antiquities buried within Far Hharom's ancient barrows promise considerable wealth to those who would plunder their lightless depths, few excavators of these accursed places actually live to tell the tale.

#### Domains of the Deep Ones

There are rumors of a frightening clan of amphibious humanoids who dwell along the icy northern shores of Far Hharom. The stories speak of a hoary clan of pale, degenerate folk who pay fealty to dark, arctic demigods in the form of warm-blooded sacrifices. Some believe the Ebonglass Massif was erected by the Betrayer Gods to keep these strange and sinister people at bay, while others report to have seen raiding parties of scaly Far Hharom monstrosities as far south as the Cauldron Sea.

The northern peninsula of Blightshore is a remote and unwelcoming place, but characters in search of secret histories and treasured lore will find it most inviting.

_**Deep Ones of Far Hharom (Low Level).**_ A coastal storm causes the characters' ship to run aground on the northern shore of Far Hharom. As they take stock of the damage and make plans to head inland, waves of [kuo-toa](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kuo-toa) converge on the ship and attack them.

_**It Kills at Night (Mid Level).**_ While exploring a Far Hharom barrow, the characters are surprised to discover a group of spooked travelers who have taken shelter within. Instead of the subterranean wights and poltergeists of legend, these survivors fear an even greater threat that stalks the moorland at night—something so supernaturally horrible, they must huddle in darkness every evening to evade it as they wearily cross the accursed landscape.

### Ghor Veles

The ruined keep at the heart of this crumbling city once served as an arcane repository and research facility for the Betrayer Gods during their pre-Calamity ascent to power. Artifacts and wondrous items from the Age of Arcanum are rumored to linger within its shadow-haunted vaults, lying in wait for those brave or foolish enough to challenge the citadel's timeless guardians. Now, its decaying battlements stand as a stark monument to the Calamity's unstoppable devastation.

The name Ghor Veles means "Vault of Shadows," and a vast dungeon indeed lurks below the ruins of the city. These catacombs were home to the aberrant and undead minions of the dracolich Oracs the Enduring. Countless adventuring parties and would-be tomb robbers have attempted to lay siege to the vaults below Ghor Veles, only to perish at the clawed hands and creeping doom of the keep's fearsome inhabitants. But a destiny worse than death awaits them: most of these ill-fated interlopers become undead minions themselves, bound to Oracs in unending servitude. As this army grows, so does Oracs's hold over the Miskath Strand.

#### Land of Refugees and Hermits

Ghor Veles is pockmarked by crumbling houses and dilapidated fortresses, and countless people displaced from elsewhere in Xhorhas by war or exile have made this blighted battlefield their home. A notable resident of the ruins surrounding Ghor Veles is a dranassar survivor named Liv-Burrath. She uses magic to disguise herself as a dark elf to avoid attracting attention, but is covertly collecting arcane relics from Ghor Veles with the hope that she can one day reunite with other dranassar and retake their ancient home of Ghor Dranas. She pays a fair sum for any artifacts that adventurers gather from the ruins.

Only the undead horrors beneath Ghor Veles rival the cutthroat grave robbers that characters might encounter among the crumbling ruins.

_**Shadow Essence (Mid Level).**_ The characters are hired by Cerberus Assembly sages in New Haxon to gather a rare magical ingredient—shadow essence—that can be collected from dead [gloomstalkers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gloomstalker) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#Gloomstalker "chapter 7")). As gloomstalkers are known to circle above Ghor Veles like vultures, the sages ask the characters to travel there, slay a gloomstalker, and collect its shadow essence in a specially made flask. The sages warn the characters not to linger near Ghor Veles, lest they fall prey to the terrible creatures lurking in its haunted fortress.

_**Of Vaults and Vengeance (High Level).**_ One or more of the characters are kidnapped by minions of [Oracs the Enduring](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/oracs-the-enduring) (chaotic evil, male, ancient black dracolich) and are carried away to the vaults below Ghor Veles for indoctrination and necromantic experimentation. With the help of a [core spawn seer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/core-spawn-seer) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#CoreSpawnSeer "chapter 7")) from the Miskath Pit, the dracolich and his minions are weaponizing their mortal enemies to gruesome effect. As one half of the party struggles to survive captivity, the rest of the characters must plot their harrowing rescue.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-26.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-26.png)

Ghor Veles

### Incanter's Rest

This Calamity-era battlefield is now a massive graveyard haunted by the undead spirits of unnameable horrors and their cruel, unending vengeance. Named after the unknown mage who brought this region's struggle to its devastating conclusion, Incanter's Rest has few landmarks other than the gigantic skeletal remains of three monstrous titans, which reverently tower above the area's dusty steppes. Howling winds perpetually sweep the Rest with ghostly ardor, while ramshackle monuments of rusted weapons and armor sporadically mark the graves of the fallen.

Some historians speculate that Incanter's Rest is actually the amalgamated site of multiple conflicts, while others claim that it was the most massive battlefield Wildemount has ever seen. No matter the cause, the grave-strewn fields of Incanter's Rest are seeded with powerful necromantic energies that many unscrupulous mages seek to exploit.

### Miskath Pit

This geographical anomaly is an arcane sinkhole of unknown depth and origin. Its oblong opening measures roughly 120 feet in diameter and plunges endlessly into the planet's surface. Few survivors have returned from the pit's staggering subterranean expanse, and those who have appear maddened and deranged with fear. Whatever precipitated the advent of the pit is ultimately inconsequential compared to the sheer devastation it causes in the surrounding Blightshore wilds.

Despite its astounding depth, the Miskath Pit's twisting tunnels are far from lightless. A melange of psychedelic sights and sounds are found throughout its bizarre subterranean landscapes, where strange, sporadic lights can be just as terrifying as the darkness. The cloying presence of something ancient and evil is unmistakable to anyone who seeks firsthand to understand the pit's harrowing phenomena. This area is an appalling fusion of the Underdark and the alien quasi-geometries of the Far Realm.

Travelers have recently reported sightings of a new variety of horrific aberrations in the vicinity of the Miskath Pit. Known as core spawn, these creatures embody the chaotic nature of Blightshore itself with every tenebrous fiber of their eldritch being. Hordes of lesser core spawn are presided over by core spawn seers—corrupted magic users whose loathsome agendas are one of Blightshore's greatest (and most troubling) mysteries. See [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#CoreSpawn "chapter 7") for more information about core spawn.

Despite its unique perils, the Miskath Pit is a darkly alluring place that seems to beckon travelers with a proclivity for eldritch magic or a taste for trouble. The bizarre arcane phenomena that plague the Miskath Pit are also responsible for an array of enchanted minerals and precious elements. Profiteers from Rotthold and beyond risk madness, and even death, in an attempt to mine the pit's supernatural resources.

### New Haxon

**Population:** 1,250 (70% humans, 20% dragonborn, 10% other races)

**Government:** The Cerberus Assembly works in tandem with allied mercenaries to maintain a stratocracy of lawful military power.

**Defense:** Satyana Vorvexis, an adult copper dragon, commands a garrison of over two hundred active duty soldiers, and each citizen of New Haxon is enlisted for reserve military duty.

**Commerce:** Common goods and services are available via the city's vast network of enterprising military merchants. Meanwhile, the Cerberus Assembly strives to subvert New Haxon's thriving and profitable black market for rare arcane antiquities.

**Organizations:** Although the Cerberus Assembly's sages hold power here, various mercenary guilds from remote corners of Wildemount have also made New Haxon their base of operations. The city has become an unlikely haven for esoteric cults of the Betrayer Gods and other dark entities.

Whatever disaster befell Old Haxon is a tale lost to time and the Calamity. In its place, a fair-weather confederation of humans and dragonborn have erected this lone bastion. The stalwart outpost of New Haxon is garrisoned by agents of the Cerberus Assembly, along with a contingent of allied mercenaries from nearby Draconia. An amalgam of crumbling ruins and modern battlements, New Haxon serves as the Dwendalian Empire's only trusted waypoint for "civilized" exploration throughout Blightshore's savage badlands.

The adult copper dragon Satyana Vorvexis commands New Haxon's threadbare legion of soldiers with a healthy measure of cunning and inventiveness. In addition to her military prowess, Satyana's draconic predilections and experience in the field have earned her a reputation as one of Wynandir's foremost curators and collectors of arcane relics. Some members of the assembly (and their imperial patrons) question the chaotic dragon's true intentions, but the people of New Haxon would be hard pressed to find a more competent leader to navigate the region's tumultuous history and enduring threats.

Among its other mysteries, Old Haxon is rumored to be the site of one of the lost vaults of Vecna, where the lich hid countless magic items of awesome power and ill intent. Whether or not this arcane storehouse is merely the stuff of legend remains to be seen, but its presence would certainly explain the Cerberus Assembly's keen interest in Haxon's wayward history.

Characters who adventure in New Haxon are likely conscripts, volunteers, or opponents of the local stratocracy's oppressive military force.

_**Right Side of Wrong (Low Level).**_ As dutiful servants of the Cerberus Assembly, the characters are tasked with ridding a local safe house of cult activity. But the operation doesn't go according to plan: one of the [cultists](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cultist) is the teenage son of a prominent assembly official, and the characters must decide whether they will shine a light on his indiscretion or bury it at the potential cost of becoming accomplices themselves.

_**Plunder the Crypt (Mid Level).**_ A high elf mastermind, Drahir Baiegn, hires the characters to masquerade as Cerberus Assembly agents and plunder a notorious vault below New Haxon: the Amethyst Crypt. When they infiltrate the vault, however, the characters discover they've been duped by Baiegn, who sacrifices his disposable agents to feed an abhorrent arcane construct deep within the inescapable tomb.

_**Eater of Worlds (High Level).**_ The characters are summoned to a meeting with Satyana Vorvexis. One of the dragon's spies managed to infiltrate a cult operating within the city and determined that its leaders are preparing a ritual to summon Shothotugg, the Eater of Worlds (see the "[Elder Evils of Exandria](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary/#sidebarElderEvilsOfExandria "Elder Evils of Exandria")" sidebar in chapter 7). Shothotugg's arrival would almost certainly place New Haxon in jeopardy. The cult controls a crumbling dungeon complex below the ruins of Old Haxon. The cult's leaders are a pair of [vampires](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire) aided by a small conclave of [cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cloaker), but most of the cult members are nihilistic humanoids and [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn).

### Olc Skerry

Legends say the people of Olc Skerry were either slaughtered by outlanders or claimed by a virulent contagion. Learned sages, however, suggest that the inhabitants of this island hamlet abandoned it long ago and journeyed into the mainlands of the Far Hharom peninsula. The nature of this exodus remains a mystery, but relics found scattered among Olc Skerry's crumbling wooden hovels and tenebrous seaside caves suggest the people of the village revered an unnamed pantheon of forgotten entities from the Far Realm. Modern explorers who return from expeditions to Olc Skerry tell stories of pernicious phantoms who poison the mind with madness, and blood-hungry wolves that lurk among the island's dark and craggy woodlands.

Olc Skerry is a spooky, abandoned settlement sure to raise the hackles of even the most jaded explorer.

_**Ol' Bucket Helm (Low Level).**_ Flocks of black gulls haunt the lonely north shores of the island, congregating around a seaside cave that attracts ordinary crabs and a few giant crabs as well. Just outside the cave mouth, someone has planted a grim scarecrow with a rusted bucket helm for a head, and anyone who tampers with the helm causes the black gulls to form into three hostile swarms (use the [swarm of ravens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-ravens) stat block in appendix A of the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual")). The gulls also gather into swarms at the command of the cave's reclusive occupant, Peggy Silva, a sea hag with snails in her hair who wears an old fishing net as a shawl. A deranged kuo-toa whip named Plookoolp is the only company Peggy Silva tolerates.

_**Black Sap (Mid Level).**_ Visitors to Olc Skerry can't help but notice an old stone windmill perched atop a rocky hill just south of town, its four spindly vanes stripped to their wooden bones. Behind the crumbling, desolate structure grows a large death's head willow, from which characters can extract 20 doses of black sap (see the "[Blightshore Contraband](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-blightshore#BlightshoreContraband "Blightshore Contraband")" sidebar earlier in this chapter). The black sap is worth a small fortune in the black markets of Rotthold. However, the windmill is home to an oni that doesn't take kindly to the sap's theft.

### Rotthold

**Population:** 8,800 (30% humans, 15% dark elves, 15% goblins, 15% tieflings, 5% hollow ones, 20% other races)

**Government:** Rotthold has no official governing body but is held together by a consortium of local guild leaders, merchants, and veteran adventurers who meet in secret once a week to discuss current affairs, shared interests, and potential threats.

**Defense:** The small but precious amount of sanctuary Rotthold provides from the Blightshore wastes is upheld by a militia of battle-hardened locals and dutifully concerned citizens. Other fortune-seekers often join this militia simply for the opportunities and information the alliance provides.

**Commerce:** Almost anything can be bought or sold in Rotthold, where the merchants are just as unscrupulous as in the surrounding Blightshore wilderness. Rotthold is the center of black market trade in Eastern Wynandir, and perhaps in all of Wildemount.

**Organizations:** In addition to the city's handful of merchants and thieves' guilds, a confederacy of agents representing the mercantile interests of the Myriad and the Revelry operate in public throughout Rotthold, while a covert sect of the Cerberus Assembly carries out their own clandestine business.

Some say this lawless harbor city is as dangerous as the arcane wilds of Blightshore that surround it. But whether or not visitors enjoy its chaotic disposition, Rotthold is an unmistakable center of travel and commerce in eastern Wildemount. The decayed stone dwellings and wooden tenements that line Rotthold's ramshackle streets are enveloped by a luminous, rust-colored moss that bathes the city's evenings in a sick crimson glow. Many outlanders view this crime-ridden settlement as little more than a collection of degenerate safe houses and slums, while others see it as a raw jewel—full of potential—that shines bright among the dusky shadows of the poisoned east.

Multiple factions operate in and around Rotthold, including covert agents of the Cerberus Assembly and a tenuous coalition between members of the Myriad and the Revelry. While the Plank King's remote forces maintain the southern waterways and oversee the export of Blightshore's esoteric resources, Myriad spies monitor and manipulate the exchange of goods and services inside the city limits, and the fragile alliance between these two is the closest thing this unruly corner of the Miskath Strand has to a governing body.

The open trade of illicit goods and services is the lifeblood of Rotthold's mossy streets. All manner of pleasures are available for those willing enough to pay the price, which can be quite steep. Many of Rotthold's denizens owe the Myriad one favor or another, and the constant exchange of these debts keeps the city full of new faces. Crime is a way of life in Rotthold, where the Dwendalian Empire and Kryn Dynasty have no sway over its opportunistic, unethical inhabitants.

No walls protect Rotthold from the surrounding Blightshore wastes, but eleven watchtowers serve as a line of defense. The city is roughly divided into four quarters: North Rotthold, East Rotthold, Dockside, and Cairn Hill. North Rotthold houses the city's most impoverished denizens, who encounter the Miskath Strand's impinging monstrous wildlife on a regular basis. Most of the city's trade is conducted in East Rotthold, where a bazaar known as the Red Market takes up a majority of the quarter. On the south side of the city, Dockside is the purview of the Revelry and houses Rotthold's most affluent citizens, who no doubt believe they are safest when located as far away from Blightshore's savage interior as possible. On the west end of the city, the quarter known as Cairn Hill rests above a mysterious lattice of pre-Calamity catacombs. Here in Rotthold's graveyard, furtive agents meet in cemeteries to carry out their agendas.

The moss-lit streets of Rotthold are ripe with adventure for characters with a taste for small-city mystery or black market mayhem.

_**Rough Times in Rotthold (Low Level).**_ A moment of respite goes south in one of North Rotthold's taverns, where the characters—along with the proprietors and other patrons—become targets of an impromptu shakedown by an upstart gang with ties to a prominent thieves' guild. Successfully thwarting the [thugs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thug) could very well earn the characters the ire (or the respect) of the guild, which operates under the clandestine guidance of a mysterious cabal of enlightened [nothics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/nothic).

_**The Cairn Hill Horror (Mid Level).**_ A serial killer [cultist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cultist) stalks the streets of western Rotthold from his catacomb lair beneath Cairn Hill, where the viscera of a hundred victims have been offered to summon his otherworldly patron: a [glabrezu](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/glabrezu) named Vrath. This demon is a cruel, immortal deceiver that promises its [acolytes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/acolyte) unrivaled power in the wake of its awful arrival—and only the characters can stop it.

_**The Krakenwhacker (High Level).**_ Captain Veluna Samarshan of the galley _Krakenwhacker_ has decided to retire in Rotthold. Having heard about the adventurers' exploits, she offers to sell the _Krakenwhacker_ to them for one gold piece, though they'll need to find their own crew. The ship is in excellent condition and has a magical figurehead carved in the likeness of Bahamut that grants the vessel immunity to fire, lightning, and thunder damage. The ship is the envy of several other Revelry captains, and the characters might have to fend off their advances to keep it. Captain Samarshan also warns them about an [adult bronze dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-bronze-dragon) named Walarkus. Corrupted by the magic of Blightshore, this once-noble dragon has become a coastal menace consumed by greed. It would like nothing more than to add the ship's magical figurehead to its undersea trove.

Chapter 5 of the [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master's Guide") has rules and statistics for ships, as well as information about hiring a crew and making ship repairs.

### Tooth of Zehir

This eastern arm of Blightshore is a mist-shrouded peninsula, the northernmost swath of which is covered by the stone forest of Strathfell (described below).

The lower region of the Tooth is marked by craggy basalt beaches covered in black sand, and the ocean is full of hazardous, fossilized coral reefs. Exotic fey creatures are said to congregate among the Tooth's darker dominions, which are rumored to skirt the Shadowfell via the Border Ethereal.

This petrified woodland is the domain of an ancient silver shadow dragon named [Karkethzerethzerus, the Sable Despoiler](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/karkethzerethzerus-the-sable-despoiler) (Karketh for short). Before his malign reign, this region of the Miskath Strand was a verdant haven for a long-lost nation of wood elves and centaurs. For reasons unknown, Karkethzerethzerus plotted to annihilate the woodland nation, killing it off with energies from the Shadowfell. Since doing exactly that, the Sable Despoiler has ruled Strathfell with equal measures of gleeful arrogance and baleful suspicion. The shadow dragon's lair, like his motives, remain hidden. Etheric rifts run throughout Strathfell's gloomy expanse, allowing denizens such as darklings and meenlocks to travel to and from the Shadowfell with unsettling regularity. Most of these interplanar paths are invisible to the naked eye—but minions of Karkethzerethzerus know all too well where the veil grows thin.

The future of Strathfell is not without hope, for good-aligned centaurs continue to patrol the woods as their ancestors did in ages past, battling the evil forces of the shadow dragon at every turn. The centaurs could use some help, however, as they are few in number.

The southern tip of the peninsula abuts the Mordant Isle, a smaller land mass separated from the mainland by the reef-laden waters of the Venom Strait. On this island, an aberrant enclave of winged serpentkin dwell within the ruins of Sariss, the Jade City, where they have erected foul monuments to the Cloaked Serpent himself. These abhorrent snake folk plot a terrible doom for denizens of the Miskath Strand from their horrid lairs. No warm-blooded creature has ever been to Sariss and survived—or so the story goes.
