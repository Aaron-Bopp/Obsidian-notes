An undead knight bequeathes its Acheron blade to a worthy tiefling adventurer,  
but every great treasure has its price

Since magic was first introduced to mortals in ages past, many have sought to channel the gifts of magic into implements of power. Master crafters and fine artisans have long worked with talented arcanists and divine acolytes to craft beautiful artifacts of protection, or to forge armaments of war. The most skilled archmages enchanted and assembled vast collections of mighty artifacts throughout the Age of Arcanum, most of which were scattered and lost in the conflicts of the Calamity.

Adventurers, archeologists, and unscrupulous explorers delve into dungeons, ruins, and forgotten places of lore in hopes of recovering these objects of power, even as spellcasters and researchers seek to replicate ancient enchantments by their own hands. This chapter contains a collection of new magic items and artifacts found in Wildemount, but which can be used in any campaign setting.

Whether found in a subterranean tomb while searching for lost treasure, chosen as a reward from a wealthy collector of curiosities, or stumbled across as a discarded object of hidden potential, magic items are always highly sought after by adventurers in a Wildemount campaign. Relics of magic provide a perfect opportunity to bring alive the history of ages long gone, and to reward players for diligently seeking their way in the world.

Many of the magic items in this section are relics of the flying city-state of Aeor, and can often be found in Aeorian ruins in Eiselcross. See [chapter 3](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer "chapter 3") for more information on Eiselcross and Aeor.


These magic items are presented in alphabetical order. For the rules on magic items, see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItems "chapter 7") of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide").

**_Dark Blessing._** While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.

**_Disheartening Strike._** When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it’s immune to the [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) condition. Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until the next dusk.

Amulet of the Drunkard

### [Arcane Cannon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/arcane-cannon)

_Wondrous item, very rare_

This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn’t need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.

The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:

**Acid Jet.** The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.

**Fire Jet.** The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Frost Shot.** The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn’t reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Lightning Shot.** The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.

**Poison Spray.** The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned). A creature [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Poisoned) in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

While the radiant head is active, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and attacks with the weapon deal radiant damage instead of bludgeoning damage. An undead creature hit by the weapon takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

While you are holding [Duskcrusher](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/duskcrusher) and its radiant head is active, you can use an action to cast the [sunbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sunbeam) spell (save DC 15) from the weapon, and this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-04.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-04.png)

### [Luxon Beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon)

_Wondrous item, legendary_

This dodecahedron of faintly glowing crystal is heavier than it appears. A set of handles are affixed to its sides, and it pulsates and thrums when touched.

**_Fragment of Possibility._** A creature that touches the beacon and concentrates for 1 minute receives a Fragment of Possibility, which looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows the creature around, staying within 1 foot of it at all times. The fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used. Once the beacon grants a Fragment of Possibility, it can’t grant another until the next dawn. A creature with a Fragment of Possibility from a [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) can’t gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.

When a creature with a Fragment of Possibility makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it can expend its fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can expend its fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls its d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-05.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-05.png)

### [Potion of Possibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-possibility)

_Potion, very rare_

The creature takes 2d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### [Spell Bottle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-bottle)

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.

When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.

While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.

[![](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-07.png)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/06-07.png)

If you’re holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle.

### [Staff of Dunamancy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-dunamancy)

_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)_

This staff of polished gray wood bears numerous runes carved along its length. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into dust and is destroyed.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [fortune’s favor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fortunes-favor) (2 charges), [pulse wave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pulse-wave) (3 charges), or [gravity sinkhole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gravity-sinkhole) (4 charges).

## Vestiges of Divergence

When the great wars of the Calamity rolled across Exandria, heroes of divinity accepted legendary relics from their patrons and gods. At the same time, archmages wove dangerous arcane power into items of immense magical might. When the war ended, most of these magic items were buried with their wielders beneath ash and dust. Those items that survived were passed down as heirlooms and prized tokens of the past. Whether they survived destruction or have been claimed from the ruins of history, these remnants of a lost era have come to be known as the Vestiges of Divergence.

Each Vestige of Divergence is a magic item that evolves with its wielder. If not attuned to a worthy individual over a prolonged period, such items commonly revert to their **dormant state**. While in this state, a Vestige of Divergence grants an attuned bearer only some of its power. Over time, and in response to perseverance and personal growth, a Vestige of Divergence might unlock facets of its lost capabilities to enter an **awakened state**. Eventually, through extreme personal challenge, evolution, and achievement, these artifacts can reach their ultimate potential in their **exalted state**. The properties and features gained at each new state are cumulative with the properties and features granted at a previous state, unless otherwise noted.

This section presents a number of Vestiges of Divergence that might be found anywhere in Exandria. When Vestiges of Divergence are used in a campaign, their discovery and acquisition should always be treated with a suitable amount of weight and responsibility.

### [Danoth’s Visor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/danoths-visor)

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

## Arms of the Betrayers

The Arms of the Betrayers are sentient weapons forged from the souls of fiends by the Betrayer Gods for their humanoid champions. (See “[Lesser Idols](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-wildemount#LesserIdols "Lesser Idols")” in chapter 1 for more details.) These artifacts are more than just magic items. They are powerful sentient beings, filled with fury and eager to be wielded—and to spill blood.

### Betrayer Artifact Properties

The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence (see the previous section). In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See “[Artifact Properties](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#ArtifactProperties "Artifact Properties")” in chapter 7 of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide") for more information.

### Destroying These Artifacts

Destroying any of the Arms of the Betrayers is no easy task. Most conventional means of destruction fail to even scratch one of these ancient artifacts. Each weapon’s method of destruction is determined by the DM and should be unique and require at least one adventure to accomplish. The DM can choose or roll for a weapon’s method of destruction on the Arms of the Betrayers Destruction table, or use the table as inspiration.

When one of the Arms of the Betrayers is destroyed, the soul of the fiend within the weapon returns to its home plane—and begins to plot the destruction of the creatures responsible.

d8

Destruction Method

1

The weapon must be bathed in the ichor of an archdevil or demon lord.

2

A coven of twelve night hags must perform an eight-hour ritual known only to them on the plane of Gehenna to destroy the weapon.

3

The weapon must be brought back to a forgotten forge in Xhorhas and melted down by the furnace that made it.

4

The fiery breath of an ancient red dragon is the only thing that can destroy the weapon.

5

The weapon is destroyed if devoured by Uk’otoa.

6

Thrusting the weapon into a [Luxon beacon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/luxon-beacon) destroys the weapon and the beacon alike.

7

The weapon can be broken only by a blow from another of the Arms of the Betrayers.

8

Burning the remains of the first champion to wield the weapon destroys the item.

These artifacts are presented in alphabetical order. For the rules on artifacts, see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts "chapter 7") of the [Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide").
