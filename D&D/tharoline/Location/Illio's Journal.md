**Excerpts from [[Ilios]]’s Journal:**
“Today was the day. [[Tharolinia]] gave birth to a healthy baby girl. She’s very quiet for a baby. I don’t think I heard her fuss once while I was there. Remarkable. Even more remarkable is that she’s the first of her kind. Half-mortal, half-god. There’s so much about her left to discover. I’m hoping when she’s a little older father will let me run some experiments to see just what exactly she can do, but there will be time for that later. Today I just want to let them enjoy the moment. I don’t think I’ve ever seen either of them any happier. It’s wonderful.”

**Three Months Later**
“The worst has happened. [[Ruthos]] came today. A rift opened up in the center of the world, and he came out with the most horrific of his hellspawn spilling out after him. We quickly arrived with father to confront him, but by then the entire central region of the world was overrun. He said that the land promised to [[Amarei]] was rightfully his, and he had come to reclaim it. Father quickly reminded him that he had been disinherited. Of the evils that he brought into the world. [[Ruthos]] would not listen though, and told father that we have a week to meet his demands or there would be war. Father left before [[Aeredon]] and I could discuss the matter. It’s all a matter of waiting now. I asked [[Inarie]] if she could look ahead at what was to come. To give us some sort of insight as to what the future might hold. She spent an entire day in her chamber, and when she came out, she told me that no matter how far ahead she looked, all she saw was darkness.”

**One Week Later** 
“Father has hidden [[Amarei]] away. He wouldn’t tell us where, only that she was safe. It’s for the best. In two days, we go to war.”[[Tharolinia]] has been captured. [[Ruthos]]’s forces were somehow able to invade father’s palace and steal her away. We suspect that she’s now being kept somewhere in [[Ruthos]]’s fortress, though as things stand now we have no way of infiltrating it. But no matter how hard it seems now, we have to get her back. When [[Amarei]] awakens, she’ll need her mother there. For her sake, we have to do it.”

**Nine Months Later**
“It’s happened!  [[Aeredon]] and a group of our strongest warriors were able to make it into [[Ruthos]]’s fortress and rescue [[Tharolinia]]. They suffered many casualties though, including [[Oloran]]. [[Yersa]] is taking it hard. She’s closed herself off in the tapestry room, and isn’t taking visitors. I need her to pull through this. We’ve already lost [[Oloran]] and [[Leorus]]. I can’t lose anymore friends.”

**One Day Later**
“Even though we got [[Tharolinia]] back, I fear she may be beyond saving. [[Aeredon]] brought her to me today. She looked horrible and was rambling incoherently. After a quick examination of her, we were able to determine that [[Ruthos]] tortured her, filing her dreams with horrific nightmares every time she slept. From the sunken look her eyes, the deterioration of her skin, and the hallucinations and paranoia it seems as though she quit sleeping entirely. We’re going to do what we can for her but I don’t know how helpful it will be.”

**Two Weeks Later**
    “[[Tharolinia]] has died.”
