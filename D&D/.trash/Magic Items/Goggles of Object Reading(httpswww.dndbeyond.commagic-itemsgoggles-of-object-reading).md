### [Goggles of Object Reading](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/goggles-of-object-reading)

_Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.

In addition, you can cast the [identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/identify) spell using the googles. Once you do so, you canâ€™t do so again until the next dawn.
