### [Acheron Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/acheron-blade)

_Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)_

The black blade of this sword is crafted from a mysterious arcane alloy. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you are immune to effects that turn undead.

**_Dark Blessing._** While holding the sword, you can use an action to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.

**_Disheartening Strike._** When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can fill the target with unsettling dread: the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn. The creature ignores this effect if it’s immune to the [frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened) condition. Once you use this property, you can’t do so again until the next dusk.### [Acheron Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/acheron-blade)
