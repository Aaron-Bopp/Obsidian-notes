### [Breathing Bubble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/breathing-bubble)

_Wondrous item, common_

This translucent, bubble-like sphere has a slightly tacky outer surface, and you gain the itemâ€™s benefits only while wearing it over your head like a helmet.

The bubble contains 1 hour of breathable air. The bubble regains all its expended air daily at dawn.
