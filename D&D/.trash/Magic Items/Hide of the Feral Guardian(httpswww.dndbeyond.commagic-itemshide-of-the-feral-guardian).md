_Armor (studded leather), legendary (requires attunement)_

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melora, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

When the armor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:
