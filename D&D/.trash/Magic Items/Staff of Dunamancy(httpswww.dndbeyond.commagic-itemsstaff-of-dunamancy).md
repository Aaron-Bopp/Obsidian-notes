### [Staff of Dunamancy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/staff-of-dunamancy)

_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)_

This staff of polished gray wood bears numerous runes carved along its length. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into dust and is destroyed.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [fortune’s favor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fortunes-favor) (2 charges), [pulse wave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pulse-wave) (3 charges), or [gravity sinkhole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gravity-sinkhole) (4 charges). See [chapter 4](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/character-options-subclasses#DunamancySpells "chapter 4") for descriptions of these spells.

**_New Possibility._** If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against a spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
