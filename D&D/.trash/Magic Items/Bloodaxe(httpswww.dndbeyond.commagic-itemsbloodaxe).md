You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic axe. The axe deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to creatures that arenâ€™t constructs or undead. If you reduce such a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using this axe, you gain 10 temporary hit points.

This axe is forged from a dark, rust-colored metal and once belonged to the goliath barbarian Grog Strongjaw of Vox Machina.
