Gumshoe Code  
With the agreement of the Keeper, pick a one-sentence  
Code that your Gumshoe adheres to.  
Example Codes: Murders must be punished.  
Monsters must be destroyed. Innocents must  
be saved. Laws must be enforced. Evil must be  
exposed. The weak must be protected from the  
powerful.  
This Code defines your Gumshoe. Any time you  
violate your code you forfeit all Code related moves (The  
Postman Always Rings Twice, The Long Goodbye) and  
the ability to spend Luck points. These forfeits last either  
until the next mystery or you make amends. As long as  
you follow the Code people will sense your sincerity: you  
receive +1 ongoing for manipulate someone and you  
may not be possessed or charmed by any sort of supernatural, alien, or demonic entity or item.  
Moves  
You get three Gumshoe moves. You get these two:  
B Occult Confidential: The first time in each mystery  
that you observe a monster, minion, or phenomenon  
in action, you may ask one question from the investigate a mystery list.  
B The Naked City: You have lots of personal contacts wherever you go. Pick four contact types from  
the following areas (or from other areas agreed to  
between you and the Keeper):  
Academics, Accountants, Artists, Bartenders, Clergy,  
Conspiracy Theorists, Construction, Courts, Criminals  
(organised), Criminals (street), Cultists, Engineers, Espionage, Film and TV, Forensic Scientists, Fringe Scientists,  
Hackers, Journalists, Lawyers, Mechanics, Media, Medical  
Practioners, Military, Morgue, Occult, Police (local),  
Police (national), Politicians, Prisons, Private Security,  
Property Developers, Stage Magicians, Technologists,  
Transportation  
You can hit them up for info (+1 to one investigate  
a mystery roll) or small favours—but there may be  
a small cost involved. Personal contacts can provide  
more significant help but the Keeper decides their  
price on a case-by-case basis.  
Then pick one of these:  
b The Postman Always Rings Twice: Twice per  
mystery—as long as you follow your Code—you may  
reroll a roll.  
b The Long Goodbye: You can’t die with an open case.  
Specifically, you suffer all harm as normal but your  
death is postponed until you have either completed  
or abandoned the case, or you break your Code (then  
all bets are off).  
b Jessica Jones Entry: When you double-talk your  
way into a secure location, roll +Charm. On a 10+  
pick three, on a 7-9 pick two, on a fail pick one:  
• You don’t leave any trace of what you searched.  
• You find what you wanted.  
• You find something else that’s important.  
• You don’t piss anyone off.  
• You aren’t recognised.  
b Out of the Past: You have a police buddy who will do  
you big favors. Get in touch with them when you need  
to redirect law enforcement attention, get a heads-up  
on what operations are planned, or access police files.  
You now owe them: expect them to collect on it soon.  
b Asphalt Jungle: You heal faster than normal people.  
Any time your harm gets healed, heal an extra point.  
You are immune to all the harm move effects under  
‘0-harm’ and ‘1-harm’ (when the Keeper would apply  
these, you ignore it).  
b Hacker with a Dragon Tattoo: When you hack into  
a computer system, roll +Sharp. On 10+ pick two, on  
a 7-9 pick one. You:  
• ... leave no traces.  
• ... learn something important.  
• ... can leave misinformation in place.  
• ... gain access to somewhere you want to get in to.  
b “Just one more thing”: When you ask a suspect  
leading questions, roll +Charm. On a 10+ hold 2, on  
a 7-9 hold 1, on a miss hold 1 but something bad is  
going to happen too.  
Spend your hold to ask questions from this list:  
• One question from the investigate a mystery list.  
• Was that a lie?  
• What is something you left out that you didn’t want me  
to notice?  
• Are you complicit with any ongoing criminal activity?  
• Did you commit this specific crime?

close messy loud)  
b Switchblade (1-harm  
hand small)  
Introductions  
When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you  
can do your introductions together.  
Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your  
Gumshoe by name and look, and tell the group what they  
know about you.  
History  
Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for  
each of the other hunters:  
• You are on the same (or rival) bowling teams. Ask  
them what bowling-related disagreement rubbed  
them the wrong way.  
• You caught them committing a crime but let them  
go. Ask them to describe the crime, then you explain  
why your Code required you to look the other way.  
• They remind you of a former partner who was mysteriously murdered. Describe the unsolved case that  
killed your partner and how you hope to solve it.  
• You first approached them for help on a case.  
Describe the case. Ask them to describe the key  
expertise they provided that solved that mystery.  
• You were friends back in training, before you  
became a private investigator. This could be military,  
law enforcement, or whatever—decide the details  
between you.  
• Ask them if they live by a code and what it is. If you  
approve of the code, you’ve always respected them.  
If not (or if they don’t have a code), you’ve never  
trusted them.  
• They hired you for a job but you were too drunk or  
high to take it. Ask them what they wanted, then tell  
them how you brushed them off.  
• You first met on an unsolved crimes website. Decide  
together what infamous crime fascinates you both.

CHARM

• Manipulate Someone

COoL

• • Act Under Pressure Help Out

SHARP

• • Read a Bad Situation Investigate a Mystery

TOUGH

• • Protect Someone Kick Some Ass

WEIRD

• Use Magic

Rotes  
Whenever you use magic, you can decide afterwards  
that a particular spell is a rote that you know. See the  
separate Rotes sheet for more details.  
Temptation  
You have a dangerous drive that you pursue, sometimes  
to the exclusion of your own safety. Decide if your Temptation drove you to learn magic, or if learning magic  
drove you to it.  
Whenever you give in to your Temptation and act  
accordingly, you mark experience. You need to act under  
pressure to resist giving in to your temptation, if a perfect  
opportunity presents itself; if you fail this roll, you don’t  
mark experience like you would have if you’d willingly  
acted out your desires.  
Choose one Temptation:  
b Vengeance: Use magic to inflict disproportionate  
retribution on someone who wronged you.  
b Power: Use magic to exert your dominance over  
another.  
b Addiction: Use magic to do what you could do  
without it.  
b Callousness: Use magic without regard for the  
safety of others.  
b Carnage: Use magic to inflict gruesome violence.  
b Secrets: Use magic to discover forbidden, dangerous  
knowledge.  
b Glory: Use magic to steal someone’s thunder.  
Moves  
You have three Hex moves. You have this one:  
B Bad Luck Charm: Whenever you use magic and  
miss, the backlash never affects you directly if there’s  
someone else around to hit. It’ll go for allies, other  
hunters, and innocent bystanders. Sometimes, every  
so often, it might even hit an enemy.  
Plus pick two of these:  
b Burn Everything: When you use magic to inflict  
harm, you can choose to inflict 3-harm area magic  
obvious or 3-harm ignore-armour magic obvious.  
b Cast the Bones: Once per mystery, you may perform  
some kind of divination (tarot, casting the runes,  
reading entrails, or something like that) to glean  
information about the future. When you seek guidance by divination, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, hold 2. On  
a 7-9, hold 1. On a miss, you get some information,  
but it’s not what you want to hear. Spend those holds  
to ask any question from the investigate a mystery  
move, or one of the following questions:  
• What can I gain from this person/place/thing/creature?  
• Who has touched this person/place/thing/creature  
before me?  
The Keeper will answer truthfully, with either a  
direct answer or how to find out more.  
b Force of Will: When you apply your will to dispelling  
a magical effect, blocking a spell, or suspending a Phenomenon, roll +Weird. On a hit, momentary magics  
are cancelled completely, and long-lasting spells and  
effects are suspended temporarily. On a 10+, you can  
also spend Luck to instantly snuff out a powerful spell  
or strange effect. On a 7-9, you take 1-harm as the  
strain of dismissing magic unravels you.  
b Luck of the Damned: After you use magic or cast a  
rote, take +1 forward on the next roll you make.  
b Sympathetic Token: As long as you carry a personal  
object belonging to someone, such as a lock of hair,  
a full set of toenails, or a treasured family heirloom,  
you get +1 ongoing to use magic against them. You  
can also use magic against them at a distance. If you  
try to use magic against them and miss, the token is  
lost, destroyed, or loses its power.  
b This Might Sting: You can use magic to heal  
3-harm, but the process is exceptionally painful. On  
a 7-9 it also leaves a gnarly scar.  
b Wise Soul: Whenever you use magic, right before  
you roll, you can ask the Keeper what exactly would  
happen on a miss. If you dislike the risk, you can stop  
at the last second, and let the spell fizzle harmlessly.  
All of the effort is wasted.  
“I didn’t have magic fall into my lap. I’m not  
blessed, I’m not one of the scary children—I’m  
just a girl who found a way to give herself the  
strength to fight this war. I don’t have the option  
of not taking this risk.”

Introductions  
When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you  
can do your introductions together.  
Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your  
Hex by name and look, and tell the group what they know  
about you.  
History  
Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one  
for each of the other hunters:  
• You once cast a powerful spell or curse on them. Tell  
them why, and ask them how it ended.  
• They fear your power, or what you might do with it.  
Ask them why.  
• You’re madly in love with them. Ask them if they can  
tell.  
• They encourage you to indulge your temptation. Ask  
them why.  
• They keep you grounded, and are unfazed by your  
displays of power.  
• You were part of the same cult, sect, or secret society.  
Decide together what horrible things you did in the  
name of power.  
• You learned through divination that they’re important and you should help them. Decide whether  
you’ve told them or not.  
• They helped you out when a spell went awry. Tell  
them what the spell was, and ask them how they  
helped you.  
Leveling Up  
When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level  
up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the  
list below.  
Improvements  
b Get +1 Weird, max +3.  
b Get +1 Cool, max +2.  
b Get +1 Charm, max +2.  
b Get +1 Sharp, max +2.  
b Take another Rote.  
b Take another Rote.

b Take another Hex move, or an additional Rote.  
b Take another Hex move, or an additional Rote.  
b Take a Haven, like the Expert has, with two options.  
b Take a move from another playbook.  
After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for  
advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re  
below.  
ADVANCED IMprovements  
b Get +1 to any rating, max +3.  
b Change this hunter to a new type.  
b Make up a second hunter to play as well as this one.  
b Mark two of the basic moves as advanced.  
b Mark another two of the basic moves as advanced.  
b Retire this hunter to safety.  
b Erase one used Luck mark from your playbook.  
b Gain another two Rotes.  
b Choose one advanced Hex move (see below).  
Advanced Hex Moves  
When you take the “Choose one advanced Hex move”  
improvement, choose one of these moves. You can never  
have both:  
b Apotheosis: You become a terrifying fount of mystical power. Once per mystery, after you suffer loss  
or harm, you may enter a state where you have both  
immense power and zero interest in the well-being  
of other people. While in this state, you can fly, use  
+Weird to kick some ass instead of +Tough (using  
innate magic as a 3-harm weapon with whatever  
properties you choose), ignore the component costs  
of your rotes, ignore one requirement of every spell  
you cast with use magic, and you have +1 ongoing  
to do everything. On the other hand, you outright  
cannot use the protect someone move, you have  
all the Temptations, and you have to indulge them  
whenever a good opportunity presents itself. When  
you try to resist a temptation, roll +Cool. On a 10+,  
your apotheosis ends. On a 7-9, it ends with you  
doing something dangerous or cruel. On a miss, it  
ends only after you harm someone (or something)  
you love.  
b Synthesis: You manage to conciliate your dark  
power with your moral impulses. You lose your  
Temptation. Whenever you use magic to help out  
or protect someone, you mark experience. Mark a  
second experience if you do it at the expense of your  
own safety.

Rotes (The Hex)  
Whenever you use magic, you can decide afterwards that  
a particular spell is a rote that you know. Write down in  
detail what the spell does, and what it requires. You know  
how to cast it off the top of your head, and you choose  
two requirements from this list:  
• Magic words and ritual gestures.  
• An object of power (wand, talisman, orb, staff, etc)  
which must be wielded.  
• An expendable component such as sulfur, sage, or  
incense, which must be burned, blown, or scattered during the casting.  
• Runes or symbols written or engraved on a surface  
(which must be prepared).  
• A spilling of blood, which inflicts 1-harm upon  
you or a willing participant.  
Give your new rote a name, and decide specifically  
what the requirements are (which words, gestures,  
objects, symbols, and procedures are required). Unlike  
regular use magic, a rote’s cost and the consequences for  
failing it are known to you in advance. After you cast it  
for the first time, treat each rote as a custom move—a  
specialised version of use magic, which is built with the  
Keeper. Write down what it does on a 10+, a 7-9, and a  
miss. Also, a rote is a bit more powerful than a basic use  
magic spell: its glitches are less onerous and its effect  
may be a little bigger.  
Casting a rote requires you to have the needed items  
at hand and the ability to physically use them. You roll  
+Weird to cast it, as you would when using magic normally.  
How many rotes?  
You start out knowing up to one rote, which you can  
choose when creating your character or during play. You  
can learn more by taking improvements—when you do,  
you can choose the new rote right away or in play.

CHARM

Moves  
You get all of the basic moves, plus three Pararomantic  
moves.  
You get this one:  
B Supernatural Guide: You have a (most likely intimate) connection to some supernatural being who  
is your guide into the world beyond. Choose if your  
relationship is secret or not.  
Determine what kind of creature your Guide is  
and how your relationship works. Say what kind of  
power they possess. The Keeper will decide how it  
works and define your Guide as a threat.  
If your Guide is another hunter, determine  
together how your relationship works.  
Whenever you would roll +Weird you can roll  
+Charm instead, by channeling the power of your  
bond. When you do so and miss, in addition to the  
usual consequences, you and your Guide suffer as  
when you miss a roll for bond abuse.  
Then pick two of these:  
b Bonding Time: If you spend some quality time  
with your Guide instead of working on the current  
mystery you can roll +Charm. On 10+, hold 2. On  
7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold to:  
• Erase one mark in your Relationship Status track.  
• Use a Pararomantic move you haven’t picked.  
• Receive a gift from your Guide.  
• Take +1 forward.  
b Dark Desires: You may use the manipulate  
someone move on monsters, as long as you are  
using emotional ties.  
b The Power of Love: When you use help someone  
to help your Guide you don’t have to roll +Cool. You  
automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10. If  
your Guide is another hunter, the same applies when  
they help you.  
b Do As The Supernatural Do: You can take an  
unnatural move from your Guide’s playbook (if they  
are a hunter). If they are a monster, choose a move  
from a suitable supernatural playbook. The Keeper  
may offer you a custom move, instead.  
b I Am Theirs And They Are Mine: Whenever you  
are in danger, your Guide knows it. If your Guide is  
suffering harm (and it’s feasible), you can spend a  
point of Luck to redirect the attack onto yourself as  
if you have rolled 10+ with protect someone. If you  
are suffering harm, you can decide that your Guide  
has protected you and is suffering this harm instead.  
If you choose this, roll for bond abuse.  
b Monster Empathy: When you try to work out what  
a supernatural creature desires, roll +Charm. On a  
10+, hold 2. On a 7-9, hold 1. Spend your hold to  
ask the following questions—the Keeper will answer  
honestly:  
• What does it most desire?  
• What would it accept as good enough for now?  
• What would distract it?  
b Spirit Touched: Your experiences have made you  
sensitive to the supernatural. When you sense magical  
things, roll +Weird. On a 10+ you can sense them  
fully. On a 7-9, choose: either sense them fully but  
they notice you too, or you sense only impressions.  
Bond Abuse  
For details, see fate of your love on the reverse side.  
Bond Abuse: Whenever you do something to abuse the  
bond with your Guide, like acting against them, or not  
giving them enough attention, roll +Charm:  
• On 10+, your action has no effect beyond the  
exchange of some angry words.  
• On 7-9 choose one of the bond abuse options below.  
• On a miss, the Keeper may choose two of the bond  
abuse options below, or something worse.  
Bond abuse options:  
• Mark off a box in your Relationship Status track.  
• You may not channel the power of your bond for the  
rest of the mystery.  
• You gain the unwelcome attention of others of your  
Guide’s kind.  
• Someone who shouldn’t know finds a clue about  
your relationship with your Guide.

locket. It either provides 1-armour magic or protects you  
from the powers of a specific sort of monster.

staff, holy mace (2-harm hand messy). Additionally, add  
“magic,” “silver,” “holy,” or “iron” to the weapon.

Introductions  
When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so  
you can do your introductions together.  
Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your  
Pararomantic by name and look, and tell the group  
what they know about you.  
History  
Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick  
one for each of the other hunters:  
• Your best friend in the world. You trust them  
totally.  
• You are blood-kin. Decide your exact relationship together.  
• Your ex. Ask them why you aren’t together  
anymore.  
• Romantic entanglement, or fated to be romantically entangled.  
• They know about some of your dark secrets, but  
they’ve agreed to keep quiet about them. Tell  
them what they know.  
• An old rivalry has turned into a tight friendship.  
Ask them what (or who) you once fought over.  
• Mentor from another life. Ask them what they  
taught you.  
Fate Of Your Love  
There is a reason why your love with your Guide (the  
supernatural being you have a connection with) is forbidden or doomed. Invent this reason or leave it to  
the Keeper. Whenever you mark off a point of Luck,  
the truth of your love’s Fate slowly unfolds: mark off a  
box in your Relationship Status track. When your last  
point of Luck is used it becomes clear you cannot be  
together. Your Guide might even end up as an enemy,  
depending on how things go.  
Whenever you put yourself or somebody else in  
serious danger in order to conceal the truth about you  
and your Guide, mark experience.

Moves  
You get all of the basic moves, plus three Searcher moves.  
You get this one:  
B First Encounter: One strange event started you  
down this path, sparking your need to discover the  
truth behind the unexplained. Decide what that  
event was: pick a category below and take the associated move. Then tell everyone what happened to you  
(or someone close to you).  
b Cryptid Sighting: You take note of any reports  
of strange creatures. Whenever you first see a  
new type of creature, you may immediately ask  
one of the investigate a mystery questions.  
b Zone of Strangeness: Things are not fixed. You  
never need act under pressure when supernatural forces alter the environment around  
you, and you get 2-armour against harm from  
sudden changes to the laws of physics.  
b Psychic Event: Your mind is awakened. You may  
act under pressure to use the sensitive weird  
move, or—if sensitive is your weird move—  
empath. See page 21 of Tome of Mysteries.  
b Higher power: Something looks out for you.  
You start with an extra Luck.  
b Strange Dangers: You are always watching for  
hazards. When you have no armour, you still  
count as having 1-armour.  
b Abduction: They taught you hidden knowledge.  
Gain +1 to any move when you research strange  
or ancient secrets to do it.  
b Cosmic Insight: You have encompassed the  
soul of the universe. You never need to act  
under pressure due to feelings of fear, despair,  
or isolation.  
Then pick two of these:  
b Prepared to Defend: Even truth seekers need to  
fight some times. Whenever you suffer harm when  
you kick some ass or protect someone, you suffer  
1-harm less.  
b Fellow Believer: People understand you’ve also  
known strangeness. Bystanders will talk to you about  
weird things they would not trust another hunter (or  
a mundane official) to believe.  
b Guardian: You have a mystical ally (perhaps a spirit,  
alien, or cryptid) who helps and defends you. Define  
them, and their powers, with the Keeper’s agreement. Their look is one of: invisible, an intangible  
spirit thing, a weird creature, disguised as an animal,  
or disguised as a person.  
b Just Another Day: When you have to act under  
pressure due to a monster, phenomenon, or mystical effect, you may roll +Weird instead of +Cool.  
b Network: You may gain an ally group of others who  
had experiences similar to your first encounter—  
perhaps they’re a support group or hobbyist club.  
Detail up to five members with useful skills related  
to what happened to them (none are up for fighting  
monsters).  
b Ockham’s Broadsword: When you first encounter  
something strange, you may ask the Keeper what sort  
of thing it is. They will tell you if it (or the cause) is:  
natural, an unnatural creature, a weird phenomenon,  
or a person. You gain +1 forward dealing with it.  
b The Things I’ve Seen: When you encounter a creature or phenomenon, you may declare that you have  
seen it before. The Keeper may ask you some questions about that encounter, and will then tell you one  
useful fact you learned and one danger you need to  
watch out for (maybe right now).

perfectly, but long before they were born. Tell them  
if you have mentioned this.  
• A relative. Decide between you how close.

your first encounter. Perhaps it was the same event,  
or perhaps you investigated their event later. Ask  
them how the event affected them.  
• You figured out a supernatural or weird secret they  
keep. Ask them what it is.  
• You met when you were each investigating seperate  
mysteries. Tell them what trick you used to protect  
them from weirdness and ask them how they saved  
you from a danger.

a treatment program. Work out the details between  
you.
