## Backstory
[[Aunnabelle]] was born to a nomadic [[Changeling]] tribe that traveled the northern regions of [[Aven]] providing services and counseling to towns and cities a long the way. ![[Changeling#^03022a]]. [[Aunnabelle]] was always fascinated by face that normally lead social interactions with non-changelings, [[Ruz]]. 

Parents left her with a group of druids (mainly elves, gnomes, and a couple giants) when she was eight. [[Aunnabelle]] still doesn't know why they left her their but it doesn't bother her much. She really just avoids thinking about it much. Their parents came back once when she was twelve, but when they came it was a very odd experience. They didn't have much time to see her, and their conversations were really brief and introductory. They left after just a few hours.

[[Aunnabelle]]'s druidic family has always been very very full of love but also strict in ways that didn't always make sense to [[Aunnabelle]]. Her experiences with them shaped her very strongly, but she is happy to be on her own. 

[[Aunnabelle]] has always had peculiar interests. While most druids are very much focused on grow and nurturing plants, [[Aunnabelle]] becomes most interested when plants are nearing death. As fields would near grow brown and wither [[Aunnabelle]] would sit in them for hours.  

[[Ruz]] is the face of her [[Changeling tribe]] that usually talks with strangers at first glance
