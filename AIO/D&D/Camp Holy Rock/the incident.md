Last year ([[2020]]) at [[Camp Holy Rock]], an "incident" occurred. To most peoples knowledge, a tornado had blown over a tree which stuck in front of the gym doors and hit a gas pipe. This prevented the campers and the counselors from leaving the gym while it was flooded with gas. Most everybody has fuzzy or no memory of most of camp that week. 

Of course this is not the real story. In fact, last year storm monster attacked the camp, terrorizing the campers, and unfortunately killing most of the counselors. [[Grace Moreston]] had taken shelter with the campers in the gym during the attack, and the counselors stopped the monster, but at the cost of their lives. After the attack the [[IWCC]] had come to do what they do best, wipe everybody's memories. As is normal the side affect of this memory wipe is nightmares so severe that they usually prevent the wipee from ever going to place of the indent again, but [[Grace Moreston]] is determined and is back camp once again, despite her nightly fears.
