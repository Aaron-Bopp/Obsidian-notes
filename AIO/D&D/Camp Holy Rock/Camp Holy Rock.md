Maybe you're hoping that this summer will be a bit more exciting that normal, maybe you are running away from something whether you know what it is or not, or maybe you just decided that it would be fun to be a camp counselor. When you signed up to be a counselor for Camp Holy Rock you expected to have some summer fun, get away from your problems, and maybe make some new friends, but instead you are plunged head first into a world of mystery, magic, and monsters.
