If it’s a new mystery, have everyone who has a start-of-the-mystery move do it now.

Update [[the hunters]]’ [[harm]] to account for [[healing]] time:

- If there’s been some time to get treatment and recover, have everyone erase all [[harm]].
- If you are following right on the last mystery, everyone gets 1-[[harm]] healed.
