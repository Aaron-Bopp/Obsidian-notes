When you have marked off all your Luck, [[the Keeper]] is allowed to hit you with more bad stuff. Fate will be looking for some payback.

If your playbook includes fate-related stuff (such as [[the Chosen]]’s fate or [[the Spooky]]’s dark side), [[running out of Luck]] means all that bad stuff is going to start happening.
