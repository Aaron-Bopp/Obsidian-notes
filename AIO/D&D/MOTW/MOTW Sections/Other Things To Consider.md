The rhythms of hunter development and [[arcs]] are not the only things that you should use to make decisions about when a game is ending. If a hunter dies and the player creates a fresh replacement, or someone decides to play a second character, then that new hunter starts at the beginning. This will mix up the capabilities between the different characters. And if hunters are retiring and being replaced on the team, that might mean youâ€™re in for a long saga.
