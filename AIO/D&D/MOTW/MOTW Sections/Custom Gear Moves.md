If tags aren’t quite enough, you can also define a custom move for [[gear]]. [[Custom moves]] are dealt with in detail on [[0000915624]], but the basic idea is simple: just define when the [[gear]] works, and what it does for the user.

For example, if you get a sports car, you could define a custom move to represent its speed and performance. E.g. “When you **flee or pursue in a sports car**, you get +1 [[ongoing]].”
