At the end of each session, remember to ask the end-of-session experience questions:

- Did we conclude the current mystery?
- Did we save someone from certain death (or worse)?
- Did we learn something new and important about the world?
- Did we learn something new and important about one of [[the hunters]]?

If you get one or two “Yes” answers, have [[the hunters]] mark one experience. If you get three or four, they mark two.
