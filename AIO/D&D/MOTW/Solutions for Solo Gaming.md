Solutions for Solo Gaming

*By Mark Tygart*

*“And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.”*

—Herman Melville, *Moby Dick*

It’s going to happen sooner or later: a spouse, a friend, or someone else is going to want to venture into the cinematic world of roleplaying monster hunting coolness that is *Monster of the Week*, when comrades are unavailable or when that person insists on a bit of privacy before coming out as an honest-to-Crom tabletop role player.

Don’t fret, but be warned. Roleplaying with just one player is a whole other beast.

This is a more intense and focused experience than standard tabletop groups. Without the byplay, off-topic kibitzing, discussion, and decision-making between players, the solo player remains in focus the whole time, with the burden of investigation squarely on their shoulders. This results in an experience that feels much more like a novel than the delightful anarchy of a collaborative group game.

However, being constantly engaged can be daunting for both the player and Keeper. Here’s some play advice to prepare the Keeper for dealing with the single player format’s pressure and need for concentration.

*Monster of the Week* requires both planning and improvisation, but oddly enough I’ve found that single player requires more planning than traditional gaming. Without the inter-player banter, planning, and problem-solving, you have less time to improvise your way around surprises while delivering a coherent mystery. It is unwise to simply “wing it” in such a situation; it is helpful to have the spine of a good scenario to support your adventure. Here are some other tricks I’ve learned.

One of the things that will help a solo player is Luck and a Keeper being less stingy with those valuable Luck points than an ordinary game requires. Michael Sands advises 2-4 Luck points in a convention game.

In a solo one-shot game I would generally double that number.

In solo mysteries I often give a player ‘adventure points’ which act exactly like Luck points but expire if not used during the adventure, encouraging their use. This also limits the damage to an ongoing campaign if I am accidentally overly generous!

Another trick is to make sure the player has a number of helpful

‘redshirts’. This is a term from Star Trek, where a number of red-shirted lemmings could blunder in front of the monster’s attack and protect our beloved Captain Kirk from (almost) certain doom. Redshirts are useful to have around in any *Monster of the Week* game, but especially in solo play.

Sidekicks need a larger role in solo mysteries to help our lone hero or heroine. Sidekicks also provide opportunities for low-intensity scenes of friendship and camaraderie to momentarily take the pressure off the player (and the Keeper). Optionally, granting your solo hunter one of the ally/ally team moves is also a good idea.

This is where having the player work for some sort of organisation

(like the Professional’s Agency or [[The Initiate]]’s Sect) really becomes useful. The organisation can quickly help by giving the player credentials or resources but can also demand the player’s allegiance in all sorts of unsettling ways. That report on toxins in the murdered victim’s bloodstream might be on its way but it’s also paired with a ‘request’ to help dispose of both a dead body and the klutz who mismanaged the hit. Office politics can just be a killer…

If the character is going to work for an organisation, then it is in that organisation’s best interests to outfit their agent with all the sorcerous tattoos, charms, and whatnot to help shore that hunter up where they are weak. For solo hunters, high-quality gear and a generous amount of magical help should be in order. A magical tattoo that adds 1- or 2-armour is a good example.

Still, character death is really going to be something of a problem as it is the equivalent to the dreaded ‘Total Party Kill’ in a normal game and should be avoided. Instead of death, the hunter can be knocked out and left for dead or captured by the bad guys. Also, in tabletop RPGs, like comic books, death can be a new beginning.

If an ‘ordinary’ resurrection move is not an option, why not resurrect the player with a new Monstrous playbook—as a vampire, ghoul, or zombie and with a whole new set of abilities and problems when they get back their case? Popular recent monster hunting television shows like *iZombie* have embraced this successfully. If death is the end, maybe the hero can arrange a bargain with Death or some other supernatural delay (for now), and allow for satisfying catharsis when she sacrifices herself to defeat an evil monster.

The key is the creative nature of *Monster of the Week*, which allows the rules as written to be bent to provide a playing field where a solo player can survive just as well as a team of hunters. In an ideal world she would even be joined by a few comrades in a future adventure—a chance to play the game as designed. Still, solo or team-based, the reality is those monsters aren’t going to slay themselves!

Good hunting!
