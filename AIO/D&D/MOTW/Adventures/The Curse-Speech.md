The Curse-Speech

*By Marek Golonka*

# Overview

In this mystery, the main threat is a language: Curse-Speech. This is a semi-sentient tongue of black magic formulas. Curse-Speech allows those who know it to use vile magic—but it also forces them to rely more and more on these foul enchantments to solve their problems. The hunters are caught in a struggle between a group of occultists devoted to this language and an ambitious businessman who learned it recently.

Possible leads:

-   Our heroes have been tracking The Circle of Curses and they catch Hans precisely when Curse-Speech abandons him, forcing a blasphemous shout out of his mouth.

-   Completely eradicating Curse-Speech from Earth is needed to fulfil an ancient prophecy.

-   The hunters are shopping at Salzwedel Mall when Helmut uses Curse-Speech and they see the effects.

-   A contact tells the hunters about the Circle of Curses and the terrible things they do.

-   A contact reports evil magic happenings at the mall.

# Curse-Speech

*Phenomenon: Artifact (motivation: to grant someone more power than they can handle)*

Curse-Speech is a simple ‘language’ of about a hundred words of power and destruction. It has a bodiless consciousness, is aware of all the people who know the Curse-Speech, and can influence their minds. The Curse-Speech allows its ‘hosts’ to invoke powerful energies but the cost is always high.

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image105.jpg" style="width:5.965in;height:4.4375in" />Curse-Speech is contagious: anybody who learns the words can understand its true power and feels the urge to use it (if the CurseSpeech wishes). People experienced in the occult, hunters included, are at greater risk because hearing just a few words is enough to figure out how to open yourself to the Curse-Speech. It wants to sow great chaos, but its power is limited. It can be active only in the minds of about a dozen people at once. Therefore, when it finds it finds somebody with greater destructive potential it will abandon one of its current hosts—literally disappearing from their mind—and then manipulate the other hosts to teach Curse-Speech to the new recruit, whether they wish to learn or not.

**Powers:**

-   **Unlucky Listener**: The first hunter to spend Luck during this mystery will learn Curse-Speech by accident at the next opportunity. This takes the place of the hunter’s Special Move, if you are using those.

**Weakness:** Being banished from the minds of its hosts.

Banishing anything from a person’s mind is **big magic**. Banishing the CurseSpeech when it wants to stay is really, really **big magic**. The ritual requires:

-   Three participants in addition to the subject.

-   A plate made from a precious material inscribed with the information that is to be forgotten.

-   A fire able to destroy the plate, probably a magical one.

-   The subject of the ritual must abstain from practicing any magic for a week afterwards or they will remember the Curse-Speech again.

**Custom Moves:**

**Cursed Mind**: When you first learn Curse-Speech, roll +Cool:

-   On a 10+ you hold 3 and the Keeper holds 1.

-   On an 7-9, you both hold 2.

-   On a miss, the Keeper holds 3.

You can spend your holds to change any **cursed magic** moves into regular **use magic** instead. The Keeper’s holds are used to force the hunter to cast a **cursed magic** spell in any situation when magic could help them out.

**Cursed Magic**: When you **know the Curse-Speech and use magic**, you must use this cursed version of the move. Roll +Weird:

-   On an 11+ your magic works as advanced **use magic**. The Keeper also gains 1 **Cursed Mind** hold as the power overwhelms you.

-   On a 9+, treat this as a 10+ **use magic** result.

-   On a 6-8, treat this as a 7-9 **use magic** result.

-   On a 5 or less, treat it as a 6 or less **use magic** result, plus you’re so overwhelmed with power that the Keeper gains 2 **Cursed Mind** hold.

Choose one of the glitches listed below (in addition to any normal glitches required):

-   The spell looks, sounds and/or smells evil to everyone around.

-   The spell causes harm or misfortune to someone or something you hold dear.

-   Somebody present learns the Curse-Speech.

If you’re using alternative Weird moves, then hunters with new moves instead of **use magic** gain the ability to use magic when they know the Curse-Speech.

Those with classic **use magic** get an additional +1 on the Cursed Magic move.

# Helmut Salzwedel

*Minion: Plague (motivation: to swarm and destroy)*

An ambitious business potentate, owner of the second biggest mall in the city. Clever, charismatic, and handsome but also greedy and short-sighted.

The Curse-Speech infected him knowing that he’ll do much harm with its power, both to those around him and himself.

# Lidia Salzwedel

*Minion: Traitor (motivation: to betray people)*

Helmut’s newly-wed wife is worthy of him: sly, manipulative, and wanting his luxurious life even more than his pretty face. Helmut considers family life to be a show of wealth and he wants to have somebody around him to impress. It won’t end well...

# Salzwedel Mall

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together), but at Dusk on the countdown, the mall becomes a Maze (motivation: to confuse and separate)*

Helmut is good at tricking others into unfavourable contracts—so his mall is filled with shops and service points struggling to make ends meet, usually prioritising low price over high quality. When Helmut began using Curse-Speech to help his business, the mall soaked up the dark energies and became an incarnation of Curse-Speech. It now feeds on the life energy of customers and sometimes makes their wishes come true in a warped way.

# Benjamin's Bistro

*Location: Crossroads (motivation: to bring people, and things, together)*

A cheap but clean and cozy restaurant in Salzwedel Mall. Regular customers and some employees come here to eat a reasonably priced dinner and chat.

# Benjamin Fischer

*Bystander: gossip (motivation: to pass on rumors)*

Talkative and open owner of the bistro; everybody’s friend here. However, he doesn’t like Helmut and loves gossiping about him.

# The Circle of Curses

A group of black mages who have known Curse-Speech for a long time, did terrible things with it, and have learned to use it quite safely... so safely that the language left Hans (the least promising of them all) and moved on. Now the Circle are doing their best to find if there is a new Curse-Speaker. They aim to ally with him... or eliminate him.

All the Circle members have the same abilities (except Hans, who can no longer use the black magic attack).

**Attacks:** **Black magic** 2-harm close ignore-armour magic. **Dagger** 1-harm hand.

**Harm capacity:** 7. <sup>\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]\[\]</sup> **Weakness:** None, just a regular human.

Below are the members of the circle: Ilse Herschwor

*Minion: Traitor (motivation: to betray people)*

Ambitious, stubborn, with the darkest past of any in the Circle. Wolfgang Dietrich

*Minion: Guardian (motivation: to bar the way or protect something)*

Silent, observant, always plotting something. Lene Janz

*Minion: Brute (motivation: to intimidate and attack)* Loud, loyal to the Circle, arrogant.

## Peter Messmann

*Minion: Scout (motivation: to stalk, watch, and report)* Curious, well-educated, immoral. Annemieke Kahler

<img src="./TomeIMGs/media/image107.png" style="width:5.99667in;height:4.90333in" />*Minion: Cultist (motivation: to save her own skin at any cost)* Manipulative, unsure, older than the others, and scared of aging.

## Hans Großtern

*Minion: Renfield (motivation: to push victims towards the monster)*

Wise, good memory, little ambition. Has now lost the Curse-Speech.
