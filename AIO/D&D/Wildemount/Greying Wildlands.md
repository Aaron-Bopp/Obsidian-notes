Pressed against the northeastern coast of Wynandir is a desert of ice and snow, separated from the [[Dwendalian Empire]] by the jagged [[Dunrock Mountains]] and the Quannah Breach. This landscape of dense, desiccated forests, rolling mountains, and icy tundra is known as the Greying Wildlands, the southern part of the [[Biting North]] that encompasses this region as well as the [[islands of Eiselcross]]. The [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] has struggled to expand into the region, leaving its denizens to focus on their own survival in the harsh territory, where wandering outlanders and barbarous hunters stalk the unchecked wilderness. Tucked beyond the edge of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]'s reach, past the shadowed dangers of the dense, frozen foliage, lies the dwarven citadel of [[Uthodurn]], which has become the home of many [[elves]] who survived the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]].

Map 3.6: Greying Wildlands

### Blooming Grove

Nearly ten miles northwest of [[Shadycreek Run]], deep in the [[Savalirwood]], a centuries-old willow grove and small temple have held back the curse that darkens these woods. The Clay family, heralds to the Wild Mother and the [[Corellon|Arch Heart]], built this holy place as a funeral grove of renewal, designed to return the bodies of the fallen to nature while letting their spirits move on. Each bloodline that is interred among the swampy ponds and vibrant leaves nurtures a wholly unique flower, giving the location the macabre nickname of the Bone Orchard.

Time does not stand still, however. The curse of the wood has eaten away at the holy boundaries of the grove. Dark vines and thorns reclaim layer on layer of fences and grave markers, pushing the once-expansive grove into a small patch of defiant green at the base of the temple. Only one of the keepers remained to watch over the decay of their grove, and now this priest, named Caduceus, has left in the hopes of discovering a way to reclaim the orchard and the ancestry it protects in the name of [[Melora]].

### Boroftkrah

**Population:** 3,060 (70% [[orcs]], 17% [[Orcs|half-orcs]], 13% other [[races]])

**Government:** The town is guided by a circle of elder warriors known as the [[Runemarked]].

**Defense:** A force of hunter-warriors defends the settlement, but every able-bodied citizen is trained in combat to defend [[Boroftkrah]].

**Commerce:** Basic everyday supplies are available, as well as simple crafts and weapons.

**Organizations:** A shrine to [[Kord]] sits in the center of the town, but no organizations, religious or otherwise, exist in [[Boroftkrah]].

After the [[Orcs|orc]]'s creator god [[Gruumsh]] was banished in the [[Divergence]], many of the war clans of his bloody army fled and went into hiding. Splintered from the same throng of Odakar [[orcs]] that held the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], the leaderless droves migrated northward to the [[Rime Plains]]. Although they were severed from the direct influence of the Ruiner, the directionless [[orcs]] began to succumb to the Ruiner's "gift" of bloodlust. A schism tore the clans asunder, and from the bloodshed emerged a new clan of orcish marauders known as the Jez-Araz.

The remaining champions of the Odakar clan, determined to survive, found inspiration in [[Kord]], the Storm Lord they had once fought against. They formed an organized clan of warrior [[orcs]] who seek to overcome the Ruiner's murderous influence and find strength within themselves. From this new path, the [[Boroftkrah]] [[Orcs|orc]] clan and the settlement of [[Boroftkrah]] was born, creating a strong community that values deeds done in service to the clan. The [[orcs]] of [[Boroftkrah]] wander the surrounding plains in heavy furs and leathers, seeking ways to commune with [[Kord]] through challenges of survival and contests of hunting and tracking skill. While the clan is overwhelmingly of orcish descent, on rare occasions they welcome outsiders who prove themselves strong in the eyes of [[Kord]].

Like many of their southern brethren, the [[orcs]] of [[Boroftkrah]] continue to eschew the hunger for violence that [[Gruumsh]] supposedly instilled in the orcish people when he created them. They take pride in victory and the success of the hunt, making great offerings of powerful prey to the Storm Lord. They channel their desire for war into battling the harsh lands that surround them to ensure the survival of their community. While most [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] choose to shed their shackles of murderous rage, they remain territorial, often fighting their ferocious Jez-Araz cousins or coming into conflict with hunting parties from [[Uthodurn]].

The settlement is guided by a circle of elder warriors who have proven themselves the strongest and most dedicated to the survival of the clan. If the circle has a vacancy, volunteers prove their worthiness in a series of contests before the central idol of [[Kord]], ending with a rune-casting ceremony that invokes [[Kord]]'s will toward who will become an elder warrior. Under these elder warriors, all others are equal and trained to take up arms if the settlement is in danger.

Crime is not common within [[Boroftkrah]]. A strong sense of honor often prevents the urge for criminal activity. It is rare for anyone within the clan to steal or take from others, unless both parties agree to a challenge to see who is worthy. Those that do steal are shamed as unworthy and exiled from the clan to wander the Greying Wildlands alone.

The settlement of [[Boroftkrah]] is a loose collection of tents and shelters surrounded by a tall fence of wooden pikes. The town is created to be mobile if serious danger threatens its current location. Neighborhoods are formed in large circles of homesteads called lods. Giant boars and powerful worgs of the plains are trained as mounts and kept in scattered holding pens.

Navigating [[Boroftkrah]] is its own adventure. To gain the trust of the [[orcs]], the characters must prove themselves in contests of strength.

_**Storm Celebration (Low Level).**_ When lightning splits the sky, the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] honor [[Kord]] with competitive games that last until the storm breaks. Characters who have earned the [[orcs]]' trust might find themselves volunteered as participants or judges during such a time. Meanwhile, an [orc eye of Gruumsh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc-eye-of-[[gruumsh]]) leads a band of [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc) and [orog](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orog) warriors who have secretly begun worshiping the Ruiner. They plan to display their faith during the contest by turning the games into a bloodbath, hoping to convert other [[orcs]] with the promise of glorious bloodshed, and murder any who resist.

### Cinderrest Sanctum

Hidden along the eastern slopes of [[Kravaraad]] is a cavern of onyx, where a pool of uncooling lava sits at the heart of the black stone grotto. Within this spacious chamber, black iron adornments and supports bear tales etched in runes. Carved reliefs depict dwarven interpretations of [[Melora]] granting stone and ore from below the ground to [[Moradin]] the [[Moradin|All-Hammer]], for him to craft into great halls and mighty guardians.

This shrine has been watched over by the Dust family for generations, maintained by the offerings delivered by the reverent of [[Uthodurn]]. Those who make the pilgrimage to [[Cinderrest Sanctum]] are invited to pray to [[Melora]] and [[Moradin]], while perhaps gaining access to the Underforge, a great forge built over many decades as tribute to the partnership between the two deities. With their divine blessings, it is said that powerful artifacts with great destinies are crafted.

### Crystalsands Tundra

During the [[Age of Arcanum]], this land was a vibrant continuation of the [[Veluthil Forest]]. However, stories speak of a great battle during [[the Calamity]] that violently dashed this region into rock and sand. Winter quickly reclaimed the new desert, the sands freezing over with northern ice and snow. Tall dunes glitter like piles of diamonds in the daylight, shifting with high winds and the movements of the remorhazes and frost worms that burrow and hunt beneath the sands. Nomadic clans of northern goblins form hunting parties and ride winter wolves, stalking the furred beasts that call these frosted dunes home. Other beings stay hidden to avoid the giant hawks and giant owls that fly over from the [[Flotket Alps]] in search of prey. In times of fresh snowfall, travel is extremely dangerous, since the soft powder obscures the shifting sands and ice-marked tunnels that lead to the gnashing jaws of the subterranean frost worms. Some travelers have speculated that, depending on the winds, great structures of forgotten epochs become partially revealed as the sands and frost are temporarily scattered, only to be swallowed up once more as the dunes shift in the next storm.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-13.png)

[[Crystalsands Tundra]]

A tribe of [[wildfolk]] who worship [[Quajath]] are scattered across the northern fields of the Crystalsands, calling themselves the Mawcotters. They hunt by digging tunnels and caves in the sands and nearby rock, then lying in wait to spring when their quarry falls into the trap. These fanatical people make an annual journey across the treacherous [[Frigid Depths]] to the [[Eiselcross]] island of [[Gelier]] to mine flesh from the frozen body of [[Quajath]]. This meat is then brought back to the Crystalsands and ritualistically devoured by the leaders of these worm-[[Cults in Wildemount|cults]], and by the young as a rite of adulthood. Fortunately for them, the flesh travels long enough before consumption to avoid the full wormkin transformation (see "[Tomb of the Worm](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross#TomboftheWorm "[[Tomb of the Worm]]")" later in this chapter). The Mawcotters eagerly seek a way to one day free their patron from its icy prison.

#### Crystalsands Tundra Adventures

Traversing these endless fields of frozen dust is a thrilling and dangerous journey for any adventurer.

_**Fair-Weather Friends (Mid Level).**_ While crossing the wind-swept snow dunes, the characters encounter three young [remorhazes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/remorhaz) that do not attack. They are instead following Shwells (chaotic neutral, female, [[Gnomes|gnome]] [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout)), who wields a recently scavenged pale, blue orb that keeps the creatures docile. She will not part with the orb and has grown attached to her monstrous companions, but characters with arcane knowledge will notice the orb is drawing more remorhazes to it from all across the tundra, and the magic that subdues the creatures appears to be rapidly fading.

### Flotket Alps

Dominating the central region between the [[Crystalsands Tundra]] and the [[Rime Plains]], the range of mountains known as the [[Flotket Alps]] is a majestic, snow-covered land of scattered pine trees and rough slopes that rise to dizzyingly sharp peaks. Nomadic trolls and roving wyverns claim the caves and alcoves of the mountainsides, hunting other inhabitants who've also adapted to the arctic weather. This alpine expanse is often battered by harsh blizzards, pushing some denizens underground into the maze of ice caverns that wind throughout the range, abandoned by some long-forgotten society and turned into the home of several warring frost giant clans. Among the natural chaos of the alps, the subterranean city of [[Uthodurn]] and its people seek to tame the wild crags around them and spread beyond the boundaries of this frozen highland.

Icy spires and snowy paths wind though these mountains, leading travelers who survive the Alps to new challenges and rewards.

_**A Deserving Dare (High Level).**_ Hidden among the shallow chasms of ice is the lair of Yondis the Winter Star, an [androsphinx](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/androsphinx) with pure white fur. It watches over the tomb of a heroic group of champions who sacrificed themselves in the final battles of [[the Calamity]]. Those who wish to claim the arms and instruments of these legendary figures must prove their worth to Yondis through numerous quests or challenges — and the sphinx has no mercy for those who fail.

### Ivory Lake

Fed by the annual snow melt and heavy rains that wash across the [[Flotket Alps]], [[Ivory Lake]] is the largest source of standing fresh water in the region. Many creatures throughout the [[Rime Plains]] make their way to the lake during the summer when the waters are thawed and the fish are plentiful. The banks of the lake are dangerous for smaller beasts and humanoids alike, as wyverns and other predators lie in wait to gorge on unsuspecting travelers.

### Kravaraad

Black, burning, and defiant against the frost and cold of the north, the volcano of [[Kravaraad]] looms in the heart of the [[Flotket Alps]]. Perpetual streaks of dark smoke rise up to blend with heavy steam from the trails of molten rock that cool against the surrounding ice. The mountain is known for a continuous, gradual flow of glowing lava from multiple vents, but massive eruptions are extremely rare. The heat of the lava allows a pair of adjacent freshwater lakes, known as the Mistpools, to provide liquid water year-round. Its dramatic presence among the pale, snow-powdered trails of the Flotkets makes [[Kravaraad]] an important landmark for travelers in the snowy region. Hardier creatures live in the surrounding snowmelt, often competing for territory against the fire giants who claim the northern side and interior of the volcano. Many such battles echo through the mountains like distant thunder, calling other denizens to come witness the struggle, or to wait and finish off the survivors.

The volcano attracts creatures dangerous enough to make traveling near [[Kravaraad]] an adventure of its own.

_**Vault of the Fire Giants (High Level).**_ [[Kravaraad]]'s [fire giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/fire-giant) have greedily amassed treasure since the time before [[the Calamity]]. To reach their subterranean vault, the characters must sneak by or carve through the latest creatures who have challenged the fire giants (often [frost giants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/frost-giant) or other creatures that can endure the cold). But making it to the fire giants is only half the battle. The fire giants have hewn a vast dungeon under the mountain, and characters must navigate its perils while maintaining their balance whenever [[Kravaraad]] causes the entire complex to tremble. The vault itself is guarded by an enslaved [adult red dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-red-[[dragon]]) that longs to be free.

### Mythburrow

In the farthest reaches of the northeast Greying Wildlands, tucked low near the base of the [[Flotket Alps]], the ominous, icicle-wreathed mouth of a deep mountain cavern plunges into the heart of the rocky range. The locals who call this place [[Mythburrow]] tell stories of a monstrous, ancient being that claims dominion over the surrounding lands. Tales of a bellowing roar that shakes the valley have been told for centuries, and some even claim to have seen the frightful wingspan of the immense white-scaled [[dragon]] that calls [[Mythburrow]] home. While many joke about the siren call of a [[dragon]]'s hoard, few have the mettle to venture into this cavern in search of wealth and glory — and those who did enter the cave never returned.

Deep within the [[Mythburrow]], something old and terrible shifts in seclusion, plotting its next hunt in the lands above.

_**Gelidon (High Level).**_ All trade and communication from [[Palebank Village]] (described below) halts suddenly and without warning. When the characters are sent to investigate, they find the entire area transformed into a frozen nightmare, the village leveled and the remaining corpses locked within jagged ice. Uthodurnian scouts report sightings of the long-dormant [ancient white dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ancient-white-[[dragon]]) Gelidon returning to its lair in [[Mythburrow]].

The [[Diarchy of Uthodurn]] puts out the call to all monster hunters and heroes, setting a handsome bounty on the head of Gelidon. The characters must now clamber down the twisting tunnels of the [[Mythburrow]] and destroy the powerful wyrm before their competition can claim the gold and glory.

### Palebank Village

**Population:** 690 (61% [[dwarves]], 32% [[elves]], 3% [[gnomes]], 4% other [[races]])

**Government:** The [[Elves|elf]] ranger Elro Aldataur is the appointed leader of the village. He delegates tasks to proven friends and trustworthy allies.

**Defense:** Elro commands a small force of errant [[Glassblades]]. Some civilians are willing to take up arms to defend the city in moments of crisis.

**Commerce:** Basic supplies can be purchased or traded at the small inns or supply shacks.

**Organizations:** There are two humble temples to [[Moradin]] and [[Corellon]], respectively. [[Uthodurn]] governs from afar, while the Tribes of Shadycreek send agents to seek more information about [[Eiselcross]].

Along the cold shore of the [[Frigid Depths]], [[Palebank Village]] marks the first surviving [[Uthodurn]] outpost beyond the mountains. The settlement is situated against the low cliff boundary of the [[Crystalsands Tundra]], just north of the [[Flotket Alps]]. The denizens of Palebank often take to ice fishing, trapping, or hunting, returning in small caravans to [[Uthodurn]] to sell their wares and restock their supplies. Territorial monsters wander close to the village, so rotating squads of [[Glassblades]] are assigned to protect the people. The small docks have been recently expanded to accommodate the increased interest in heading northwest toward [[Eiselcross]]. Palebank has become a launching point for northern expeditions, leading to growing trade and a pressing need for more inns.

The village is guided by Elro Aldataur, a weathered [[Elves|elf]] ranger who helped found Palebank roughly sixty years ago. Stoic and humorless, Elro showed a knack for leadership when the fledgling outpost was beset with danger on a near-constant basis. Elro earned the trust and respect of the residents, and they asked him to govern Palebank. He begrudgingly accepted, and has since overseen the expansion and protection of the village. Elro generally has sixty to ninety [[Glassblades]] at his command.

The people of Palebank must work together to survive in this frigid land, and there is little room in the small community to conduct any worthwhile larceny or immoral activity. What crimes do occur are born out of necessity and punished accordingly by Elro.

Surrounded by four watchtowers and a ten-foot-tall palisade of sharpened logs, Palebank is a ramshackle village locked in eternal winter. The village is made up of over a hundred cabins and shacks. It's too small to have distinct neighborhoods, so most businesses and residences were established wherever they could fit at the time, creating a meandering layout. Off the northern cliff, about fifteen feet down to the sand-and-snow beach, the docks hold around a dozen ships, ranging from fishing vessels to small cargo ships that carry expeditions to and from [[Eiselcross]].

[[Palebank Village]] would be a sleepy place without much excitement were it not for the presence of eager explorers and the settlement's importance as a waystation between [[Uthodurn]] and the [[islands of Eiselcross]].

_**Troll Night (Mid Level).**_ While the characters stay in [[Palebank Village]], the only survivor of an unlucky [[Glassblades]] patrol staggers into the village. An organized band of [trolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/troll) is coming down from the [[Flotket Alps]] toward the settlement, which needs every able-bodied warrior to keep the trolls at bay. How did these trolls get so organized, and what do they seek in the village?

### Rime Plains

These fields of rolling tundra and bursts of boreal forest stretch on and on, covering the southeastern Greying Wildlands. Wild muskox and snow foxes wander across the rocky grassland, as wolves, saber-toothed tigers, and other beasts hunt to survive the freezing nights. [[Humans]] have not yet encroached on this region, and the people of [[Uthodurn]] abandoned their expansion into the plains, so wayfaring [[orcs]] and goblinoid bands have claimed areas of the region unchallenged. The [[Rime Plains]] are a mostly open, untamed wilderness where survival depends on one's ability to endure the elements and navigate the wilds skillfully.

While the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] managed to temper their fury through their worship of the Storm Lord, a number of their kin embraced their violent past and abandoned the rest to seek greater conquests. Now known as the Jez-Araz, or "Breakers of Spirits," these violent [[orcs]] live in scattered, nomadic groups that hunt around the plains and the lower [[Flotket Alps]]. Praising [[Gruumsh]] through acts of brutality, the Jez-Araz hunting parties are a fearsome sight for any wanderer to behold.

### Ruins of Molaesmyr

Just north of the Boreal Omen River, toward the center of the warped [[Savalirwood]] forest, looms the ravaged elven city of [[Molaesmyr]]. Once a beautiful city filled with erudite scholars and designed to blend in with the towering trees by masterful elven architects, the metropolis now lies abandoned. The canopy of trees above the ruins is thick enough to block most of the sun, and massive, twisting bramble vines choke the streets and rooftops, spreading into the surrounding woods like veins from a corrupted heart. Crumbling spires lean against trees swollen with disease, halls of learning are smothered by toxic fungus and moss, and a perpetual heavy fog obscures the dangers that lurk in unseen alcoves. All manner of terrible fey creatures now call this city home. The rest of the woods are filled with natural forest denizens mutated by errant magics as well as many [[elves]] who were caught in the horrifying catastrophe and who now stalk the shadows as terrible monstrosities, mockeries of their former selves.

The ruins are considered the source of the corrupt magics that still spread throughout the [[Savalirwood]], twisting its inhabitants and keeping the [[elves]] of [[Molaesmyr]] from their home for over two hundred and fifty years. Many factions throughout the Greying Wildlands have their eyes on the ancient city, eager to uncover its secrets and its treasures. Expeditions from [[Uthodurn]] into the blighted city delve beyond the outer edges, seeking the central tower of Caes Mosor and the labyrinth beneath, where it is believed that the dark magic was unleashed. The Uthodurnian expeditions hope to uncover relics and clues that could be the key to reversing this desolation, but these dungeoneers now contend with not only the hungry monsters, but also hired mercenaries and greedy thieves from [[Shadycreek Run]] who seek to steal these same secrets for profit. The blood of both factions has been spilled in the streets of [[Molaesmyr]], and the dark spirits of the city seem to relish the violence.

The [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] can tempt the characters into their dangers with the promise of forgotten treasures and magic.

_**Cackles in the Dark (Low Level)**_. Auntie Rottongue, Nanny Filthtouch, and Granny Pustreat are a coven of [green hags](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/green-hag) living in the labyrinth beneath the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]]. The hags send their minions to steal children from [[Shadycreek Run]], then use them as test subjects for new, dark rituals. The minions are supposed to take children who will not be missed, but when they kidnap a Mardoon child, the characters are hired to delve into the ruins and recover the victim while facing the hags' corrupted fey minions.

### Savalirwood

This area was once a beautiful thicket known as the [[Veluthil Forest]], enchanted with fey magics and guarded by elven outposts. Nearly three centuries ago, the forest suffered a terrible curse wrought from the disaster that felled [[Molaesmyr]]. In the centuries since, the fey magics have grown twisted and dark, the denizens corrupt and feral. Spirits and monsters crawl up from under the cold, rotted forest floor, while shadowy whispers bring nightmares to those who sleep beneath the sinister trees. The forest has been renamed the [[Savalirwood]], for the elven word savalir, meaning "guilt." It has become a dangerous obstacle for travel, playing a major role in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]'s inability to expand northward to plunder the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]] or conquer [[Uthodurn]]. In this most recent century, the less-dangerous outskirts of the forest have become havens for criminals, leading to the establishment of [[Shadycreek Run]].

Throughout the [[Savalirwood]], a handful of small groves and clearings combat the magical miasma that infects the rest of the wood. Within many of these relatively protected locales, wild magic thrives and gentler (if slightly mad) fey guard the surrounding glades, often enthralling wandering humanoids and capturing them to keep the fey company — forever. A community of reserved, thick-furred [[tabaxi]] called the Nightback Clan lives among the dangers of the [[Savalirwood]], occasionally coming to the aid of others in need, seeking allies in their struggle to survive.

[](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/egtw/yDOyqyOocErRgYJK/03-14.png)

[[Savalirwood]]

Many denizens of the Veluthil were slain following the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]] and the spread of the mysterious curse that transformed the wood, but one group of [[tabaxi]] from the southern reaches of the forest survived and refused to flee. Knowing that the spirits of their ancestors were bound to the trees, they chose to stay and adapt, learning to live a nomadic life among the perpetual threats of the forest. Devoted to [[Melora]], the Nightback Clan patrols the forest for food and locations to briefly make home. Unpleasant encounters with folk from [[Shadycreek Run]] have left some of the Nightback Clan eager to terrorize any unlucky thieves found in the [[Savalirwood]]. The Nightback Clan also blames the [[elves]] of [[Molaesmyr]] for the tragedy that claimed the forest and refuses to speak to or work with any representatives of [[Uthodurn]].

Every journey through the dangerous, weird, and corrupt [[Savalirwood]] is an adventure.

_**Nightback Negotiation (Low Level).**_ The Nightback Clan captured a merchant caravan traveling through the [[Savalirwood]], suspecting that the travelers are thieves. The characters are hired by the merchant's family to rescue the caravan. If they can track the [[tabaxi]] through the woods, they must either convince the Nightback Clan that the travelers are innocent or fight to free the captives. Things grow more complicated when the [[tabaxi]] present compelling evidence that this merchant caravan is more than just a group of simple travelers.

_**Treantwatch (Mid Level).**_ While traveling through the forest, the characters encounter a [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) who insists on guiding them safely through the [[Savalirwood]]. The treant claims to know every nook and cranny in the forest, as well as its dangers. On the surface, it seems very helpful. However, the curse afflicting the forest has driven the treant mad and made it delusional. All the dangers it describes are inventions of its twisted mind, and it has a knack for leading the characters into one perilous situation after another.

The treant's refusal to divulge its name is the first clue that something is amiss. In truth, the treant no longer remembers its name.

_**Mapping the Gates (High Level).**_ Erma Schnieb (chaotic neutral lightfoot [[Halflings|halfling]] [mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mage)) believes that the curse infecting the [[Savalirwood]] creates portals to the Lower Planes. She hires the characters to explore the forest with her to find and map these gates. In addition to the usual nightmares that stalk the forest paths, fiends patrol the gates and attack anyone who tries to close the planar doors.

### Shadycreek Run

**Population:** 14,770 (56% [[humans]], 15% [[elves]], 14% [[dwarves]], 15% other [[races]])

**Government:** Four organized crime families and the citizen-run Greytrader Union vie for control of the city, while the mercenary peacekeepers of the Grudge Gang attempt to prevent complete chaos.

**Defense:** The [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]] each employ personal soldiers and bodyguards, while the Grudge Gang defends the city at large.

**Commerce:** Most general goods are available, and rare imports and stolen commodities are sold and auctioned in secret. Many taverns, inns, and places of vice are open to the public.

**Organizations:** Most business is run by one of the Tribes or the Union, even if alliances are hidden. The city has scattered, humble temples.

Past the northern outposts of Wynandir, a scattered line of shantytowns and hovels chokes the pathway into the trees of the wildlands alongside a small creek. Originally comprised of a patchwork of makeshift, impoverished societies run by cruel slumlords, [[Shadycreek Run]] is now known as a hive of criminal activity and savage humanity given free reign. The degenerate dregs of civilization see this place as a chance to gain untold fame and power. Most debates end in a brawl, and most brawls end in bloodshed.

The harsh, unguarded environment breeds a tough people, and despite the ravaging beasts that pick off easy prey from the outskirts, proud groups of hunters and skinners have risen to become prominent traders. Some intelligent figures have begun to organize and civilize life in the Run, hoping to bring a modicum of order and respect to the collection of reprobates, while the veterans of the Run fight to keep things unpredictable, undermining these attempts with violence. The volatile society underscores the age-old adage, "they call it the Run for a reason."

Many who choose to live within [[Shadycreek Run]] do so to avoid the persecution (or prosecution) that awaits within the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], while others have a taste for the brutal lifestyle afforded by a land of overt moral flexibility. Professions here range from artisans and craftsman to farmers, mercenaries, and entertainers. However, the most profitable entrepreneurs in the region are thieves, hunters, and scavengers who brave the deadly [[Savalirwood]] and the [[ruins of Molaesmyr]]. Powerful beasts yield hearty meat and furs, while recovered relics and lost magics fetch quite the price in distant markets. The struggle over these prizes often grows bloody, as the Tribes and the Greytrader Union battle to gain control of these trades, while also competing with the people of [[Uthodurn]] who wish to reclaim their heritage and lost belongings.

Currently, [[Shadycreek Run]] is divided between three competitive factions: the Greytrader Union, the Tribes, and the Grudge Gang.

The Greytrader Union is a faction of reformed outcasts and criminals who want to establish firm trade relationships with outside societies and help salvage [[Shadycreek Run]] by making it a safer, more functional community. The members of the union don't abide imperial rule, and they enjoy the freedom of a lawless lifestyle, but they also wish to be free of the legacy of violence for which [[Shadycreek Run]] is known. Made up of trappers, hunters, builders, and craftsmen from all walks of life, the Greytrader Union wishes to institute self-appointed marshals to keep the peace. They aim to increase the safety of civilians, turn the Run into a respectable destination for trade, and eventually diminish the influence of the Tribes and the Grudge Gang.

The Tribes are a collective of rival criminal families who ran the Run for nearly a century before they lost much of their dominance to violent infighting and internal power struggles. Comprised of the Mardoon, Uttolot, Trebain, and Jagentoth families, the Tribes work to maintain control over most of the business that transpires in the city, and conspire against each other in secret. While each family center is usually composed of relatives by blood or marriage, their employees are also considered "within the family," so long as they remain loyal. The Tribes fence stolen goods, provide vice and bawdy entertainment, and control the populace through confusion, intimidation, and fear.

The Grudge Gang is a hardened company of mercenaries who act as the muscle to enforce local interests within the Run. Founded by a band of deserters from the [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] army, they've grown into a battalion of warriors loyal to coin and each other. Members of the gang will happily work for the Greytrader Union or any of the families of the Tribes, so long as their business isn't bloody enough to harm innocents or put the safety of the Run at stake. Since the other factions rely on the Grudge Gang for protection from the terrors of the [[Savalirwood]], its members consider themselves neutral instruments in the political chess game. Some members of the gang have assigned themselves to maintain order in a land without law, calling themselves Taskers and doing their best to keep the innocent from being crushed by the city's predators. Their priorities revolve around lending their skills to whoever pays the best, maintaining livable streets, and keeping the dangers of the [[Savalirwood]] and the [[Dwendalian Empire]] out of the city.

The city has no central government or laws, so much of it is held together by a vague sense of "live and let live," broken by occasional bursts of "take what I want." If violence spirals out of control, the Grudge Gang's Taskers step in and beat everyone involved to a pulp. It's not uncommon for careless folk to wind up dead in a snow-covered alley, stripped of their goods and left to be eaten by starving dogs. Denizens of the Run learn to watch their backs and warily wield blades.

What began as an extended string of shanties and shacks built along the southern treeline of the [[Savalirwood]] has turned into a three-mile-long, crooked main street called Clover Alley, lined with hovels, buildings, and mudholes. The neighborhoods on the southern side of the Alley, called the South Clover, are the most impoverished and least maintained areas of the city, known for extremely desperate folk and even more dangerous business. The northern side, called the North Clover, is partially built into the [[Savalirwood]] itself, and houses the wealthy and powerful denizens of the Run, including most of the families of the Tribes, who live in various mansions and small strongholds.

The western end of the Clover Alley, known as the Wickerskids, is home to the scavengers and farmers who do their best to coax the harsh lands of the cold north to produce food for the people of [[Shadycreek Run]]. The central square of Clover Alley is named Clover Plaza and marks the heart of commerce, conflict, and vice within the city. In the plaza, all factions mingle in broad daylight, disguising their hidden agendas with a bawdy and loud lifestyle of indulgence and excess. The eastern end of Clover Alley, called the Gruff Slum, houses a cluster of peasants and cutpurses who live among drug dens and pig pens.

Streets of [[Shadycreek Run]]

Slack laws and the promise of easy money draw many opportunists to these dangerous streets.

_**A Stolen Heart (Low Level).**_ At the Trench Tavern, the characters join a drinking game with some of the local Grudge Gang. Win or lose, an [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc) member of the gang, Dratto, reveals their connection with the Mardoon family. Dratto mentions that they need some hands to steal a [[Molaesmyr]] relic currently held by the Trebain family. The characters can turn Dratto into the Trebains to gain their favor or agree to aid in the theft.

If the characters agree to help Dratto, a dangerous burglary ensues. They must infiltrate a guarded shed outside the Wickerskids, only to discover the relic is actually a slumbering [pixie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pixie). This creature wakes in the presence of the characters, when a mysterious aspect of one character's nature draws the pixie from out of its torpor and binds its affection to the character.

_**King's Spy (Any Level).**_ Nella Durlon (lawful neutral, nonbinary, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)) lives in [[Shadycreek Run]] as a spy for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. They gather information about the settlement's defenses to take back to Oliver Schrieber (see "[Dwendalian Empire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DwendalianEmpire "[[Dwendalian Empire]]")" in [[chapter 2]]). The characters learn of Nella's job from a faction that hires them to find the spy. Depending on the faction, the characters must either escort Nella safely out of the settlement so they can report to Oliver, or ask that Nella be killed for giving away the settlement's secrets. Either way, finding Nella is no small task. The spy is a master of their craft and blends in with the criminals and ruffians of the Run.

### Uraliss

The small town of [[Uraliss]] was [[Uthodurn]]'s first attempt to expand beyond its mountain halls. [[Uraliss]] was settled with the intent of becoming a farming village to aid in crop production. As the town began construction, arcane wards were developed and placed along a patch of snow-covered field at the base of the [[Flotket Alps]]. The wards were designed to slowly melt the snow and hopefully help develop the area into farmable land. However, the town was beset by [[orcs]] and other threats from the [[Rime Plains]], and the town's hopes were further crushed when the land beneath the snow was found to be rocky and untillable. The settlement was quickly abandoned and is now a crumbling ghost town left to be vandalized and repurposed by the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] of the [[Rime Plains]].

Characters might go to [[Uraliss]] to retrieve something left behind, study its arcane wards, or hunt a beast that lurks in the ghost town.

_**Haunted Temple of the [[Moradin|All-Hammer]] (Low Level).**_ The [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] avoid [[Uraliss]]'s temple of [[Moradin]] at all costs. The temple is filled with specters of [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] captured by a high priest who went mad and locked her congregation in the temple during the final [[Orcs|orc]] raid. All her victims starved to death, as did the priest herself, who became a [wraith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/wraith). The characters could come to this building to find a lost treasure of [[Moradin]], or to escape other threats as they pass through the ruined town.

### Uthodurn

**Population:** 26,240 (56% [[dwarves]], 36% [[elves]], 4% [[gnomes]], 4% other [[races]])

**Government:** A diarchy between the dwarven and elven monarchs rules over the populace, each leader supported by a council of nobles who share the responsibilities of overseeing the city and its functions.

**Defense:** [[Uthodurn]] maintains a well-trained army of [[Glassblades]] to keep the peace and stations scouts and skirmishers across the [[Flotket Alps]]. Nobles also employ bodyguards.

**Commerce:** Most basic goods and services are available. [[Uthodurn]]'s isolation means that imports are limited and inns for outsiders are scarce.

**Organizations:** Numerous temples dot the Volition Disc area of the city, and competing guilds do business under the oversight of the councils. Hidden agents from the [[Tribes of Shadycreek Run]] have begun to find their way into the city.

Hidden among the icy peaks of the [[Flotket Alps]], the northernmost dwarven stronghold of [[Wildemount]] is ensconced in the base of a steep mountain valley. [[Uthodurn]] is a bastion of dwarven culture, home to a secluded people who've endured the freezing temperatures and continuous snowfall across the mountains and surrounding lands since they founded the stronghold nearly eight hundred years ago. The [[dwarves]] of [[Uthodurn]] are sharp of wit, hairier than their southern brethren, and as unyielding as the rock they live in. The Queen of [[Uthodurn]] broke from stubborn dwarven traditions and opened the city's doors to thousands of elven refugees following the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]] nearly three centuries ago. While there have been moments of conflict between the [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] as ancient grudges are briefly revived, the society within these fire-warmed stone halls has grown into a unique union of both cultures.

Beyond the iron doors of the city, the wildlands surrounding the underground stronghold are brutally cold and battered by cutting winds. The people of [[Uthodurn]] hunt and track in bursts, like sudden flurries of snow, stalking the wild white bison and cliffneck goats that call the [[Flotket Alps]] home. The [[dwarves]] and [[elves]] of [[Uthodurn]] have adapted to their environment, becoming skilled hunters and trackers as well as hearty travelers used to persisting through extreme conditions. As the hunter's saying goes, "squeezing water from a stone might be hard, but snaring a rabbit from the Flots is harder." A strong martial force is necessary to combat dangers such as frost giant clans and snow-faring goblinoid bands that hunt throughout the slopes and caverns of the mountain range, and the masters of [[Uthodurn]] have trained fierce warriors and spellslingers.

The fiery volcano [[Kravaraad]] looms over the snow-covered [[Flotket Alps]], home of the [[Diarchy of Uthodurn]]

[[Uthodurn]] has the unique distinction of being the only place in [[Wildemount]] where dwarven and elven lifestyles and traditions come together within one location. The resulting collaborations have created incredible new crafts and means of circumventing the challenges of the region. Dwarven carving techniques blend with elven arcane knowledge to elevate architecture and excavation capabilities. Historical knowledge of the local vegetation meets refined herbalism to cultivate and grow cold-resistant crops. The crafting and smithing techniques of each lineage entwine and complement one another, making Uthodurnian goods that pass beyond the Greying Wildlands valuable indeed.

[[Dwarves]] and [[elves]] have lived together under the same roof and banner for centuries within [[Uthodurn]]. Over those years, they have forged ties of mutual respect, and romances and unions between [[elves]] and [[dwarves]] have also become increasingly common as the years progress. Though such partnerships were initially considered scandalous, they came to be met with tolerance, and eventually celebration. While an [[Elves|elf]] and [[Dwarves|dwarf]] may indeed produce offspring, the curiously stubborn nature of both ancestries produces a child that is either an [[Elves|elf]] or a [[Dwarves|dwarf]], though a child of either race often inherits minor physical attributes from the other parent. Such children are affectionately referred to as attalwen, or "two-hearted."

The [[Diarchy of Uthodurn]] rewards those who discover [[magic items]] in the wastes of [[Foren]], driving [[Uthodurn]]'s most experienced — and most desperate — explorers to [[Syrinlya]]. [[Uthodurn]] doesn't have the funds to support a full expedition in [[Foren]], so they provide incentives for citizens who gather such items. The city provides free transportation to and from [[Syrinlya]], in addition to rewarding discoveries, because they are desperate for items that could provide them with more resources, guard them from an invasion from the [[Dwendalian Empire]] or the [[Kryn Dynasty]], or help cure [[the corruption]] in the [[Savalirwood]]. A handful of scholars believe the source of the [[Savalirwood]]'s corruption might even be tied to something within the ruins of [[Aeor]].

The stronghold of [[Uthodurn]] is ruled by the dual monarchs, the [[Dwarves|dwarf]] Queen [[Simone Fruunast]] and the [[Elves|elf]] King [[Imathan Talviel]], who each oversee their own small council. Most matters of the city and its provinces are handled by these councils, and well-trained soldiers and rangers called [[Glassblades]] — named for their signature weapon design, which resembles jagged glass — act as enforcers of order and law.

[[Uthodurn]] society is far from perfect, and a seedy criminal element exists in the shadows under the mountain. Guildmasters who seek to surmount their rivals are known to resort to theft and bribery, while some honorless nobles have occasionally embraced the effectiveness of blackmail, and even murder, to gain power and wealth. Curious spies and thieves from [[Shadycreek Run]] have also sneaked or lied their way into the hearth-lit halls, and a small surge of crime might be imminent.

Above the entrance to [[Uthodurn]] stands a series of small watchtowers, which surround a cluster of livery stables that house thick-coated, hardy horses and cliffneck goats. The entire city is built around a vertical pit that descends straight down from a half-valley, with numerous tunnel doorways locked with cap-like iron doors, creating a wide, downward spiral of carved stone, ruddy iron, polished marble, and cold subterranean waterfalls lit by ever-burning pyres. The city's sections are divided and marked by sets of wide pillars that hold aloft steel gates that can be dropped to seal off entrances and defend the deeper regions of [[Uthodurn]].

The top level of the spiral, called the Volition Disc, is the widest and oldest of the regions. Many citizens live along the outer walls of the Volition Disc in a unique mishmash of old, angular stone abodes and lofty elven homesteads. The district is bisected by a central road called the Auger Trail, which is both a thoroughfare and a forum, lined by tables, benches, and peddlers' carts. Many construction businesses have small building yards here, while the upper, or Topper, mines work hard to pull iron from the surrounding rock. The main Glassblade barracks are centered around the entrance tunnels that descend into the city.

Below the Volition Disc, in a smaller spiral, lies the Deliberation Disc, or Liber Disc as it's often called. The Liber Disc is lined floor-to-ceiling with homes, emporiums, forges, and taverns that fill the air with the scents of cooked meats and boiling tubers. Many Uthodurnians come here to shop, enjoy the bustling atmosphere, or unwind with a hearty ale or piquant wine. Foreign travelers may be tickled to come across [[dwarves]] dancing to uncharacteristically whimsical elven music or [[elves]] enjoying dirty barroom games.

At the bottom of the city, the Grand Disc contains the Luddenbrock Mines that pull precious metals from the deeper veins of the mountain, as well as the Grandcast Citadel where the dual monarchs rule their people. The citadel itself is an impressive palace carved into the central stalactite pillars to resemble an inverse tower, with marble walls that make it look like a frozen, underground tornado.

Travel to and from [[Uthodurn]] is its own adventure, given the severity of the surrounding environment. The [[Glassblades]] might also turn to adventurers to help stem the rising tide of crime.

_**Awful Wails (Low Level).**_ The characters are hired by the [[Glassblades]] to investigate a series of murders. Ancient [[elves]], old enough to remember the destruction of [[Molaesmyr]], are withering and dying in the streets at night. Witnesses all report hearing the same thing before finding the bodies: a horrible wail. The culprit is Myra Quirn, an [[Elves|elf]] who was turned into a [banshee](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/banshee) when she was left behind as her people fled [[Molaesmyr]], and turned into a vengeful spirit by the dark magic of the ruins. After many years of searching, Myra found her still-living kin in [[Uthodurn]], and she plans to exact revenge on every last [[Elves|elf]] that left her behind.

_**Barren Shelves (Mid Level).**_ [[Uthodurn]]'s stock of food is running out as winter approaches. The monarchs sponsor a mammoth-hunting contest, offering a prize of 1,000 gp to the team that brings back the largest [mammoth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/mammoth). If the characters wish to partake, they must hunt and kill the largest mammoth possible, then deal with a rival crew of adventurers that tries to take their kill by force.

_**A Dreadful Bore (High Level).**_ The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] mount a daring incursion into [[Uthodurn]], using [purple worms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/purple-worm) to bore into the subterranean city. After breaching the outer wall of the Grand Disc, [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] invaders storm the Grandcast Citadel and hold both monarchs hostage after they're pinned down and unable to escape with their captives. The [[Glassblades]] turn to the adventurers for help freeing the monarchs and bringing the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] invaders to justice.
