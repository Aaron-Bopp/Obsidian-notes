### Far Hharom

**Location**:: [[Blightshore]]

Beyond the [[Ebonglass Massif]]'s hyaline peaks, a lonely expanse of moorland stretches northward toward the icy waters of the [[Frigid Depths]]. Though the landscape is drab and featureless, the peninsula known as Far Hharom is littered with the barrows of a long-forgotten barbarian people, who vanished centuries before [[the Calamity]] ravaged the [[Miskath Strand]]. Here and there, gelid bogs home to bizarre flora and fauna dot the landscape. And all around, an obstinate air of doom lingers among the peninsula's perpetual howling winds.

Far Hharom is a dangerous realm, even by [[Blightshore]]'s standards, and many suggest that the impasse formed by the [[Ebonglass Massif]] is actually a blessing in disguise. The only charted settlement in Far Hharom is an abandoned village on the rocky island west of the peninsula, known as [[Olc Skerry]] (described later in this chapter). Travelers have been known to camp amid the stony ruinsâ€”but these interlopers leave as soon as their affairs allow, typically preferring the haunted expanse of Far Hharom's open fells over the eerie isolation of [[Olc Skerry]]'s craggy shores.

The ancient burial mounds scattered across Far Hharom are rumored to be haunted by restless undead that were animated just as the arcane meddling of the Betrayer Gods reached its abominable zenith. Though the antiquities buried within Far Hharom's ancient barrows promise considerable wealth to those who would plunder their lightless depths, few excavators of these accursed places actually live to tell the tale.

#### Domains of the Deep Ones

There are rumors of a frightening clan of amphibious humanoids who dwell along the icy northern shores of Far Hharom. The stories speak of a hoary clan of pale, degenerate folk who pay fealty to dark, arctic demigods in the form of warm-blooded sacrifices. Some believe the [[Ebonglass Massif]] was erected by the Betrayer Gods to keep these strange and sinister people at bay, while others report to have seen raiding parties of scaly Far Hharom monstrosities as far south as the [[Cauldron Sea]].

The northern peninsula of [[Blightshore]] is a remote and unwelcoming place, but characters in search of secret histories and treasured lore will find it most inviting.
