### Silberquel Ridge
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

The imposing mountain range known as the Silberquel Ridge extends across the middle of [[Western Wynandir]], dividing the [[Marrow Valley]] from the [[Pearlbow Wilderness]]. A range of jagged mountain tops visible from most cities in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]], the Silberquel Ridge is an important landmark, but it is best known for its seemingly endless cache of rich metals and deep caverns. The ore and gems mined here provided [[Rexxentrum]] with most of its wealth and funded the rise of the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. The surface veins are the largest source of silver in [[Wildemount]], but the deeper paths reveal other precious metals, gems, and forgotten remnants of pre-[[Divergence]] curiosities â€” and many deadly beasts that have come to call those ancient corners home.

Traveling across the Silberquel Ridge is its own adventure, given the number of dangerous creatures that inhabit the region's mountains and tunnels. Caravans, miners, and prospectors hire adventurers to guard them as they travel and work in the mountains.
