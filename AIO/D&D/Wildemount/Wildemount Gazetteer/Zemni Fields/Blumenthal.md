### Blumenthal
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/ZemniFields
**Location**:: [[Zemni Fields]]

**Population**:: 3,850 (71% [[humans]], 12% [[dwarves]], 11% [[elves]], 6% other [[races]])

**Government**:: [[Starosta]] Judus Olessia is the appointed leader of Blumenthal, but the countless directives from [[Rexxentrum]] often bypass him entirely.

**Defense**:: A respectable cadre of [[Crownsguard]] and a small body of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers keep the farmsteads of Blumenthal safe.

**Commerce**:: While food, produce, and basic supplies are available, little else can be found since most trade heads straight to the capital.

**Organizations**:: A temple to [[Pelor]] stands vigil over the heart of the farmland. The farming guilds all work under the strict expectations of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]].

A sprawling collection of rural farmsteads connected by administration buildings, Blumenthal is [[Rexxentrum]]'s main source of produce and meat. Numerous government-owned fields and orchards harvest cold-weather crops and livestock, and families chosen to tend to the land are paid by [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] to gather their goods and deliver them to the gates of the capital. Some who till the land are frustrated that they don't own their plots outright, but with generational incentives for those who keep to the family plot like their ancestors, others see it as investment toward eventually living in greater comfort than the typical farmer.

As [[Rexxentrum]]'s survival depends on Blumenthal's fields, [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] has erected dozens of [[Crownsguard]] watchtowers at the corner farmers' plots to watch for thieves, scavengers, and monstrous predators. The people of Blumenthal can't help but feel the watchful eye of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]] on them at all times, looming over their work and dampening their spirits. Yet even in such troubled times, [[Starosta]] Judus Olessia works directly with Argonomist [[June Wiston]] to improve the lives of the hard-working farmers who support the success of Blumenthal â€” and thus of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

Since Blumenthal's fields are critical to the survival of the people of [[Rexxentrum]], adventurers might be hired by the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] to investigate disappearing or dying animals or crops, or to stop monster raids from the [[Silberquel Ridge]]. Adventurers who work for the [[Kryn Dynasty]] could be asked to destroy crops or poison goods headed for [[Rexxentrum]].
