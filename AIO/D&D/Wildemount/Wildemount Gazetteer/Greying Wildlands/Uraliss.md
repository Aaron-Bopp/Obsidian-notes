### Uraliss
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/GreyingWildlands
**Location**:: [[Greying Wildlands]]

The small town of Uraliss was [[Uthodurn]]'s first attempt to expand beyond its mountain halls. Uraliss was settled with the intent of becoming a farming village to aid in crop production. As the town began construction, arcane wards were developed and placed along a patch of snow-covered field at the base of the [[Flotket Alps]]. The wards were designed to slowly melt the snow and hopefully help develop the area into farmable land. However, the town was beset by [[orcs]] and other threats from the [[Rime Plains]], and the town's hopes were further crushed when the land beneath the snow was found to be rocky and untillable. The settlement was quickly abandoned and is now a crumbling ghost town left to be vandalized and repurposed by the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] of the [[Rime Plains]].

Characters might go to Uraliss to retrieve something left behind, study its arcane wards, or hunt a beast that lurks in the ghost town.
