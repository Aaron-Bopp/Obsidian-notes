### Fortress of the Dead Jarl
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Eiselcross
**Location**:: [[Eiselcross]]

From the outside, the Fortress of the Dead Jarl is an enormous fairy-tale castle made entirely of ice. The horrors inside the place tell a different story. The frost giant leader, Jarl Conessa Berg, was obsessed with gathering objects from [[Aeor]]. Two centuries ago, one of those items turned Conessa and every giant within her castle into an undead zombie. These beings are trapped inside the castle along with a hoard of [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items.

The [[Aeor|Aeorian]] items within the fortress are enough to tempt most adventurers, but there are other reasons to go to the fortress.
