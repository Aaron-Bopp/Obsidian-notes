The community of Palma Flora occupies the southern tip of the Vezdali Peninsula, and is a favorite vacation destination for merchants and [[Zhelezo]] from nearby [[Port Damali]]. While this settlement is small, it's famous for its annual shark hunting tournament and a popular cocktail that bears the settlement's name.

Most tourists are familiar with Flora Isle, which is home to the port and a shimmering beach. Most vacationers stay in the Riptide Inn and Tavern, sipping on fruity drinks while watching the shark hunters practice on the southern shore. The island is separated from the rest of the peninsula by a wide channel spanned by a wooden bridge. Most residents of Palma Flora live and work in the northern half of the settlement and retire to the southern island after a hard day's work.

Though Palma Flora is the perfect place for a vacation, it's not without trouble.
