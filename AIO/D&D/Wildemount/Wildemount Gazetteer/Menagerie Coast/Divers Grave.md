### Diver's Grave
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast
**Location**:: [[Menagerie Coast]]

Deep beneath the waves of the open Lucidian Ocean lies a terrifying graveyard of wrecked, merrow-infested ships scattered across the ocean floor. This sunken cemetery of broken vessels is strewn over miles and miles, and each salvage ship that tries to reclaim cargo from the Diver's Grave only adds another corpse to its hungry sands. The Grave seems to sense ships as they approach and sends out a storm to consume them. At the heart of the Grave is an underwater maze of carnivorous seaweed, and within this dread labyrinth lives Dashilla the Dreadful, a terrible [sea fury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/sea-fury) (see [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-bestiary#SeaFury "chapter 7")) who hungrily awaits her next shipment of wayward sailors.
