### Darktow
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MenagerieCoast
**Location**:: [[Menagerie Coast]]

**Population**:: 1,306 (61% [[humans]], 12% [[elves]], 9% [[dwarves]], 18% other [[races]])

**Government**:: The island is ruled by [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]], whose power is maintained through the pirate lords loyal to him.

**Defense**:: Numerous hidden ballistae, siege weapons, explosives, and magical wards guard the waterway to the city. The harbor holds a powerful navy of pirate vessels, and most Darktow denizens are accomplished cutthroats, ready to fight any threat to their city.

**Commerce**:: Most goods and services can be found here, as well as all kinds of rare, exotic, and dangerous supplies that find their way here from far-off raids.

**Organizations**:: Most homesteads have small personal shrines, but only two rickety temples to [[Kord]] and [[Melora]] stand along the shoreline. Each ship is its own independent organization, but all work as part of Darktow's community.

This eerie, fog-shrouded town is built into the southern cliff of [[Darktow Isle]]. Over a century ago, Darktow was established as a sanctuary for sailors traveling to [[Wildemount]] from [[Marquet]] or [[Tal'Dorei]]. About forty years ago, a group of aggrieved sailors and traders within the [[Clovis Concord]] rebelled against their government's excessive taxation of independent nautical businesses. The rebellious pirates conquered Darktow and claimed it as their headquarters, making this town the beating heart of piracy in the Lucidian Ocean. This union of thieves and pirates, known as [[The Revelry]], plunders ships on the surrounding waters then retreats to their reef-encircled base, amassing wealth and influence through intimidation and cleverness.

#### By Land or Sea

While most [[The Revelry|Revelry]] pirates are sailors by trade, many of the isle's residents never take to sea. Instead, they maintain the town's defenses, repair ships in port, entertain pirates on shore leave, or sell goods and services. A large number of these landlocked folk were denizens at the time of the town's capture or are their descendants, having been granted safety in exchange for their allegiance to [[The Revelry]].

Within [[The Revelry]], each captain is the lord of their own ship, but all business must be reported to [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]], the leader of [[The Revelry]] as a whole. Though [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]] rarely leaves the Throne Roost in the town of Darktow, he oversees operations, organizes raids, protects the island, and punishes traitors.

One would think a landscape of law-breakers would be rife with crime, but the rule of [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]] heavily punishes thievery within Darktow. A number of bird-picked skulls adorn the rocky shore aside his lair as a warning to play nice with one's fellow pirates. Even so, some folks do push those boundaries should they feel confident in their ability to get away with it. Theft and conflict beyond the boundaries of the Dragshallow Reef is reviewed and judged by [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]].

The town's many ramshackle structures sprawl across numerous rock shelves and caverns, connected by bridges, tunnels, and rickety platforms. A vast shipyard surrounds the southern cliffs with a winding network of docks and bridges, while other fortifications bristle with cannons. Other siege weapons dot the jagged edges of the isle.

A series of watchtowers keeps vigil over the inlet, their torches flickering within the midnight fog. A precarious, winding cliffside stair leads to the Throne Roost, the cavern where [[Wyatt Maranoss|the Plank King]] makes his home. Atop that same cliff, a mysterious arcane device is under construction; some believe that it is intended to defend [[The Revelry]]'s stronghold in case some fool from the [[Clovis Concord]] attempts to bring a skyship over their heads.
