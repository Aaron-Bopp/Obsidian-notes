Tussoa began as a Ki'Nau freshwater fishing village along the Tyodan River, but it has grown into a respectable city in the centuries following the creation of the [[Clovis Concord]]. The central district where the two main streets of the city meet has larger, more modern structures and bustling streets, but the outer regions are still dominated by humble homes of river reeds and straw.

Tussoa boasts a more relaxed way of life than most of the other coastal cities. Its people try to live a simple life, unburdened by business or politics, but they still grapple with issues of cultural identity. Tussoa's most immediate problems are the threats of the natural world that menace this frontier city on a daily basis.

The competing Majest and Regver timber guilds are the leading suppliers of lumber to [[Port Damali]]. They work along the [[Copia Wildwood]] and send their trunks down the Tyodan to their mills at the port, usually accompanied by hired hands to protect their goods. Because the prime logging sites of the forest are hotly contested and not overseen by the [[Zhelezo]], both guilds hire mercenaries to guard their work and clear out nearby monsters stalking the shadows of the wood.

Marquis Tusila Latu currently directs the rule of law in Tussoa, taking particular pride in her Ki'Nau heritageâ€”and the Ki'Nau heritage of her people and her city. The marquis treats her [[Zhelezo]] and constituents well, eager to build loyalty in a time of creeping [[The Myriad|Myriad]] interests. Marquis Tusila insists on being involved in all trials where life and death are concerned and is renowned as a champion of justice, unlike her corrupt predecessor, Marquis Maros du Simmas.

Try as the marquis might, the comparatively rural location and understaffed [[Zhelezo]] of Tussoa make the city a breeding ground for petty thieves, charlatans, and forgers. Independent crime rings operate in small bursts, then halt their work for weeks or months to cover their tracks. There are some thugs within the city with connections to [[The Myriad]], but their current intention is to watch and wait until the time is right.

Laid out in the shape of a large V, this bustling fishing city of lively docks and a hard-working populace is spread out over two main roads that meet at the northeast edge, with numerous smaller roads connecting the major thoroughfares. The northern road is Pulum Road, and most of the city's shops, inns, and storage houses are kept to the road's eastern edge, interspersed with neighborhoods made up of simple shacks. The southwestern road is Vaigvasa Road, built along the edge of the Tyodan River. Here, more homes and businesses fill the inner regions, while fishing huts and river logging stations line the southern, outer side. The two roads meet at the Lotoe Plaza, home to the Olo, the repurposed temple to Uk'otoa that now acts as the court of the marquis. All holidays and celebrations are centered in the Lotoe Plaza, which is known to become crowded enough with people on such days that the streets can barely be seen.

Tussoa's bustling logging industry, minimal presence of [[Zhelezo]], and location near the [[Copia Wildwood]] make it an excellent place for urban adventures to overlap with wilderness expeditions.
