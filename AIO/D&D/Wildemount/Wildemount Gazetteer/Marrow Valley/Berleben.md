**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley
**Location**:: [[Marrow Valley]]

**Population**:: 3,230 (63% [[humans]], 17% [[halflings]], 12% [[gnomes]], 8% other [[races]])

**Government**:: [[Starosta]] Carliyle Vesperwind has left most of the governing to [[idolmaster]] Julienne Droogba and other community figures.

**Defense**:: Though a bare-bones garrison of [[Crownsguard]] guards the town, [[sellswords]] protect travelers within the Labenda Swamp.

**Commerce**:: Supplies beyond basic goods and tools are uncommon. A handful of meager inns provide limited lodging.

**Organizations**:: The [[idolmaster]] maintains the small shrines within the city. Local business is thriving, but few outsiders are willing to invest in this lopsided backwater.

Near the green waters of the [[Ounterloch]], the marsh town of Berleben is nestled deep in the Labenda Swamp. Berleben was settled early in the expansion of the [[Dwendalian Empire]], and the town initially showed promise with a booming industry in the cultivation of unique swamp plants sought after by healers and mages alike. However, the watershed from the Silberquel Mountains runs into the Labenda Swamp, and the land slowly grew unstable, causing half of the town to begin sinking into the surrounding marsh. Those who remained in the town have had to adapt over the years, as much of the settlement now sits uncomfortably under inches of swamp water.

Other regions of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] regard Berleben with distaste and ridicule, colored by exaggerated stories of rampant illness, a perpetual plague of buzzing insects, and the failing landscape it was built on. Berleben is sometimes call "the Sog Sticks," a moniker used by outsiders to ridicule the town and by its denizens with sarcastic pride.

The ragged [[swampfolk]] that call this place home have remained due to familial ties, impoverished necessity, or the promise of work harvesting what natural commodities the swamp offers. The dangers of the swamp and the isolated location have bred a tight-knit and nosy community. Neighbors frequently pry in each other's business, aggressive curiosity taking hold whenever something new or out-of-the-ordinary occurs within the murky streets.

Atop [[the Stilts]] region of the settlement lies the Summit House, home to [[Starosta]] Carliyle Vesperwind. Vesperwind greatly despises his assignment and quietly resents his inability to protest his appointment. He spends most of his time locked within his abode or traveling to neighboring locales to avoid responsibility. The governance of the town is mostly left in the hands of the Mossmire Temple's [[idolmaster]], Julienne Droogba.

Without an active [[starosta]] or a well-staffed [[Crownsguard]], crime in Berleben is fairly common and rarely punished. Most folk who live within the town carry their own means of self-defense and are slow to trust outsiders.

Built over unsteady, stinking swampland, the somewhat miserable and half-sunken town is divided into thirds. The three districts correspond to different ages of construction in the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and visually differ based on whatever construction materials the townsfolk had access to at the time.

![[The Puddles]]

Berleben is an all-but-lawless settlement that needs heroes to help keep the peace. Likewise, it is a wonderful place for unscrupulous [[sellswords]], since no one takes notice of petty crime.
