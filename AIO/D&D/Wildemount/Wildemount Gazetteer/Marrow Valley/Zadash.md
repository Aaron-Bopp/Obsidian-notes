### Zadash
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley
**Location**:: [[Marrow Valley]]

**Population**:: 89,210 (70% [[humans]], 11% [[halflings]], 9% [[dwarves]], 10% other [[races]])

**Government**:: [[Starosta Wyatt Fedar]] is the city's nominal leader, but nothing gets done without the assent of the lawmaster, other Crown-appointed officials, and the wealthy elite.

**Defense**:: An impressive host of [[Crownsguard]] is integrated throughout the city, while a sizable legion of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers is stationed within the Signet Ramparts. Political figures and nobles also employ personal guards.

**Commerce**:: Nearly all goods and services are available in Zadash, including [[magic items]]. Illegal imports and contraband are found in underground circles.

**Organizations**:: Major temples to [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]-approved gods are scattered throughout the city. The [[Cerberus Assembly]] holds great sway, as do the high nobility and the guildmasters. [[The Myriad]], once thought banished, is still deeply entrenched in the city's businesses.

Zadash was the capital of the [[Julous Dominion]] before it was conquered by the [[Dwendalian Empire]] nearly two centuries ago. Now the city is the central crossroads of the southern region of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]] and a smaller sister city to the capital of [[Rexxentrum]]. Zadash accommodates heavy traffic through its winding streets, serving noble diplomats, countless trade caravans, and rushing messengers from all across [[Western Wynandir]] and the [[Menagerie Coast]]. The city's ruling class is comprised of powerful merchant lords and ladies who oversee the guilds that control the markets throughout the city.

Zadash is a bastion of law, civilization, and military might in the [[Marrow Valley]], whose small townships often escape imperial scrutiny. The city is home to the Hall of Erudition, an extension of the [[Soltryce Academy]] and foothold of power for the [[Cerberus Assembly]]. As a common waypoint for travelers to and from [[Rexxentrum]], the city offers many forms of entertainment and recreation. It also boasts the largest military force in the southern end of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

The majority of day-to-day business and politics are overseen by [[Starosta Wyatt Fedar]], [[Lawmaster Orentha Stonegrasp]], and [[High Richter Dolan Thyme]], who must work closely to manage the large, sprawling city. However, it is common knowledge that the [[starosta]] is deep in the pockets of the city's wealthiest families, and is often manipulated by those powers without the people's best interests at heart. Community leaders are rightfully furious about the [[starosta]]'s corruption, but [[Starosta]] Wyatt is finding it difficult to gain support from the capital, which is focused on the war with [[Xhorhas]]. The growing hum of unrest makes him increasingly nervous.

Criminal elements are part of the very fabric of the city. Independent swindlers make their way through the poorer districts, pickpocketing freely behind the backs of overworked [[Crownsguard]]. [[The Myriad]] has patsies in every industry and most political offices, too.

A crime boss known in some circles as [[the Gentleman]] runs a thieves' guild based in a network of underground tunnels called the Underworks. Crime is extremely profitable in Zadash, and has been fine-tuned for generations to be efficient, hard to trace, and largely invisible to the untrained eye.

Zadash has a mix of older Julous architecture and modern [[Dwendalian Empire|Dwendalian]] construction, giving the picturesque, triangular city a varied and mismatched look. Zadash is broken into five major districts: [[the Outersteads]], [[the Pentamarket]], [[the Innerstead Sprawl]], [[the Tri-Spires]], and [[the Signet Wall]].

As a large city full of travelers, criminals, and politicians, Zadash has plenty of opportunities for adventure.
