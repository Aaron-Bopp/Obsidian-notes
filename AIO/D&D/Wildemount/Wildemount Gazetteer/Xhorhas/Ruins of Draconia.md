At the bottom of the deep [[Dreemoth Ravine]] lie the crumbled ruins of the once-proud nation of Ruins of [[Draconia]]. The floating islands of the city-state were the original home of [[dragonborn]] society within [[Wildemount]], though the ruling class installed a strict caste system and forced the tailless [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] [[dragonborn]] to labor in the ravine below their magically elevated island city. When the city was assaulted by [[The Chroma Conclave]] two decades before, the islands were sundered and fell into the ravine, killing many of the inhabitants. However, this disaster gave the ravenites a chance to rebel against their cruel masters.

The plundered ruins of the former city are now abandoned heaps of rock and rubble, a dismal memorial to the ignominious end of a glorious, cruel civilization.

The ravenites did have allies among the ruling houses. Many Draconian citizens disagreed with the oppression of their brethren and fought for generations to overturn the laws that kept them enslaved. Others aided the ravenites in their emancipation after the fall of Ruins of [[Draconia]]; those folk came out on top in the end, for they're considered honored members of the emerging [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] society.

Those champions who were lost in the struggle are immortalized in statues left among the ruins, the most famous of whom is the hero Tiberius Stormwind of Ruins of [[Draconia]]. Tiberius was one of the legendary heroes of Vox Machina, and he gave his life to defend ravenites from the ire of Vorugal, the white [[dragon]] of [[The Chroma Conclave]]. His statue and surrounding shrine are a place of pilgrimage for [[Dragonborn|ravenite]] historians.
