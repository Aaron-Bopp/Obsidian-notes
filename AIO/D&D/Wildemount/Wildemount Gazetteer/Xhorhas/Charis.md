### Charis
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

**Population**:: 950 (53% [[dragonborn]], 41% [[halflings]], 6% other [[races]])

**Government**:: Two elders preside over this village, one representing its [[dragonborn]] population and the other representing its [[Halflings|halfling]] population.

**Defense**:: Numerous bands of experienced fighters, druids, and hunters patrol the area. Civilians know basic combat techniques to defend the village if necessary.

**Commerce**:: Travelers can find basic supplies, most likely at a small inn. Visits from traveling merchants are infrequent, so rare goods are special finds.

**Organizations**:: A mighty treetop temple to [[Melora]] shades the center of the village.

A wandering community of [[halflings]] survived in the fiend-twisted [[Lotusden Greenwood]] for generations through their cunning and the grace of their faith in [[Melora]]. When they found themselves ambushed by a group of starving ravenites fleeing from the destruction of [[Draconia]], the [[halflings]] shunned conflict in favor of kindness. They offered to feed the ravenites, and a bond between peoples was born.

This burgeoning community of [[halflings]] and [[dragonborn]] was able to carve out a permanent home within a safer region of the Lotusden and, with the blessing of the Wild Mother, ward off the evils of the forest. They gave their woodland village the name Charis, from the [[Draconic]] word for "hope." This hidden hamlet of hollowed trees, moss-covered grottoes, and mushroom fields harbors a nature-worshiping commune of vegetarian farmers, forest guardians, and druids who work to live in harmony with the surrounding forest. They hope to cleanse the Lotusden of the evils that have pervaded its shadows since before the [[Divergence]].

Despite the chaos and turmoil that rock the lands of [[Wildemount]] beyond the [[Lotusden Greenwood]], the people of Charis are happy in their isolation. Lacking any real interest in outside affairs, they focus entirely on protecting the surrounding forest and their fellow villagers. Outsiders occasionally visit Charis, and while the villagers are welcoming to those who offer no sign of aggression, they usually find a way to quickly usher them along, preferring to be left to their simple lives and pursuits. The people of this village would never consider leaving their tranquil home, unless so commanded by the Wild Mother herself.

The community is small enough that most intricacies of formal government are unnecessary. Volunteers take up responsibilities in shifts, from keeping watch to gathering food. Leaderships is shared between two elders, one for each of the [[Halflings|halfling]] and [[dragonborn]] populations, and their authority is mostly required for giving spiritual guidance and resolving minor disputes.

The society within the village operates without money, gold, or emphasis on precious stones. Everything is provided by the community and shared equally, in theory. In practice, however, disputes do occasionally arise, and ravenites who remember their times in the [[Dreemoth Ravine]] sometimes feel compelled to secretly hoard things once considered valuable. While there are no formal laws, if enough citizens feel wronged by an action, they bring the issue before the elders, who will judge the situation and choose a fitting punishment.

Nestled within a sunken meadow surrounded by dense trees and hills, this hidden sanctuary is a beautiful pocket of protected nature within the haunted shadows of the Lotusden. Colorful flowers and fungi line the pathways between stacking treehollow homes and hillside domiciles, and vine-wrapped bridges hang between treetops. Sunbeams pierce the canopy of the forest, bringing vibrant warmth during the day, while moonlight calls faint whispers of mischievous fey into the village to mingle with its denizens.

Finding Charis is an adventure the characters might undertake to locate a person with a specific item or piece of information that could aid them in another quest.
