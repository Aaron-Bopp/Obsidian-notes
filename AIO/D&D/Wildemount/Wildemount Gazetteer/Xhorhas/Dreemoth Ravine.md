### Dreemoth Ravine
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

Along the southeastern range of the [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], an impressively deep gorge cuts into the mountains for nearly eighty miles. Winding and widening, the enormous ravine reveals a beautiful, rocky valley of sparse trees, natural caverns, and incredible waterfalls tumbling from the Ashkeeper runoff. Strong winds blow through the gorge, and the numerous natural cliffside outcroppings provide shelter for wild griffons, wyverns, and other flying beasts. The central bend of the Dreemoth Ravine still contains the [[Ruins of Draconia]], as well as the countless abandoned caves and quarries that once held the enslaved [[Dragonborn|ravenites]], now freed.

Characters might come to Dreemoth Ravine to capture and train a flying mount, or to explore the [[Ruins of Draconia]].
