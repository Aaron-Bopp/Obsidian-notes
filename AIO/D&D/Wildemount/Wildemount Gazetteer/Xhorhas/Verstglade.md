### Verstglade
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas
**Location**:: [[Xhorhas]]

A small valley of crooked, leafless trees is hidden in the tallest peaks of the southern [[Ashkeeper Peaks]], though few know of its existence. During the [[Age of Arcanum]], this dark and menacing wood once was an experimental playground for the terrible lich [[Vecna]], where he would manipulate and twist all manner of life, arcana, and undead to his sick whims. The countless years of misuse left the withered forest corrupt and overrun with nightmarish abominations and cursed, undying minions who were abandoned to their madness. Mercifully, [[Vecna]] was banished before he could unleash his creations on [[Wildemount]], and his aspirations for godhood left his intended plots with Verstglade forgotten.

Verstglade is filled with forgotten experiments that characters might be asked to retrieve or destroy.
