**Level**:: High Level

 One of the most trusted allies of [[Prime Arbiter]] [[Sydnock Truscan]], Doctor Reynold Brueska, has been privately developing an arcane disease to be used in the war against the [[Kryn Dynasty]], with the sanatorium's patients as his test subjects. When all contact with the sanatorium ceases, the [[Prime Arbiter]] hires the characters to investigate the premises and uncover the doctor, his work, and the events that transpired. The characters discover that a majority of the denizens of the [[Vergesson Sanatorium]] have been mutated and driven mad by the disease. The adventurers must fight their way through the horror-filled halls while trying to avoid contamination, or discover a cure before the disease completely corrupts them.
