#### Lost Resting Place (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Iothia Moorland]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 A disorganized clan of [cyclopes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/cyclops) wander the moorland, searching for the grave of their founding champion who died hundreds of years ago. They might parlay with the characters and are willing to trade fine, rare items for aid in seeking out their champion's resting place. When the grave is discovered, the cyclopes immediately begin a ceremony that raises the bones of their founder from the muck into a new existence as a giant. The characters can decide to halt the ritual, angering the cyclopes, or learn later that the clan is terrorizing the tribes of the moorland.
