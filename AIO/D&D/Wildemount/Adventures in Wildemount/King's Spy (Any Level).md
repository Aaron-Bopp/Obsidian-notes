**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Shadycreek Run]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 Nella Durlon (lawful neutral, nonbinary, [[Humans|human]] [spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/spy)) lives in [[Shadycreek Run]] as a spy for the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]]. They gather information about the settlement's defenses to take back to Oliver Schrieber (see "[Dwendalian Empire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/factions-and-societies#DwendalianEmpire "[[Dwendalian Empire]]")" in [[chapter 2]]). The characters learn of Nella's job from a faction that hires them to find the spy. Depending on the faction, the characters must either escort Nella safely out of the settlement so they can report to Oliver, or ask that Nella be killed for giving away the settlement's secrets. Either way, finding Nella is no small task. The spy is a master of their craft and blends in with the criminals and ruffians of the Run.
