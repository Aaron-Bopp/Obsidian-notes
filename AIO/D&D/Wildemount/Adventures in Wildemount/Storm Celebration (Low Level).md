#### Storm Celebration (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Boroftkrah]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 When lightning splits the sky, the [[Boroftkrah]] [[orcs]] honor [[Kord]] with competitive games that last until the storm breaks. Characters who have earned the [[orcs]]' trust might find themselves volunteered as participants or judges during such a time. Meanwhile, an [orc eye of Gruumsh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc-eye-of-[[gruumsh]]) leads a band of [orc](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orc) and [orog](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/orog) warriors who have secretly begun worshiping the Ruiner. They plan to display their faith during the contest by turning the games into a bloodbath, hoping to convert other [[orcs]] with the promise of glorious bloodshed, and murder any who resist.
