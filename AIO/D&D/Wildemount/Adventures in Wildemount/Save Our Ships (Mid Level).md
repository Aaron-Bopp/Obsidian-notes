#### Save Our Ships (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Vurmas]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 While the characters are aboard one of [[Vurmas]]'s boats, three [[wildfolk]] [druids](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/druid), each riding on the back of a [killer whale](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/killer-whale), attack the boats. The druids are angry that [[wildfolk]] are leaving [[Eiselcross]] in droves to go to [[Xhorhas]]. They believe that the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] are using enchantment magic against these [[wildfolk]], tricking them into leaving their friends and family. The druids use hit-and-run tactics, dealing as much damage as possible before fleeing. Captain Hallwas Denalor asks the characters to deal with the attackers. The druids could be open to negotiation, or they might fight with their dying breath for their beliefs.
