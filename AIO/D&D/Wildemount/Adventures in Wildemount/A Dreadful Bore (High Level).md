 The [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] mount a daring incursion into [[Uthodurn]], using [purple worms](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/purple-worm) to bore into the subterranean city. After breaching the outer wall of the Grand Disc, [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] invaders storm the Grandcast Citadel and hold both monarchs hostage after they're pinned down and unable to escape with their captives. The [[Glassblades]] turn to the adventurers for help freeing the monarchs and bringing the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] invaders to justice.
