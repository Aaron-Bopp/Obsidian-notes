#### The Krakenwhacker (High Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Rotthold]]
**Level**:: High Level

 Captain Veluna Samarshan of the galley _Krakenwhacker_ has decided to retire in [[Rotthold]]. Having heard about the adventurers' exploits, she offers to sell the _Krakenwhacker_ to them for one gold piece, though they'll need to find their own crew. The ship is in excellent condition and has a magical figurehead carved in the likeness of [[Bahamut]] that grants the vessel immunity to fire, lightning, and thunder damage. The ship is the envy of several other [[The Revelry|Revelry]] captains, and the characters might have to fend off their advances to keep it. Captain Samarshan also warns them about an [adult bronze dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/adult-bronze-[[dragon]]) named Walarkus. Corrupted by the magic of [[Blightshore]], this once-noble [[dragon]] has become a coastal menace consumed by greed. It would like nothing more than to add the ship's magical figurehead to its undersea trove.
