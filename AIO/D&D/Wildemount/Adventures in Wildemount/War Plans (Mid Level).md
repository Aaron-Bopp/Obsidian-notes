 The characters are hired by [[The Myriad]] or the [[Kryn Dynasty]] to intercept imperial documents as they travel from [[Rexxentrum]] to [[Zadash]]. The first courier takes the documents as far as the crossroads before handling them off to a second courier. Both couriers are [knights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/knight) of the [[Crownsguard]] mounted on [warhorses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/warhorse). The documents are war plans bearing magical wards and the seal of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the king]].
