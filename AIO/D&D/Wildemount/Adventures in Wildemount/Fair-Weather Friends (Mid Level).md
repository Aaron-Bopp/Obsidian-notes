#### Fair-Weather Friends (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Crystalsands Tundra]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 While crossing the wind-swept snow dunes, the characters encounter three young [remorhazes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/remorhaz) that do not attack. They are instead following Shwells (chaotic neutral, female, [[Gnomes|gnome]] [scout](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/scout)), who wields a recently scavenged pale, blue orb that keeps the creatures docile. She will not part with the orb and has grown attached to her monstrous companions, but characters with arcane knowledge will notice the orb is drawing more remorhazes to it from all across the tundra, and the magic that subdues the creatures appears to be rapidly fading.
