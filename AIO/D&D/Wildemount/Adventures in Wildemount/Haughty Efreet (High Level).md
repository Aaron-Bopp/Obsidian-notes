 A pair of [efreet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/efreeti) recently emerged from the [[River Inferno]], and the characters are the first intelligent creatures they find. Using [tongues](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/tongues) spells, the efreet demand that the characters tell them everything they know about this strange land, then demand that the characters point them in the direction of the nearest settlement. The efreet plan to enslave the settlement's inhabitants and put them to work building an obsidian tower on the shore of the [[River Inferno]], where the efreet can stay whenever they deign to visit this dismally cold corner of the multiverse.
