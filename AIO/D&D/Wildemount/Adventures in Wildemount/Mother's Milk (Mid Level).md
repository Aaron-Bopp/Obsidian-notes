**Level**:: Mid Level

 Someone or something has been kidnapping the infants and children of [[Charis]]. A terrible evil lurks at the heart of the matter: an unholy coven of hags, led by a [night hag](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/night-hag) of prodigious influence and power. The hag preside over a dark corner of the Greenwood, where they lair beneath the roots of a gargantuan tree. Here, the nightmarish coven and its minions manufacture the slow doom of the Greenwood itself as they siphon the lifeblood of the [[Charis]] children into a loathsome artifact known as the Gloom Lathe.
