#### Vine Shine (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Nicodranas]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 Overnight, heavy vines grow over the lighthouse of the Wild Mother, and anyone who cuts their way through to investigate the sacred place doesn't return. The characters are hired to investigate and find an infestation of [vine blights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vine-blight) in the temple. How did the blights come to be? Are they part of a plan to corrupt the lighthouse for dark purposes, or are they a priest's experiment gone terribly wrong?
