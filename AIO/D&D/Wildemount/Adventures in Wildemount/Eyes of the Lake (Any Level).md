#### Eyes of the Lake (Any Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Fevergulf Lake]]
**Level**:: Any Level

 The two islands near the center of the Fevergulf, known as the Eyes of the Lake, are home to rocky shores and twin forests of brown, moss-covered, dead trees. Tall, twisted, and leafless, these woods are ominous enough from a distance, but the clans of the [[Iothia Moorland]] still tell fables of a strange, isolated [[Cults in Wildemount|cult]] from long ago that lives there to this day, mourning the loss of some long-forgotten god.
