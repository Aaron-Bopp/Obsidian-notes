#### Treantwatch (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Savalirwood]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 While traveling through the forest, the characters encounter a [treant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant) who insists on guiding them safely through the [[Savalirwood]]. The treant claims to know every nook and cranny in the forest, as well as its dangers. On the surface, it seems very helpful. However, the curse afflicting the forest has driven the treant mad and made it delusional. All the dangers it describes are inventions of its twisted mind, and it has a knack for leading the characters into one perilous situation after another.
