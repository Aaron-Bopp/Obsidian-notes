 Hidden among the shallow chasms of ice is the lair of Yondis the Winter Star, an [androsphinx](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/androsphinx) with pure white fur. It watches over the tomb of a heroic group of champions who sacrificed themselves in the final battles of [[the Calamity]]. Those who wish to claim the arms and instruments of these legendary figures must prove their worth to Yondis through numerous quests or challenges â€” and the sphinx has no mercy for those who fail.
