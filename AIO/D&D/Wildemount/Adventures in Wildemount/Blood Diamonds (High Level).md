**Location**:: [[Othemoor]]
**Level**:: High Level

 When several diamonds are revealed by the shifting of [[Othemoor]]'s muck, many adventurers, including the characters, head for the swamp, hoping to strike it rich. The diamonds were actually planted by Pillia Ravenosa, a [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire), to bring prey into the [[Othemoor]] for her [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/vampire-spawn).
