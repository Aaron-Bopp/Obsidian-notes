#### Grain Hijackers (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Trostenwald]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters are hired by one of the brewing families to find out who tore into their silo and stole their grain. The characters might suspect one of the other brewing families, but that notion is quickly dashed when a second family's silo is similarly vandalized. The true culprits behind these attacks are two [owlbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/owlbear) that meet each night and devour grain from a new silo as part of a courtship ritual.
