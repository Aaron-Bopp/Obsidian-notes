**Level**:: Epic Level

 The extremely rare double eclipse, when the moons Catha and Ruidis overlap before the sun, is approaching, and it will occur over [[Xhorhas]]. Seers and oracles warn of portents that speak of an uncontrollable planar crossover, where multiple planes might briefly collide. The [[Kryn Dynasty]] hires the characters to bolster their ranks in preparationâ€”but no one is prepared for the army from the Nine Hells that invades the fields when the realms merge. Leading this evil army is a [pit fiend](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/pit-fiend) named Vanatoth.
