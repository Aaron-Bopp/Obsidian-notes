**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters encounter a traveling textile merchant named Cardorn Brentahill (neutral evil, male, [[Humans|human]] [noble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/noble)), who lives in [[Yrrosa]]. He's seeking bodyguards to help him escort his cart back to his home, paying 100 gp per hired hand. Along the journey, the characters and their employer are attacked by a crew of mercenaries representing the Durrodan family, claiming that Cardorn stole silk worms from their silk farm. Cardorn offers to increase the characters' pay if they defend him. If they side with the Durrodan family, Cardorn is taken prisoner but the Durrodans grant them a small reward and the promise of future work. If they side with Cardorn, fight off the mercenaries, and escort Cardorn home, he introduces the characters to Gothad Miskal (neutral evil, male, [[Halflings|halfling]] [bandit captain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit-captain)), a [[The Myriad|Myriad]] taskmaster from [[Yrrosa]] who is interested in offering better pay for less legal work.
