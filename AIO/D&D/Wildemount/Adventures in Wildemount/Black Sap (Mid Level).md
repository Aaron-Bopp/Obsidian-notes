#### Black Sap (Mid Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Olc Skerry]]
**Level**:: Mid Level

 Visitors to [[Olc Skerry]] can't help but notice an old stone windmill perched atop a rocky hill just south of town, its four spindly vanes stripped to their wooden bones. Behind the crumbling, desolate structure grows a large death's head willow, from which characters can extract 20 doses of black sap (see the "[Blightshore Contraband](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-[[blightshore]]#BlightshoreContraband "[[Blightshore]] Contraband")" sidebar earlier in this chapter). The black sap is worth a small fortune in the black markets of [[Rotthold]]. However, the windmill is home to an oni that doesn't take kindly to the sap's theft.
