#### [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]] Spy (Low Level)
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Adventure
**Location**:: [[Felderwin Tillage]]
**Level**:: Low Level

 The characters are hired by a farming family in the Tillage to get to the bottom of recent arsons that burned crops in [[Felderwin Tillage]]. The culprit behind the fires is difficult to find because they are a [doppelganger](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/doppelganger) working for the [[Kryn Dynasty|Kryn]], masquerading as multiple absent members of the community. Moreover, once the characters ask too many questions, the doppelganger begins hunting them as well.
