#### The Signet Wall
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/MarrowValley/Zadash
**Location**:: [[Zadash]]

 The Signet Wall encloses the eastern end of the city and houses [[Zadash]]'s reserve force of [[Righteous Brand]] soldiers. The Signet Ramparts are a collection of four simple stone and wood buildings that act as barracks and living quarters for all local [[Crownsguard]]. The clangs of training blades and blacksmiths' hammers fill the air for half the day, while drinking songs and bawdy rhymes fill the other half. Beyond those grounds lies the dark stone entrance to the impressive, eight-floor, subterranean prison known as the Umber Dungeon, where criminals from the streets of [[Zadash]] are held and punished, with the most dangerous imprisoned in the deepest cells. The Shrine of the Dawn, a temple of pale stone and stained glass dedicated to [[Pelor]] the [[Pelor|Dawn Father]], where both civilians and soldiers can worship, marks the center of the district. The eastern wall ends in the Marrow Keeps of the [[Righteous Brand]], a massive stronghold surrounded by a half-dozen smaller fortifications that make up the southern bastion of [[Bertrand Dwendal|the Crown]]'s military power.
