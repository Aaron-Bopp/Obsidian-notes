#### Gallimaufry
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Locale/Wynandir/Xhorhas/Rosohna
**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

 Deeper into the heart of [[Rosohna]] is the massive region called the Gallimaufry. The rowdiest and most vibrant ward of the city, the Gallimaufry marks the intersection of culture and commerce where citizens come to share ideas, peddle wares and services, find employment, or celebrate personal victories large and small in the company of other folk from the wastes. The area is lit with ever-burning lanterns of green light strung across street corners and roadways, and the percussive music of the [[Wastefolk]] mingles with the haunting melodies of [[Dark Elves|drow]] musicians to produce an ever-shifting atmosphere that many find at once both welcoming and claustrophobic.
