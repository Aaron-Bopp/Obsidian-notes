**Location**:: [[Rosohna]]

The many levels of the Dungeon of Penance delve under the city. This terrifying oubliette bears the marks of the [[Kryn Dynasty]]'s renovations on its upper levels, but become less explored and less changed from the days of [[Ghor Dranas]] the deeper one delves.
 
As the largest prison within the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]], a microcosm of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] itself can be found in the complex bureaucracy of jailors, supervisors, and elite [[Aurora Watch]] soldiers who guard the frigid halls of the dungeon.
