### Seasons

**Location**:: [[Daily Life in Wildemount]]

[[Wildemount]] is a chilly continent — with the exception of the sunny, tropical [[Menagerie Coast]] — and each of the regions experiences the passing of the seasons differently.

[[Western Wynandir]] suffers from dismal, rainy springs and bitter winters. The [[Menagerie Coast]] enjoys a long, balmy summer, but must endure a vicious, typhoon-rich winter. The [[Biting North]] is always blanketed by snow, but temperatures drop to deadly lows in the winter, then let up for a rainy, relatively mild summer. Finally, [[Eastern Wynandir]] enjoys level, temperate weather all year long across its lowland regions, save for the cutting winds that rip across the plains in spring and autumn.
