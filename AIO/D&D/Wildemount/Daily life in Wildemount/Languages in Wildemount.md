All the typical languages found in the [Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook") and the [Monster Manual](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm "Monster Manual") are fair game in [[Wildemount]]. While Common is used across the continent and typically associated with [[Humans|human]] empires, it is not the language that most [[humans]] spoke in [[Wildemount]] before the rise of [[Dwendalian Empire]] three centuries ago.

This setting has three languages unique to the [[Humans|human]] cultures of [[Wildemount]]: Zemnian, Marquesian, and Naush. A [[Humans|human]] character can learn one of these languages instead of a skill or tool proficiency granted by their background, class, or variant racial traits. Each of these languages is described below:

**Zemnian.** This ancient language was spoken by the people of Zemniaz in the [[Age of Arcanum]]. That ancient culture has long since crumbled, but its language and its people live on in the [[Dwendalian Empire]]. Many ancient scrolls were written in Zemnian, but it is a language now largely spoken by farmers, as Common is the default language of the [[Dwendalian Empire|empire]].

**Marquesian.** The [[Menagerie Coast]] was settled by colonists from the arid land of [[Marquet]], and their language now holds an unusual position in the [[Clovis Concord]]. It is the language of high society, as many Clovis elite are descended from Marquesians, but it is also the language of piracy, since countless lower-class Marquesians defected from the [[Clovis Concord|Concord]] and formed [[The Revelry]] pirates.

**Naush.** Originally spoken by [[Ki’Nau]] islanders native to the [[Menagerie Coast]], Naush is a thriving language within the multicultural cities of the [[Clovis Concord]]. Even sailors who only speak Common incorporate dozens of Naush words into their nautical jargon.
