### The Harbingers of the Core
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

These aberrant cultists worship the terrors born from the dreams of the [[Elder Evils]]: impossibly ancient, malevolent entities who exist within the [[Far Realm]] and the spaces beyond the known planes. Touched by madness, their bodies often subtly mutated by their contact with the horrors to whom they pray, the Harbingers of the Core gather in the broken lands of [[Blightshore]] to summon and unleash the terrible children of their masters.
