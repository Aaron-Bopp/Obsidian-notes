### Lilyana Cayd
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

**Allignment**:: Chaotic good
**Gender**:: female
**Race**:: werewolf ([[Half Elves|half-elf]])

A sarcastic spitfire who joined the orders to help gain control over her lycanthropy, Lilyana has become a masterful [[blood hunter]] in an impressively short period of time. She leads many hunts with her keen, lycanthropic senses, and is known for being more personable than most who undergo the Hunterâ€™s [[Bane]]. Lilyana is spoken of with equal parts irritation and awe within the circles of the orders.
