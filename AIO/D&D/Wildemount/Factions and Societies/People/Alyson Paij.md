### Captain Alyson Paij
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

**Allignment**:: Chaotic good
**Gender**:: female
**Race**:: [[Humans|human]]

Known to many as the “Screaming Knuckle,” Alyson is the loud and joyful captain of the ship The Ill Hand who enjoys a good brawl as much as she appreciates a stiff drink. Paij took to piracy because of her hatred for the [[Clovis Concord]], but she is driven by an uncompromising sense of moral duty to the downtrodden. She never raids civilian vessels, and she does her best to rein in [[The Revelry]]’s cruelest captains and focus their efforts on those who deserve to have their goods stolen.
