### Claret Director Jette Brashan
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

_Neutral, male half-orc_

An elderly priest of [[the Raven Queen]] who’s as revered as he is feared, Jette has a powerful will and a tactician’s mind. Jette never makes direct eye contact, and it seems that his attention is scattered among a dozen points at any given time, yet his ability to read patterns and calculate the hidden nature of evil leaves his compatriots in awe. Absolutely dedicated to the eradication of fiendish influence on the mortal plane, Jette has sacrificed much in his pursuit — all who serve him suspect that, one day, he will gladly make the ultimate sacrifice.
