_Neutral, female half-orc_

A scatterbrained scholar whose subtle brilliance has increased the effectiveness of the [[Kryn Dynasty|dynasty]] warmachines, Professor Waccoh usually oversees a number of academic programs and private research projects at the Marble Tomes Conservatory within the [[Firmaments]] of [[Rosohna]]. Recently obsessed with the desolate, cursed lands of [[Blightshore]] and the mysteries that lie hidden within, Tuss is actively seeking allies and mercenaries to send into the dangerous lands to recover information, relics, and specimens for further study.
