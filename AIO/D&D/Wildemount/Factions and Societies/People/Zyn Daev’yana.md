Zyn was born in squalor in the [[Coronas]] of [[Rosohna]]. [[Lolth]] found him at his nadir and showed him how to refine himself into a true liar. He’s since risen to become one of the more even-tempered members of [[Den]] Daev’yana, climbing the ranks as a respected strategist and writer. Using his position to sew discord and doubt amongst the Dens, he privately communes with the Spider Queen as one of her most trusted operatives.
