### Vasan Atrith, Marquis of [[Gwardan]]
**Tag**:: #Exandria/Person
**Location**:: [[Factions and Societies]]

**Allignment**:: Lawful good
**Gender**:: female
**Race**:: [[Elves|elf]]

Unflappable and driven to protect the people of her city, Vasan is a bit of an outsider among the other marquises of the Clovis Conchord for her standoffish nature and the way she unapologetically prioritizes the wellbeing of her city over that of the whole coast. Though Vasan presents herself as aloof and uninformed, much of her political persona is intended to sow underestimation of how informed and clever she may be.
