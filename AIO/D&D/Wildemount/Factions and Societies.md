> Queens, kings, emperors, nobles … beneath the rhetoric, it’s all the same. They say they fight to protect your families. They say they fight to enforce your beliefs, your honor. Fight for a better tomorrow. Fight for virtue, for prosperity. Bottom line, it’s all about fighting, and it’s you that dies fighting for their cause.
> — Unknown soldier, *Collected Tales of [[the Marrow War]]*

From the ashes of a land devastated by [[the Calamity]] grew the civilizations of a new age. The survivors claimed land across the continent, forged alliances, and made enemies as they fought for power and influence. [[Wildemount]] is shaped by the ideals and interests of its factions, from powerful governments to covert societies. This war-torn continent is a fertile landscape for adventurers on a quest for greatness.
