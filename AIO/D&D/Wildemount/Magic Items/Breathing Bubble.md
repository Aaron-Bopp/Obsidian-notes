**Item**:: Wondrous item
**Rarity**:: common

This translucent, bubble-like sphere has a slightly tacky outer surface, and you gain the itemâ€™s benefits only while wearing it over your head like a helmet.

The bubble contains 1 hour of breathable air. The bubble regains all its expended air daily at dawn.
