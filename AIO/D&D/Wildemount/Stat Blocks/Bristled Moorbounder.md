_**Bristled [[Moorbounders]].**_ A weird and deadly offshoot of the [[moorbounder]] has rows of long, bladelike bristles covering its sleek body. The creature weaponizes these blades, using them to slash nearby creatures to ribbons. However, these blades make the bristled [[moorbounder]] less suitable as a mount.
