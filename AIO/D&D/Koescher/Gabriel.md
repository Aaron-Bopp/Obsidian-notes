# Moves
Angel Wings: You  can  go  instantly  to  anywhere  you’ve  visited  before,  or  to  a  person  you  know  well.  When you  carry  one  or  two  people  with  you,  roll  +Weird. On a 10+ you all go where you wanted. On a  7-9,  you  don’t  quite  manage  it.  Either  you  are  all  separated, or you all appear in the wrong place.
What  I  Need,  When  I  Need  It:  You  may  store  any  small object you own, putting it into a magical space nobody  can  get  to.  You  may  retrieve  anything  you  stored at any time; it appears in your hand
Soothe: Whenyou  talk  to  someone  for  a  few  seconds in a quiet voice, you can calm them down, blocking  any  panic,  anger,  or  other  negative  emo-tions  they  have.  This  works  even  if  the  thing  that  freaked  them  out  is  still  present,  as  long  as  your  voice can be heard.
Fervor:   When   you   manipulate   someone,   roll   +Tough instead of +Charm.

Bright Staff: remove the glitches from use magic twice a day. Use magic is advanced
Players found cannister of stigion acid (unholy water) in lukas shed. This is the only thing that can break down and fully destroy the weapon. I have the sould a face is twoface with the the blade being the nose. Reality is breaking around maxine. Hundreds of eyes following her. Rapier can create breaks and doorways to teleport. The weapons are pocket dimensions that hold their owners. Elise has used to this to be able to teleport. The ritual is the only way to keep maxine alive. Remaining weapons are bow and gauntlet. Clancy is alive and somewhere in the 
wilderness either with the weapon 

shards are actual peices of the rapier. Dolls were remotely triggered. make a doorway into the rapier 

super soaker is 3 harm far holy liquid weapon. Has unlimited holy water and stigion acid (unholy water). 
bow magic bowstring made of light. arrows have fine control and can tether

one person on each weapon and then one person will have to use magic. If that fails the souls will automatically enter the gbodies of the people holding them.
