## Moves
**Jinx**:  You  can  encourage  coincidences  to  occur,  the  way you want. When you jinx a target, roll +Weird. On a 10+ hold 2 and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, the Keeper holds 2 over you to be used in the same way. Spend your hold to:
- Interfere with a hunter, giving them -1 forward.
- Help a hunter, giving them +1 forward, by interfering with their enemy.
- Interfere   with   what   a   monster,   minion,   or   bystander is trying to do.
- Inflict 1-harm on the target due to an accident.
- The target finds something you left for them.
- The  target  loses  something  that  you  will  soon  find.

**Telepathy**: You can read  people’s  thoughts  and  put  words  in  their  mind.  This  can  allow  you  to  investigate  a  mystery  or  read  a  bad  situation  without  needing  to  actually  talk.  You  can  also  manipulate someone  without  speaking.  You  still  roll  moves  as  normal, except people will not expect the weirdness of your mental communication

**Haven**
Haven: Magical Laboratory: You  have  a  mystical  lab  with  all  kinds  of  weird  ingredients  and  tools  useful  for  casting  spells  (like  the  use  magic  move,  big  magic,  and any other magical moves).
Infirmary: You can heal people, and have the space for one or two to recuperate. The Keeper will tell you how long any patient’s recovery is likely to take, and if you need extra supplies or help
Protective Spells:  Your  haven  is  safe  from  monsters—they  cannot  enter.  Monsters  might  be  able  to do something special to evade the wards, but not easily.

**Hunches**: When  something  bad  is  happening  (or  just  about  to  happen)  somewhere  that  you  aren’t,  roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you knew where you needed to  go,  just  in  time  to  get  there.  On  a  7-9,  you  get  there  late—in  time  to  intervene,  but  not  prevent  it  altogether. On a miss, you get there just in time to be in trouble yourself.

**Third Eye**: When you read a bad situation, you can open  up  your  third  eye  for  a  moment  to  take  in  extra  information.  Take  +1  hold  on  any  result  of  7  or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you’re exposed to super-natural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!
