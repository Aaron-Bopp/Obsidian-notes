##### [[the politicization of the christian church]] `=length([[the politicization of the christian church]].file.inlinks) + length([[the politicization of the christian church]].file.outlinks)`

The modern church is focused on building a [[counter-culture]] movement that is loyal to a fault. [[Homophobia]] takes sin from the realm of actions to lifestyle, [[creationism]] erodes peoples [[faith]] in science, [[abortion]] forces people to vote for one political party without even caring about the rest of its platform. I just see Christians being taken advantage of time and time again because they believe so deeply.

[[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the christian church]]
