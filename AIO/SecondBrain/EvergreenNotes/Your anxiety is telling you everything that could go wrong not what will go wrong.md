If you can acknowledge that what your anxiety is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the judgment on whether you should go through with the thing or not. 

Being able to do this requires a very healthy amount of [[mindfullness]], and a large amount of self-awareness. Once you've achieved these things you're anxiety can start to be an aspect of your [[mindfullness]] rather than an inhibitor. ([[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]])

Anxiety can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but our [[subconscious]]/[[ego]] do not know that.

The reason this happens is rooted in [[Neuroscience]]. Anxiety is at it's core a warning system, which means that it is a big part of [[human survival]]/[[human advancement]]. As we satisfy more and more of the [[Hierachy of Needs]] our need for such an advanced warning system grows less and less. In modern society, our anxiety can seem like a irrational response, but it is just our brain doing what is has evolved to do. #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is modern over compensation or just the next natural step in human evolution.

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is anxiety purely involuntary or can it come out of obsessiveness/[[OCD]]?

[[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] which is only made worse by the fact [[your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
