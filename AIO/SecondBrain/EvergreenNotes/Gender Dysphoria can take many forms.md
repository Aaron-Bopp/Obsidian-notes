##### [[Gender Dysphoria can take many forms]] `=length(this.file.inlinks) + length(this.file.outlinks)`

Gender Dysphoria does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong gender with all the wrong body parts. [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]. People will experience gender differently and any inconsistency with other trans people does not invalidate their existence.
