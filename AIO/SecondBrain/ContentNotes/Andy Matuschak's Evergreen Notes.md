Author:: [[Andy Matuschak]]
- [[evergreen notes]]s evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time/projects
	- [[evergreen notes]]s support knowledge, transient notes don't
- [[evergreen notes]]s should be:
	- atomic
	- concept oriented
	- densely linked
	- organically structural
- My reading inbox is  the to(do) structure and my writing inbox is the ever(green) structure [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]
