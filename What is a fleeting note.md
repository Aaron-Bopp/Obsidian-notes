A fleeting note is one that is taken at spur of the moment speed. You may not have time to do that work that is required for a [[permanent note]], but you should have enough time to categorize your note as a fleeting note so that you can easily find it later on and either discard it or organize it into a [[permanent note]]
The way that I accomplish this in my system is using the [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] and [[daily logs]]
