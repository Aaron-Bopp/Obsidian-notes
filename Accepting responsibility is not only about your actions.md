# Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions

Accepting responsibility often requires accepting responsibility for things out of your control. Whether it be your own trauma, the needs of others pushed upon you, or the sins of your ancestors that you still benefit from. Accepting responsibility for these kind of things is not taught at a young age in America because that goes against [[individualism]].
