A permanent note is a singular concept that you have conceptualized and written down. This term is used across [[personal knowledge management]] but its use within specific systems varies. In general, a permanent note is something that you do not want to forget, but it can be combined with other notes, expanded upon, and changed over time. Permanent notes are are a broader category that would include [[evergreen note]], and [[zettle]]

The only constraint on the way permanent notes are titled is uniqueness. If you are creating a new note and run into a naming conflict it can mean one of a few things.
1. The old note's title is too broad and should be changed
2. the new note's title is too broad and should be changed
3. Both note's titles are too broad and they should be related by a [[topic note]]. 
4. Both note's title are accurate and they should be combined/edited together
