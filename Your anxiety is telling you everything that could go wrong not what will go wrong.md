# Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong not what will go wrong

If you can acknowledge that what your anxiety is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the judgment on whether you should go through with the thing or not. 

Being able to do this requires a very healthy amount of mindfulness, and a large amount of self-awareness. Once you've achieved these things you're anxiety can start to be an aspect of your mindfulness rather than an inhibitor. ([[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]])

Anxiety can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but our brain and our anxiety do not know that.

[[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] which is only made worse by the fact [[your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
