I think from an early age I had many sources of negative feedback for things that made me feel like who I was supposed to be was unnatural. Whether it was getting my hair cut short, or feeling a rush of testosterone when playing sports or being competitive, things that I was supposed to like weren't reinforced by my assigned gender. Things that did make me feel good were denounced. 

The only logical thought process I could have at that age was that the positive emotions that received negative condemnation were unnatural and so I made a sweeping generalization that all positive emotions were unnatural. This is why I poured my interests into things that were intellectual pursuits. 

While I do think this sweeping generalization was there. Obviously I as a child didn't understand it. Sometimes I would pursue things because I thought they really did make me happy, while other times they actually did make me happy but in a way that I didn't think was wrong. As I have questioned my existence more and more I have discovered more and more internalized beliefs of mine that are irrational and unnatural. These discoveries giver me hope, but the solution scares me
