## INTRODUCTION Contents

Of the many forms of political action in twenty-first-
century America, it’s hard to think of any less popular than rioting and
looting. Voting and electioneering are widely respected as the baseline of
political action; petitioning and lobbying elected representatives are not
far behind. Labor action, despite four decades of propaganda and federal
action against it, still has strong support in many quarters. Community
organizing is at least theoretically the founding principle for thousands
of nonprofits across the country. Liberals and conservatives alike grudg-
ingly support demonstrations, at least when they’re nonviolent and their
people are doing it.
More extreme political actions also have widespread support. Both
liberals and conservatives believe in war, considering it a necessary evil
or a fundamental good. Liberals may oppose the death penalty, but they,
like conservatives, believe in the efficacy of murder: they had little to say
about Obama’s extrajudicial drone executions, his death lists and Terror
Tuesdays, and Democrats mostly critiqued Trump’s 2020 assassination of
Qasem Soleimani on procedural grounds: “He didn’t consult Congress!”
Torture is celebrated a thousand times a day on television in police proce-
durals and action flicks, and most people accept imprisonment—years of

unrelenting psychic torture—as a necessary fact of social life. Economic
coercion on the international stage, through sanctions, trade agreements,
and development loans, is a matter of course. At home, the threat of un-
employment, homelessness, starvation, and destitution, along with debt,
taxes, fines, and fees of all kinds, are so naturalized as to rarely even be
recognized as a form of political domination at all.
But rioting and looting have few defenders. Conservatives, of course,
oppose it utterly, rooting for the police to put down protesters, with the
Far Right claiming riots are just professional troublemaking fomented by
George Soros, Jews, and the “global elite.” Liberals oppose rioting, too:
because their love for law and order is much greater than their belief in
freedom, they claim that rioters are “hurting their own cause” or are led
by police provocateurs—agreeing with the fascists that rioters are paid
troublemakers, just disagreeing about who signs the checks.
In the face of rioting and looting, even sympathetic self-identifying
radicals sometimes balk. They claim that these more extreme actions
are mainly the work of outside agitators, “opportunists,” or out-of-step
middle- class radicals. They claim that those doing the looting are “not
part of the movement,” that they are “apolitical” and ignorant, that their
actions reflect “false consciousness,” or even that they are acting as con-
sumers and therefore furthering capitalism.
From within the movement, people tend to claim that what hap-
pened wasn’t rioting but an uprising or a rebellion. No one wants to be
associated with the idea of riot, and this is doubly true for looting. Even
while a riot is going on, people in the streets often work to block looting.
Many of them do so out of care for the struggle, worried about unfair
media representation and hoping to advance the politically and ethically
advantageous position. I understand that instinct, but it was to critique
and push against that thinking, crucially in love and solidarity with those
who pursue it and with looters the world over, that I began this project.
Other people, however—including local politicians, middle-class
“leaders,” political groups, and reactionary organizations—block loot-
ing in order to gain power for themselves. These peacekeepers and de-
escalators cooperate with the police to derail and destroy uprisings to
show the white power structure that they are responsible parties, that,



Introduction 3
because they can control and contain the unruly masses, they are the
“natural leaders,” the people who should be negotiated with. This book
is spit in their eyes.
Looting is so unpopular not because it is an error or bad for the move-
ment but because it is often a movement’s most radical tactic. Looting
attacks some of the core beliefs and structures of cisheteropatriarchal ra-
cial capitalist society, and so frightens and disturbs nearly everyone, even
some of its participants. After all, we have all been raised and trained
to hold, follow, and reproduce those beliefs every day. Looting rejects
the legitimacy of ownership rights and property, the moral injunction to
work for a living, and the “justice” of law and order. Looting reveals all
these for what they are: not natural facts, but social constructs benefiting
a few at the expense of the many, upheld by ideology, economy, and state
violence.
That looting is one of the most racially loaded, morally abhorred, and
depoliticized concepts in modern society should come as no surprise.
From its very first usages, the word has served to re-enforce the white
supremacist juncture of property and race.
The word loot is taken up from the Hindi word lút—similar to “plun-
der” or “booty”—which first appears in Anglophone contexts in 1788 in a
handbook on “Indian Vocabulary” for English colonial officers.^1 In loot’s
first recorded appearance in the English language, it describes how an
officer managed to gain consent and gather recruits for subduing Indian
resistance: “He always found the talismanic gathering-word Loot (plun-
der) a sufficient bond of union in any part of India.” The racialized idea
of an “Indian” identity did not yet exist outside the minds of the coloniz-
ers, but a natural racial tendency, one overcoming tribal, religious, and
cultural differences, could be “revealed” by the offer of plunder. In other
words, a deviant relationship to property is the “sufficient” attribute that
unifies and defines an otherwise disparate group under the sign of race.
The earliest appearances of the gerund looting, meanwhile, refer to “hir-
sute Sikhs” and “Chinese blackguards.”^2 Looting is a word taken from a
colonized people and used to denigrate and racialize riotous subalterns
resisting English empire. It would from the very beginning refer to a non-
white and lawless relationship to property.


4 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

The looting that I am defending in this book is not that act that can
be described by the synonym plunder. The looting of captured territory
by armies, for example, or of colonial wealth by empire and its agents,
can be equally well described by words like robbery, pillage, booty, and
spoils. But the looting described, defended, and historicized here—that
of a crowd of people publicly, openly, and directly taking things in the
midst of riot and social unrest—has no easy synonym. I personally like
the phrases “proletarian shopping” and “shopping for free” quite a lot
and use the Marxist “expropriation,” too. But all those phrases drain the
idea of looting of its racializing character. Although it is understandable
why people would want, in defending their movements, to find a less
charged word, it is precisely the fact that looting exists at the nexus of race
and class that gives it its tactical power.
Looting is a method of direct redistribution of wealth, from the store
owners and capitalists to the poor. Looting, as scholar Delio Vasquez
writes in “The Poor Person’s Defense of Riots,” “directly results (unless
you get arrested) in your acquiring the things that you are seeking.”^3 It
is a practical, immediate form of improving life. Looting represents a
material way that riots and protests help the community: by providing a
way for people to solve some of the immediate problems of poverty and
by creating a space for people to freely reproduce their lives rather than
doing so through wage labor. Looting is an act of communal cohesion.
But looting is also an act of excess, of property destruction. When
something is looted, that thing’s nature as a commodity is destroyed by its
being taken for free, out of the cycle of exchange and profit. Everything
in the store goes from being a commodity to becoming a gift. Less ab-
stractly, looting is usually followed up by burning down the shop. Looters
also frequently throw items out onto the streets for anyone to take or pile
goods chaotically in the middle of the store or pass bottles of liquor, bags
of food, or goods between strangers and around the crowd. Looting in-
volves not only taking wealth directly but also immediately sharing that
wealth, which points to the collapse of the system by which the looted
things produce value.
Looting is a communal practice: it cannot be done alone. Anthro-
pologist Neal Keating argues that looting creates a similar relation to


```
Introduction 5
```
property as the potlatch, a communal practice of Indigenous nations in
the Pacific Northwest. In the potlatch, held on a variety of special oc-
casions—births, deaths, weddings, festivals—wealthy people compete to
see who can give away the most possessions to the gathered celebrants
and they vie with each other to destroy the most accumulated wealth in
a massive bonfire. The potlatch works to level wealth in the community
by consuming surplus, which might otherwise enable some to develop
more permanent forms of power through excess accumulation. Rioting
and looting similarly redistribute and reduce the wealth and the surplus,
leveling material power differentials.^4 The potlatch was outlawed by the
Canadian government as a part of its (ongoing) genocide of the First Na-
tions: the potlatch was considered one of the most important obstacles
to their becoming “civilized” and Christian. Like looting, this nonwhite,
noncommodified communal approach to property was seen as a danger-
ous threat to capitalism and “civilization.”
Though no single instance of looting is on its own sufficient to trans-
form society, obviously, looting—at least when carried out by Black, poor,
or Indigenous people—will always be strenuously and vigorously dis-
avowed by the powers that be because it points to and immediately enacts
a different relationship to property, a different history. There have been few
instances of looting in the United States in the last quarter century; when
it has appeared, it has been during brief and often one-off uprisings. De-
spite this fact, when the flames went up over a looted Quik Trip in Fergu-
son, Missouri, in August 2014, as antipolice rioting broke out after Michael
Brown was killed, the media produced lines of argument and criticism that
you might have just as easily heard in the sixties. Politicians and media out-
lets have a number of tried-and-true disavowals and defamations of looters
at the ready. Before moving on to the historical narrative of looting in the
United States, it’s worth dealing with these common objections here.

“Riots Are Being Stirred Up by Outside Agitators”

The myth of “outside agitators” is used by conservatives and nonviolence
champions alike to discredit militancy wherever it appears. This one
is a white supremacist classic, going all the way back to slavery. Under


6 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

slavery, plantation owners claimed that unrest, rebellions, and fugitives
resulted from the influence of “uppity negroes” and pernicious Yankees
who had come south to delude the otherwise content enslaved with ideas
of freedom and equality. The completely racist assumptions at the base of
this argument—happy dumb slaves duped into believing they are human
beings by scheming Northerners—still forms the logic behind the “out-
side agitator,” a phrase that emerged in force during the civil rights move-
ment. Martin Luther King was the prototypical outside agitator, traveling
the country fighting segregation, although white civil rights activists were
also often tarred with this brush. These days “white anarchists,” George
Soros and the employees of his organization, “antifa,” or “agent provoca-
teurs” are likely to be the preferred outside agitating boogeymen.
This logic strips those who protest of their power, claiming that their
experiences, lives, and desires are not actually sufficient to inspire their
acts of resistance—implying that they don’t know what they’re doing. It
also begins from the presumption that the world is fine as it is, and so
only nihilistic or paid troublemakers could challenge it. But it is a racist
idea on its face. What actually is wrong with an outside agitator? The
concept is structured around the implicit racial logic of borders and cit-
izenship through which an individual’s status inside/outside is the main
consideration that determines political legitimacy. Outside of what?
Why shouldn’t we at least consider ideas or agitation from “outside”
our most immediate environs? Isn’t that what we call solidarity?

“Rioters Are Destroying Their Own Neighborhoods”

The “why do you destroy your own neighborhoods?” trope emerged in
force during the dozens of uprisings in cities across the United States
during the sixties. Here we see a willful confusion of geography and
power. Though the buildings destroyed may be located in a predom-
inantly Black or proletarian neighborhood, the losses go to the white,
bourgeois building and business owners, rarely the people who live near
them. Civil rights leader Stokely Carmichael (later Kwame Ture) had to
challenge these logics to defend the riots: “In these cities we do not con-
trol our resources. We do not control the land, the houses or the stores.


```
Introduction 7
```
These are owned by whites who live outside ‘the community.’ . . . White
power makes the laws and enforces those laws with guns and nightsticks
in the hands of white racist policemen and black mercenaries.”^5
Assata Shakur, freedom fighter in the Black liberation movement
and the federal government’s most wanted fugitive, describes having
the same argument with white coworkers, who wanted Shakur to admit
“what a shame it was” that rioters were destroying their neighborhoods
and to disavow them. But Shakur instead put forward the positive case
for the destruction: “They don’t own those houses. They don’t own those
stores. I’m glad they burned down those stores because those stores were
robbing them in the first place!”^6
With the post-sixties emergence of a Black business class and, later,
a Black president, and with the legal dismantling of Jim Crow, the logic
that rioters are destroying their own neighborhoods has only grown stron-
ger. Because a higher (though still small) percentage of owners, busi-
nesspeople, and politicians are likely to be Black, it becomes even easier
to imagine looting and rioting as somehow striking internally within the
Black community. As Tyler Reinhard wrote in the wake of the Ferguson
uprising: “I’m not sure how people who make this argument imagine
‘owning’ a neighborhood works, but I’ll try to break it down: we don’t own
neighborhoods. Black businesses exist, it’s true. But the emancipation of
impoverished communities is not measured in corner-store revenue. It’s
not measured in minimum-wage jobs.”^7
As a Ferguson rioter put it in a viral Instagram video, “People wanna
say we destroying our own neighborhoods. We don’t own nothing out
here!” This could be said of most majority Black neighborhoods in Amer-
ica, which have much higher concentrations of chain stores and fast food
restaurants than non-Black neighborhoods. How could the average Fer-
guson resident really say it’s “our QuikTrip”? Indeed, although you might
hang out in it, how can a chain convenience store or corporate restaurant
earnestly be part of anyone’s neighborhood? The same white liberals who
inveigh against corporations for destroying local communities are aghast
when rioters take their critique to its actual material conclusion.
Only a cop, in this case Baltimore police commissioner Anthony
Batts, prosecuting an arsonist from the 2015 Freddie Gray uprisings,

could say without irony “Raymon Carter burned a CVS—our CVS—
to the ground.” Nowhere is the absurd hollowness of modern American
populism more clear than in a police commissioner’s heartfelt pause,
then plea: not just any CVS; “our CVS.”

“Looters Are Opportunists and Criminals, Not Protesters:
They Have Nothing to Do with the Struggle”

When protesters proclaim that “not all protesters were looters, in fact,
most of the looters weren’t part of the protest!” or words to that effect, they
are trying to fight a horrifically racist history of Black people depicted in
American culture as robbers and thieves: it is a completely righteous and
understandable position.
However, in trying to correct this media image—in making a strong
division between Good Protesters and Bad Rioters, or between ethical
nonviolence practitioners and supposedly violent looters—the narrative
of the criminalization of Black youth is reproduced. This time it makes
criminal and moral divisions between certain kinds of Black youth—
those who loot (bad) versus those who protest (good). The effect of this
discourse is hardening a permanent category of criminality on Black sub-
jects who produce a supposed crime within the context of an “accept-
able” protest (though those protesters would be just as quickly slandered
as criminals in less confrontational protest scenarios). It reproduces racist
and white supremacist ideologies, deeming some unworthy of our soli-
darity and protection, marking them, subtly, as legitimate targets of po-
lice violence.^8
If looters are “not part of the protest,” then why do they appear again
and again in liberatory uprisings? In fact, a number of sociological stud-
ies from the seventies showed that, against the commonsense narrative,
those who participate in rioting and looting tend to be the most politi-
cally informed and socially engaged in the neighborhood, while the most
apathetic, disconnected, and alienated people riot at the lowest rates.
This suggests that looters and rioters understand the stakes and meaning
of the struggle, have been active within it, and see looting as a sensible
escalation of possibilities.

“Rioters Hurt the Media Coverage, They Make Us/Our Concerns Look Bad”

Rioters are often accused of being the cause of negative media coverage.
But this claim is always made after the cameras have arrived, without
recognition of how or why those cameras got there. If it were not for
rioters, the media would probably pay no attention at all. If protesters
hadn’t looted and burnt down that QuikTrip on the second day of pro-
tests, would Ferguson have become a point of worldwide attention? It’s
impossible to know, but all the nonviolent protests against police killings
across the country that go unreported seem to indicate the answer is no. It
was the looting of a Duane Reade, and not the vigil that preceded it, that
brought widespread attention to the murder of Kimani Gray in New York
City in 2013. The media’s own warped procedure instructs that riots and
looting are more effective at attracting attention to a cause.
But the point of a protest isn’t media attention, anyway. As a 1967
editorial on press coverage of urban riots in the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee’s The Movement magazine put it: “The white-
run daily press in America is not an objective, critical viewer of events.
Newspapers are industries. They are private property, not public utilities.
When black people revolt against their conditions, they are also revolting
against the mass media; the press.”
The essay reproduced and analyzed guidelines on covering future
instances of unrest that were given out to CBS reporters in the wake of
Watts. The editors highlight one of those guidelines, which says: “At the
outset of the disorder, broadcast newsmen should be dispatched to law
enforcement command posts, rather than directly to the scene, where
their presence may heighten the disturbance or interfere with efforts to
establish control. An authoritatively staffed command post will undoubt-
edly be in communication with the scenes of disorder and be capable of
providing newsmen with any desired information.”^9
During the LA riots of 1992, national news broadcast nonstop footage
of the violent beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by four Black
teens that was captured by news helicopters. The news did not provide
the context—that the National Guard had just driven through that inter-
section, firing live rounds at rioters, meaning Denny was in the wrong


10 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

place at the wrong time—or the aftermath, in which other Black rioters
ran out, tended to his wounds, and got him to a hospital, saving his life,
though both were also captured on camera. Instead, the violent beating
was shown on loop, out of context, across the country.
During the UK riots in summer 2011, which saw people rise up in
response to the police murder of Mark Duggan, the BBC, which had
mostly relied on helicopter and police footage, did a live interview with a
man from Croydon, one of the London neighborhoods where rioting was
intense. That man, Darcus Howe, was a respected broadcaster and writer
originally from Trinidad. The presenter asked him leading questions
about how terrible the riots were, but Howe clearly and angrily laid out
the stakes of the riot. “What I was certain about, listening to my son and
my grandson, is that something very serious was going to happen in this
country. Our leaders had no idea. . . . But if you listened to young Blacks,
and young whites in this country . . . you would know that what is hap-
pening to them is wrong.” The presenter then interrupted him, insulted
him, and accused him of being a rioter himself. The BBC was forced to
issue an apology, but it also scrubbed the footage from its websites and
future broadcasts, preferring not to allow this accidental moment of rad-
ical clarity to continue.
No matter how peaceful and “well-behaved” a protest is, the domi-
nant media will always push the police talking points and the white su-
premacist agenda. Although it can sometimes be leveraged strategically,
the mass media is the enemy of liberation, and when we shape our ac-
tions to conform to its opinions or perspectives, we will always lose. If we
riot, they will slander us. If we behave politely, peacefully, legally, they
will simply return to ignoring us.

“Rioting, Looting, and Property Destruction Justify Police Repression”

People are told not to escalate, that nonviolence will prevent police from
being excessively violent toward activists. But this reflects a shoddy analy-
sis of state violence in the face of the very thing these uprisings are about:
Black people being killed for walking in the middle of the street, selling


```
Introduction 11
```
CDs or cigarettes, driving with a broken taillight, wearing a hoodie, etc.,
etc., etc. How is it that we can go to the streets to protest that violence still
believing that our behavior dictates police response rather than recogniz-
ing that the police will brutalize whoever they want, whenever they want
to, unless we can stop them?

“Looters Are Just Being ‘Consumers,’ They Are Acting on False Consciousness”

Many people—self-styled “revolutionaries”—criticize rioters for looting
flat-screen TVs or expensive sneakers. These people often claim they
would support looters stealing medicine or food, life necessities, but be-
cause they are stealing expensive commodities it reveals that rioters are
just “consumerists,” “materialistic.” As Evan Calder Williams wrote in his
essay “An Open Letter to Those Who Condemn Looting,” this analysis
was particularly prevalent around the 2011 UK riots. Even during the ri-
ots, the entire white UK Left, from the left-liberal media establishment to
the “revolutionary” political parties, basically told rioters to drop dead. As
Williams asks, are these revolutionaries to have us believe that “the poor
are not supposed to understand the fundamentals of exchange-value?
That they should have been loading shopping carts with flour and beans,
rather than with computers which could, in theory, be sold for a much
larger quantity of flour and beans?”^10
The failure isn’t merely an economic one: when people make this
argument, they reveal a fundamental contempt for the poor. They share
a moral logic with conservative antiwelfare talking heads and pull-up-
your-pants respectability politicians who claim that poor people are poor
because they spend their money on smartphones or fancy clothes. These
so-called revolutionaries, who support the looting of bread, but not of li-
quor, reveal that they are only willing to support poor people in struggles
for bare survival: in other words, in struggles that keep them poor. They
withdraw their solidarity when the proletariat act on desires to have their
lives be more pleasurable and more worth living.^11
These reactionaries don’t want the poor to have nice things any more
than the police who execute looters do. They see the masses as fetish


12 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

objects in their feverish revolutionary abstractions, who should only rise
up in some pure proletarian struggle, perhaps led by them at the van-
guard of a glorious Party.
All of these different slanders contain a connecting thread: that loot-
ing and rioting are not really about the issues (usually but not always
police violence) that initiated them. Riots are instead minimized as crim-
inal disorder, sudden outbursts of “tension,” or somehow objective mark-
ers of the state of race relations or poverty.
At the basis of this criticism is the idea that poor Black or working-
class folks don’t know what they’re doing: that when they riot and loot,
they’re acting outside of reason, outside of “real” struggle. Unlike strikers
or nonviolent protesters, the people who rise up in rage and destruction
are exiled from recognition as a real revolutionary subject, as people.
Philosopher Sylvia Wynter critiqued this notion harshly when analyzing
the LA riots:

```
This category [of the New Poor], unlike the working class jobholders,
cannot be seen, within the economic logic of our present organiza-
tion of knowledge, as contributors to the process of production. .  . .
this New Poor, seduced too, like all of us, by the clamor of adver-
tisements which urge them to consume, so that frustrated in their
consumption goals, they turn on one another, mutilate and kill each
other, or “damage themselves with alcohol and drugs” convinced of
their own worthlessness, or in brief episodes of eruption, “fire the
ghettoes, riot, looting whatever they can lay their hands on,” means
that today’s intellectuals, whilst they feel and express their pity, refrain
from proposing to marry their thought with this particular variety of
human suffering.
```
Instead, Wynter goes on, the rising of these masses has created the
possibility of thinking through a new, revolutionary ethics. “The eruption

. . . in South Central Los Angeles has again opened a horizon from which
to spearhead the speech of a new frontier of knowledge able to move us
toward a new, correlated human species, and eco-systemic, ethic.”^12


```
Introduction 13
```
It is Wynter’s admonition to marry our thought, learning, and theo-
rizing to this group and their actions that shapes the work of this book.
Any meaningful forms of struggle derive from the oppressed commu-
nities that need that struggle most, not from the minds, forms, or theories
of the most successful activists or revolutionaries. As much as any of us
can, rioters and looters know exactly what they’re doing. This book, the
thinking and study I’ve done here and the essay it expands on, would
have been impossible without the uprising in Ferguson. The rebels of
Ferguson have taught me more than I can ever hope to teach, and this
book is meant as an act of gratitude to them for that teaching.

If riots are seen as inchoate, senseless outpourings of anger
and resentment, it is also a commonplace that famous historical riots
“give birth” to movements. The Stonewall riots gave birth to the gay lib-
eration movement; the storming of the Bastille gave birth to the French
Revolution; the Boston Tea Party, the American Revolution. This, of
course, is just meant as a simple claim of cause and effect, a rhetorical
flourish. But birth is in fact an excellent metaphor for rioting and its rela-
tion to social movement and revolution.
Homo sapiens are quite unlucky evolutionarily. In almost all mam-
mals, pregnancy and birth are safe and simple processes: gestating moth-
ers basically never die in childbirth. Indeed, if there are insufficient
resources or the gestator is unable to care for a baby at that moment for
some reason, the fetus can easily be aborted. But in humans, birth is vio-
lent and dangerous, life-threatening to both gestator and fetus.^13
With that understanding in mind, we can begin to analyze riots as
births. Riots are violent, extreme, and femme as fuck: they rip, tear, burn,
and destroy to give birth to a new world. They can emerge from rising
tensions and lead to nothing—a miscarriage—or be the height and end
point of a given movement. In most instances, however, they transform
and build a nascent moment into a movement: rioting, as the Black trans
women of Stonewall showed us, is a form of queer birth.


14 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

As a mode of struggle, riots are marked by many characteristics tra-
ditionally defined as feminine: not driven by rational argumentation or
“proper” political dialogue, they are instead driven by desire, affect, rage,
and pain. They are disordered, emotional, and chaotic. Importantly, too,
riots struggle within the sphere of social reproduction: looting makes day-
to-day life easier by changing the price of goods to zero, relieves pressure
by spreading wealth within the community, and reinforces bonds of sol-
idarity and kinship through mutual struggle and action.^14 It is important
to remember that, for the most part, riots are experienced as celebration,
as joyous and cathartic releases of emotion: police and politicians who
enter riot zones often cite this atmosphere as the thing that terrifies them
the most.^15 But riots are also driven by anger and loss. They emerge as
an alternative form of care and remembrance for those the state’s patriar-
chal violence has destroyed: rising up in mourning for lost children and
in outrage at the domination of daily life. They can be ugly, bloody, and
frightening.
They are often protective, defensive struggles, but they are always
about reproducing a community; as the study of riots in the United States
makes clear, one of the main aftereffects of riots is a sense of unity, togeth-
erness, and joy not normally experienced in the urban neighborhood, a
unity that leads to the blossoming of dozens of political, social, and eco-
nomic projects. Riots are communicative, but unlike protest, they do not
aim their speech at those in power, at leaders or the state; instead, they
are a form of direct communication and knowledge transfer among those
outside the traditional avenues of power. As Black Panther Party minister
of defense Huey P. Newton put it, “In Watts the economy and property
of the oppressor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the
oppressor tried in his press to whitewash the activities of the Black broth-
ers, the real nature and cause of the activity was communicated to every
Black community.”^16
Conceiving of riots as birth does not manage to contain everything
important or worth understanding about riots—it is not a perfect or total
metaphor. But it can help us to understand and analyze the role rioting
has in movement and revolution and the way that riots work for their
participants and the towns and cities where they occur. Rather than see-

ing riots as either totally apolitical, chaotic, or beside the point, instead
of seeing them as one-off rebellions, uprisings, or insurrections that have
little interaction with everyday forms of social transformation, we can
instead see them as crucial moments in the course of revolution and as
fundamentally transformative experiences for everyone involved.
And it is this book’s contention that we need a total transformation of
our society. The society we live in under capitalism is entirely structured
around the production and circulation of commodities. It is a cruel sys-
tem, built for the creation and reification of things, not for the flourish-
ing of people. Commodities are not just any things, but a special kind:
goods and services that can be given a price and sold for more than it
cost to make them so that they produce more value, an excess: profits.
Under capitalism, those profits go to the owner of the “means of produc-
tion.” But the owner doesn’t and can’t make commodities on his own; he
must have people—workers—run his factory, farm his land, or excavate
his mine. Rather than sharing the profits among the people who created
them, however, the owner keeps as much as he can, instead paying work-
ers a wage, almost always the lowest he can get away with, in exchange for
the workers’ time and effort. In other words, he exploits them. The profits
he gains from their work he uses to live lavishly and to invest in more
commodity production, increasing the amount of profits he can grab.
The workers get the privilege of not starving to death.
This is all completely natural to us: in our daily lives, we don’t often
question that a store or factory owner should be allowed to steal the profits
we create when we work or that we should have to spend money to have
things people like us created. We don’t question that we should have to
work for a boss and pay a landlord to keep our stomachs full and a roof
over our heads. We accept that the police and the state, through laws,
courts, and violent armed action, guarantee that the owners of stores,
companies, and apartment buildings can take our money and time on
their terms, and that the boss can fire us and the police can evict us, arrest
us, or even kill us if we try to live otherwise.
But this society built around the “natural” laws of commodities and
profits is both historically novel and relatively young. It is also structurally
unambiguously colonial and white supremacist. For three hundred years,


16 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

as capitalism and commodity society developed in this hemisphere, the
great wealth of the European empires was built on slave-produced com-
modities: the silver mined from Peru and Mexico, the sugar and tobacco
raised in the Caribbean, the cotton grown in the American South. African
people were enslaved to produce commodities on lands stolen through
the genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. The two great
forms of property of the New World were land and slaves, both racialized.
Historian of settler colonialism Patrick Wolfe argues that as the concepts
of the commodity and private property were established, the primal, ideal
commodity was the enslaved African—she existed exclusively for the fur-
ther production of commodities and profits—and the purest property
was stolen Indigenous land—it could be exploited, profited from, and
expanded without concern for its historical and social role.^17 It was the
wealth of the New World that produced sufficient surplus for the creation
of capitalism.
Racial settler colonialism is thus at the core of all modern notions of
property. All our beliefs about the righteousness of property, ownership,
and commodity production are built on the history of anti-Black violence
and settler-colonial extraction. The right to property is innately, structur-
ally white supremacist: support for white supremacy involves a commit-
ment to property and the commodity form.
To protect this system of property and commodity, to stabilize this
racist violence and patriarchal domination, the owners and ruling classes
organized and developed nation-states to enforce their will where the
“laws” of the market failed to do so. Their particularly novel innovation
for this task was the police, the first citywide bureaucracies in the West,
evolved from slave patrols and colonial administrators, and instituted to
protect property, control urban crowds, and repress slave revolts.
Looting, especially when committed by racialized people rising up
against the police and the state, cuts straight through the heart of that
history. It shows that goods can be had for free if we all fight together,
and that we would be able to live without a wage if we freely shared the
products of society. It publicly and communally disregards the store own-
er’s property rights and demonstrates that those rights are only upheld by
the violence of the police. That is why looting, which is, after all, akin


```
Introduction 17
```
to mass shoplifting, is treated as a crime deserving of the death penalty:
during riots, police shoot looters on sight. The police exist to prevent
Black people and poor people from threatening rich white people’s prop-
erty rights: abolishing property is a direct attack on their power.
In striking a blow against the laws of the commodity, looters also
strike against white supremacy: in an antipolice uprising for Black lib-
eration, looting is a directly effective and sensible tactic. No wonder it is
so despised.
To support the arguments and claims made here, to understand the
use of looting at this moment and in the future, this book takes the per-
haps paradoxical-seeming turn toward history, more specifically the his-
tory of looting, from slavery to the present. In doing so, I follow in the
footsteps of the Black Radical Tradition, as well as many other (some-
times overlapping) veins of liberatory and revolutionary thought, from
Indigenous and anticolonial thinkers to anarchist and communist revo-
lutionary traditions.
Throughout his life, across his body of work, James Baldwin returned
again and again to a certain way of reckoning with history: “History . . .
is not merely something to be read. And it does not refer merely, or even
principally, to the past. On the contrary, the great force of history comes
from the fact that we carry it within us, are controlled by it in many ways,
and history is literally present in all we do.” For Christina Sharpe, scholar
of English literature and Black studies, Black life and racial capitalism to-
day must be understood as existing “in the wake” of the Middle Passage,
in the ongoing processes, violences, and social forms of anti-Blackness
initiated in that genocidal kidnapping across the Atlantic and echoing
down into the present. As a reflection of these facts, political prisoner
Mumia Abu-Jamal has said, “True history tells us more about today than
about yesterday.”^18
This conception of history is consonant with the Jewish tradition in
which I was raised. Every year at Passover, one of the two most important
holidays of the calendar, Jews gather together with family and friends
to retell the story of Jewish enslavement and Moses-led deliverance in
Egypt. This ritual, the annual act of remembering the horrors of slavery
and the joys of emancipation, is one of the most important traditions

holding a diasporic people together for three thousand years. If this has
been the long historical wake of slavery and emancipation for Jews, how
could we begin to understand the ongoing effects of four centuries of
industrial chattel slavery, which only ended—and even then, only tech-
nically—a mere 150 years ago? It appeared to me that any Jewish ethics
must directly prioritize Black liberation.
Without reckoning with the direct, lived, present past, no movement
can truly change, heal, or care for our present, let alone produce a liber-
ated future. And studying history has other advantages: with the benefit
of an overview of long historical durations, the accumulation of docu-
ments, and consistent study, it is in some ways easier to highlight the
meanings and effects of riots.
Studying history also has a vital abolitionist role. Ideology would have
us believe that capitalism, the nation-state, the police, prisons, and other
violent forms of oppression are timeless, infinite facts. If there have always
been police, across cultures, then there can never be a world without
them. But by understanding how recent these things are, and by tracing
strategies of resistance, struggle, and revolt against them, we can begin
to imagine a world otherwise.^19 This book is mostly a work of history,
a history based in the desire to break with this world and destroy all its
monstrous continuities.
But the study of history also has some serious problems and limits,
problems that are doubled in the study of rioting and looting. Resistance
is consistently underreported in the historical record. Those with power
over discourse and documentation, those in the media, universities, gov-
ernment offices, churches, and corporations, prefer not to widely report
or record forms of militant struggle for fear of its spreading and inspiring
others. If they record it, they slander it, underestimate its size or power,
misinterpret it, or exaggerate its failings. Meanwhile rebels and revolu-
tionaries are often illiterate, isolated, imprisoned, killed, or otherwise
prevented from making sure their struggles end up in the archive the
way they lived them. So history must rely on stories passed down through
generations, accounts and interviews with participants, and the work of
radical archivists, historians, and academics.


```
Introduction 19
```
Looting makes this problem of underreporting even deeper. During
the Great Depression, for example, store owners were loath to even report
organized looting to the police for fear that that would help it spread.^20
Few looters, meanwhile, are willing to discuss their own participation in
looting. Rarely asked to speak, they are faced with universal condemna-
tion from friend and foe—not to mention serious legal consequences—
and so they rarely argue their own case in public after the fact.
I am not, myself, a trained historian with institutional access. As
such, my methods have largely been to rely on secondary sources, online
archives and videos, and the work of other historians, academics, and
revolutionaries.^21 I have also focused almost entirely on looting in the
so-called United States of America, a serious flaw that it would take at
least another few book-length studies to correct. I hope that the effect of
encountering the stories, theories, and accounts I’ve traced and gathered
together might help comrades in the struggle and inspire others to do the
work, research, and critique necessarily lacking herein.
We are again living through historically transformative times, in an
era of looting, of riot, revolt, and revolution. This time we face a resur-
gent global Far Right and ecological disaster beyond our comprehension.
We cannot afford to leave the revolution half-done: the planet simply
cannot survive it. But we needn’t be afraid. The future is ours to take. We
just need to loot it.

chapter one (^) | THE RACIAL ROOTS OF PROPERTY
T
he United States of America is built on African slavery and
Indigenous genocide. This simple fact is the premise from which any
honest study of American history must begin. Property, state, govern-
ment, and economy in America rise from these pillars of racialized dis-
possession and violence—slavery and genocide—and any change made
that does not upend this history, that does not tear these pillars to the
ground in a process of decolonization and reparations, does not deserve
the name justice.
Although US history is predominantly the story of the continuation of
this violence, it is also full of moments, movements, and images of a life
lived otherwise, of resistance, liberation, and transformation. One of the
most consistent images from this other world to come, one that terrifies
even many of those who claim to be partisans of that world, is of the Black
looter, who finds her antecedent in the escaped and fugitive slave.
To fully understand this, it is necessary to trace how this image devel-
oped, to see how white supremacy and the racial regime of property—what
preeminent historian Cedric Robinson calls racial capitalism—evolved
out of Euro-American chattel slavery and (ongoing) settler colonialism.^1


22 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

The first slaves in the “New World” were not Africans but Indigenous
Americans. Columbus had barely disembarked in the Bahamas before
deciding that the people there “would make fine servants.” It was Indige-
nous slaves who built the great wealth of the Spanish empire, mining sil-
ver from Potosí in Bolivia and from the Mexican plateau throughout the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Much of this specie was siphoned
off by Dutch, Genoan, and German bankers and merchants, who had
grasped the nature of the coming market economy much better than
the Spanish monarchy did.* This mineral wealth was the material basis
and political focus of European mercantilism, the system that would give
rise to the bourgeoisie and lay the groundwork for industrial capitalism.
This wealth was produced by enslaved Americans (and Africans) under
a genocidal slave labor regime that would reduce the Indigenous popu-
lation of the Spanish colonies from fifty million at “first contact” to four
million by the end of the seventeenth century. From its very beginnings,
capitalism was built on the backs and the graves of the enslaved.^2
In what would become known as the United States, the first colonial
slave trade also traded in Americans, because it was considered best prac-
tice to ship Indigenous “servants” far away from their native land, where
their knowledge of the local terrain and proximity to friends and family
encouraged both escape and violent retribution. Thus, Indigenous peo-
ples were swapped between New England and the Carolinas or sold from
the continental colonies to the West Indies, and vice versa. This trade was
crucial for the early colonies; Indigenous servants were one of the main
exports during the first century of British colonial rule.^3
Despite these precautions, Indigenous escape, insurrection, raiding,
and war proved a constant threat to profit and stability. Combined with
the fact that they were a “labor supply” succumbing to genocidal depop-
ulation caused by both disease and systematic colonial policy, the Indige-
nous peoples of America were only temporarily the enslaved basis of the
British colonial economy.

*Indeed, the fact that the Spanish paid in specie and thus increased the “real” wealth of
England would be a major defense made by English slave traders of selling Africans to
the Spanish colonies, despite the fact that, according to the economic commonsense of
the period of mercantilism, trading with opposing empires was to be avoided at all costs.

The Racial Roots of Property 23
```
This, historian Patrick Wolfe argues, is consistent with the labor logic
of settler colonialism. A settler colony relies on the promise of “open
land” or “virgin territory” as the material and ideological basis of its exis-
tence. The problem is that this “open land” is always already occupied.
Thus, to capture the land, the settler colony must eliminate the Indig-
enous population through genocide, first by outright murder, later, by
cultural destruction and assimilation. Yet, at the same time, laborers are
required to transform that “virgin territory” into value for the colonizers,
and a large and ever-expanding population of laborers is required to pro-
duce profits.
These two requirements—genocide of the Indigenous to take their
land and justify the colony’s existence and the expansion of the pool of
laborers to increase profits—are obviously incompatible. As a result, In-
digenous labor cannot be relied upon in a settler colony. Thus, in the
early continental colonies, the colonists emphasized Indigenous “unsuit-
ability” for the brutality of plantation labor, an unsuitability that would
not, of course, protect Indigenous Americans from continued forced la-
bor, dispossession, and ethnic cleansing.^4
But more labor was desperately needed by the planters and merchants
of the colonies, who had come to the New World, after all, to get rich.
The answer to this problem, for the first sixty or so years of what would
become the United States, was largely found in the system of indentured
servitude. Working alongside enslaved African and Indigenous peoples,
white and Black “indentured servants” toiled in the tobacco fields and
built the towns of colonial America.
But these servants were not yet distinguished as “white” and “Black.”
Though the word Negro appears in Virginia’s colonial records, it is used
as a national, not racial, descriptor, deployed in the same way that peo-
ple’s nationality (Scotch, Irish, English) was.^5 In this “national” definition
that used “Negro” to interchangeably refer to Africans of any provenance,
be they from the Spanish Caribbean or recently kidnapped from West
Africa, we can see that the collapsing of various African nationalities into
Blackness already existed. But whiteness had not yet been fully formed
in the early seventeenth century, nor the fatal equation white-over-black
that would give both racial identities their full force in America.^6


24 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

These indentured servants came to the colonies with contracts last-
ing generally from three to seven years, during which time they were to
serve at the absolute dictate of their master. After these terms expired,
they were promised not only freedom but also land and wages from their
former masters, called freedom dues. But for the first four decades of the
US-American colonies, working conditions were so dire that few servants
survived the length of their contracts.
In many ways, the peculiarly American systems of African slavery
would be tested and designed around indentured servitude, which would
expand rapidly during the tobacco boom in the mid-seventeenth centu-
ry.* Servants were bought, sold, traded, kidnapped, or awarded to early
colonists by the Crown, other settlers, and various companies.^7 Though
some servants signed on voluntarily, hoping for a new start in America,
many were exiled criminals, orphaned children, or anti-English rebels
captured in Scotland and Ireland. Many, too, were kidnapped off the
streets of English cities by a particularly hated class of entrepreneurs
called “spirits.”† Laboring on monocultural plantations, servants were
beaten, starved, branded, maimed, and killed with near impunity. Even
some of the horrors of the Middle Passage were practiced on English
servants, who, at the height of the servant trade from 1650 to 1680, would

*I should note here that the servant trade, though it took on many of the aspects of the
African slave trade, never reached the size and levels of technical organization present
in the African trade in later centuries. Nor would it last nearly as long or touch even a
fraction as many people. The servant trade was over before the end of the eighteenth
century. Even at its zenith, European servants were never enslaved indefinitely or hered-
itarily, could represent themselves in court, and became full citizens after their inden-
ture. There exists a white supremacist myth about the horrors of the “Irish slave trade”
that contends that enslavement of Irish people lasted well into the nineteenth century
and was equally as violent and vicious as the African slave trade. This is a historical false-
hood—a white supremacist manipulation of the facts of indentured servitude. For more
on the Irish slave trade myth, see the work of Liam Hogan, in particular: “Debunking the
Irish Slaves Meme,” a four-part series on Medium.
†Spirits would befriend and feed the gullible, drunk, or vulnerable on English city streets,
who would wake up the next morning not in their new friend’s home but in a cage, to be
shipped to America (hence the phrase “spirited away”). So common and so hated were
spirits that in the late seventeenth century, to accuse someone on a Bristol or London
street of being one was sufficient to start a riot.

be “packed like herrings,” locked belowdecks for weeks with barely any
food and only a few feet to move.^8
Similarly, Africans in the colonies had not all been reduced to chattel
slavery. Though life terms were sometimes enforced in the Caribbean
colonies in this period, many Africans in the early United States were
not enslaved for life, but only under indenture contracts, and eventually
went on to receive freedom dues, own land, even own white servants. As
historian Barbara Jeanne Fields writes, “African slaves during the years
between 1619 and 1661 enjoyed rights that, in the nineteenth century,
not even free black people could claim.”^9 African and European servants
worked together, married, and escaped tobacco plantations together. It
was not some preracial utopia of equality but rather a period of violent
domination and frontier colonialism in which the specific tenets of white
supremacy had not yet been fully developed, what Lerone Bennett Jr.
calls an “equality of oppression.”^10
As the seventeenth century wore on, conditions in the colonies im-
proved, and indentured servants started surviving their terms—and re-
ceiving their freedom dues—much more regularly, thus becoming more
expensive. Plantation owners tried to squeeze more profit out of their
workers, finding increasingly spurious reasons to extend the length of
servitude, driving servants harder and harder in the fields. However, as
Fields argues, English servants were crucially “backed up” by the history
of struggle between British laborer and landowner, by centuries of con-
flict and negotiation passed down into the present as culture, precedent,
and norms of treatment. Furthermore, news of servant mistreatment that
reached England made it harder, and therefore more expensive, to cap-
ture or recruit new servants. There was thus a limit to how much planters
could exploit English workers: they could not be made slaves for life;
their progeny would not be born into permanent bondage.^11
Africans had no such power in the English colonies, no such backup.
And enslaving someone for life became more ghoulishly attractive when
“life” meant more than just a few miserable years. This logic was rein-
forced by the threat of servant revolt. Bacon’s Rebellion, the largest re-
bellion in the pre-Revolutionary colonies, taking place in 1676–1677, saw
armed and aggrieved free Englishmen, joined by slaves and servants, loot


26 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

and burn the capital of Virginia and briefly take over the colony. This re-
volt, in which freemen joined servants in insurrection, increased distrust
of English servants among the planters and colonial governorship. Thus,
“the importation of African slaves in larger and larger numbers made
it possible to maintain a sufficient corps of plantation laborers without
building up an explosive charge of armed Englishmen resentful at being
denied the rights of Englishmen and disposing of the material and polit-
ical resources to make their resentment felt.”^12
Though African slaves were present in the colonies from the be-
ginning, “the law did not formally recognize the condition of perpetual
slavery or systematically mark out servants of African descent for special
treatment until 1661.”^13 By the end of the seventeenth century, African
laborers were cheaper, served life terms, and had children born into slav-
ery. Without the same history of struggle and thus a customary level of
expected treatment, an ocean away from their comrades, families, and so-
cieties, Africans were alone in America. White and Indigenous servitude
would continue through the eighteenth century—nearly 10 percent of
the white population of the colonies were still servants at the beginning
of the Revolution—but they were slowly and surely being replaced on
the plantations by African laborers.^14
If, legally and socially, there was a space and time in which race-based
chattel slavery did not exist in the colonies, could American capitalism
have developed some other way? Some claim that Europeans acting as
tenant farmers, yeomen, and merchants might have been perfectly via-
ble in Virginia and the Carolinas, much like they were in the Northern
colonies, and that, therefore, slavery was not necessary. But the Northern
colonies’ economies were built almost entirely upon exporting their food,
livestock, and small commodities to the sugar colonies of the West In-
dies, which, as a result of slavery-based plantation monoculture, did not
produce enough of their own. Northern merchants, meanwhile, made
much of their wealth building ships for the Triangle Trade and making
rum and molasses from slave-produced sugar. New York City’s insurance
and financial institutions—Wall Street—were largely built through pro-
viding capital for the slave trade. Without the support of the continental
colonies, Britain could never have developed its sugar monopoly, but the


```
The Racial Roots of Property 27
```
reverse is also true: without the sugar monopoly, the continental colonies
would have ended in failure. Quite simply, there is no American econ-
omy, North or South, without slavery.^15
Indeed, the incredible profits reaped from the English slave econo-
mies in the Caribbean and on the North American continent—a surplus
of 50 percent or more on investments made by British capital—were the
cash basis of the growth of industrial production occurring in England
and the European continent through the period, and, thus, a key factor
in the growth of European capitalism. Planters deposited their incredible
wealth with bankers and bought new luxury goods from merchants, who
would then reinvest this money in infrastructure, entrepreneurial firms,
and agricultural improvements in England. Back in England, where the
majority of the population was still transitioning out of subsistence agri-
culture, the goods produced in the colonies helped form an incentive to
drive peasants into cash markets and capitalist labor relations. As histo-
rian Robin Blackburn writes, “The availability of tobacco, brightly co-
loured cotton goods, sweetened beverages, cakes and preserves, helped to
tempt Britons into greater participation in market exchanges and greater
reliance on wages, salaries and fees.”^16 Thus slavery strengthened the En-
glish bourgeoisie, enriched British and continental banking and mer-
chant firms, and helped create the modern English working class.* It’s
not just America: industrial capitalism is impossible without New World
slavery.
But capitalism is a system ideologically committed to free labor—
though the freedom in “free labor” is the freedom to starve. The max-
imum development of profit for the bourgeoisie relies on a free labor
market, on the reproduction of a proletariat with nothing to sell but their
labor power. It is necessary that individual capitalists be able to manip-
ulate their workers’ labor hours, for example, via hiring and firing, to

*As Cedric Robinson points out, even this “English working class” was hardly a unified
subject but was, as it formed, deeply riven by racial hierarchy, with Irish laborers at
the bottom, and Scottish, Welsh, and more recently West Indian and Asian workers be-
low “English” workers proper. These divisions, though briefly overcome in the Chartist
movement, were a crucial factor in limiting English working class radicalism in the
nineteenth century (Cedric Robinson, Black Marxism, 2nd ed. [Chapel Hill: University
of North Carolina Press, 2000], 45–52).

respond to developments in the productive forces and swings in demand
within the market.
What Southern agriculture discovered is that this can be achieved
without free laborers. Plantation owners frequently “hired out” farm-
hands to other owners or temporarily hired skilled slaves from other ar-
eas or industries. Southern cities of the nineteenth century were filled
with communities of such laborers, who earned a wage much like a
free worker did, the difference being they did so only at their enslavers’
pleasure and they were required to turn over most of their income every
week—as many proletarians in America today turn over all their wages to
debtors and landlords.
Frederick Douglass spent some of his bondage working as a ship
caulker in Baltimore and, like many others, deceived his enslaver about
how much he was actually making, thus secreting funds for his escape.
Many of these workers lived miles distant from their enslavers—indeed,
it is precisely these urban communities of relatively independent Black
people that would lead to the earliest development of police departments,
as gangs of slave catchers evolved into formalized slave patrols designed
to keep these “slave quarters” under surveillance and control.^17
Still, the main way capitalists increase profits is to drive down the cost
of production, of which the largest part is usually the price of labor. This is
done by maintaining a large body of unemployed proletarians, thus mak-
ing workers replaceable and allowing employers to fire insubordinate,
disabled, sick, or pregnant workers, while using the threat of unemploy-
ment to coerce the rest into working more hours for less pay. Agricultural
slave labor, therefore, intuitively seems hard to make cheaper. With no
threat of losing their wage nor any real promise of advancement, and
with no unemployed people liable to take a slave’s position—slavery is a
system of 100 percent employment, after all—the enslaved tend to work
the bare minimum required to avoid punishment and are less reliably
coerced by speedups and expanded managerial demands.
But research increasingly reveals that, rather than merely delay profit
growth, this “dilemma” of enslaved labor saw overseers develop some of
capitalism’s most powerful (and erroneously considered modern) man-


```

```
agement techniques. The earliest examples of employee surveillance, in-
dividual performance assessment, traceable units of production, detailed
record keeping, and employee incentivization—all key concepts in mod-
ern management theory—occurred on slave plantations.^18
Nevertheless, certain models of historical teleology persist in call-
ing slavery “pre-capitalist,” or just primitive accumulation, a necessary
condition for capitalism’s growth but something ultimately overcome by
actual, real industrial capitalism. This relies on a definition of capitalism
that considers the wage the most important defining feature of capital-
ism, a definition that underestimates the importance, for example, of the
totally necessary unwaged reproductive labor that predominantly falls
to women under capitalism: housework, emotional care, and the literal
reproduction of the working class. In these models, unwaged labor be-
comes not a central component of capitalism but a supporting side effect,
an arbitrary management tactic.
Other scholars have argued that capitalism eventually abolished slav-
ery as inefficient, unprofitable, or immoral. But they ignore the fact that,
even though formal slavery and the slave trade ended in the Americas
in the nineteenth century, the enslavement of prison populations in the
United States continues to this day, not to mention that colonial slave
regimes in Africa and Southeast Asia expanded vastly at the very moment
of American emancipation. When Brazil abolished slavery in 1888—the
last country in the Americas to do so—King Leopold II of Belgium’s
genocidal domination of the Congo was but three years old. From 1885
to 1908, almost all the people of the Congo Basin, along with thousands
kidnapped from other parts of Africa, were forced into slavery.
The sinisterly named “Congo Free State” saw fifteen million people
worked to death on rubber plantations, starved by monoculture- produced
famine and drought, murdered by colonial overseers for failing to meet
rubber or ivory quotas, killed on forced marches, or executed by militias
for rising in rebellion. The rubber thus accumulated enabled the mass
production of the bicycles and automobiles that would transform daily
life in the Global North. Across the nineteenth and well into the twenti-
eth century, capitalist development relied on enslaved, colonized labor.


30 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Though one of capitalism’s defining features is free labor, unfree and
unwaged labor are endemic features of capitalist profit production, not
holdovers from previous economic systems.
Still, slavery and capitalism are not identical regimes: slavery has ex-
isted across cultures and time periods, under various names, with differ-
ing centrality, at different levels of violence, and supporting divergent
societies, whereas capitalism is a modern development that tends toward
a global and homogenous social organization. And there is no question
that the experience of the enslaved is fundamentally different from that
of the worker. So then, how do we reconcile these two separable yet ma-
terially integrated and coproductive regimes without simply collapsing
one into the other and thus losing sight of their specificities? One helpful
step is to recognize the absolute centrality of race to the development of
private property, and vice versa.
Racial domination is not a by-product of capitalism, nor one of a num-
ber of available strategies plucked from the ether of potential management
paradigms, conveniently to hand. As we have seen, slavery and settler colo-
nialism were necessary components of the formation and maintenance of
capitalism. And slavery and settler colonialism couldn’t be carried out, day
by day, instinctively and across centuries, by millions of Euro- Americans,
both rich and poor, without the formal, legal, psychological, and ideolog-
ical frameworks of racism, white supremacy, and anti-Blackness.
Many historians have shown that strong, explicit racist ideology does
not appear in the historical record in America until the revolutionary pe-
riod, when the rights of man (and it is indeed man) became the defining
philosophy of US politics. If the rights to liberty and property are inalien-
able, then what to do about all these people who are, very clearly, not in
possession of liberty or the capacity of property ownership? What of these
people who are the property of the men claiming all men have inalien-
able rights? Much like gender naturalizes and “explains” why women
are not granted these inalienable liberties, the white Founding Fathers
resolved this contradiction through race: Black men are not men, not
really. As Fields writes, Black people “resolved the contradiction more
straightforwardly by calling for the abolition of slavery.”^19

The Racial Roots of Property 31
```
This contradiction finds its roots deep in European history and phi-
losophy. The emergence of modern, explicit racial ideology is built on
centuries of implicit racial and racialized power, a form of power abso-
lutely fundamental to creating the division of labor, the construction of
“Europe,” whiteness, and the very possibility of private property.
Cedric Robinson demonstrates that racialized hierarchies were cru-
cial to medieval European notions of nobility and the formation of serf
and slave populations—for example, in Russia, serfs were imagined to
have black bones, as opposed to the white ones of nobles. Myths about
the bloodlines of Normans, Irish, and Scots justified differing levels of
work and privilege in medieval and mercantilist England. Proto-racial
hierarchies, as framed around notions of barbarians and outsiders, were
also the key tool for structuring and disciplining the mercenary armies
and the immigrant and migratory working populations of sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century mercantilist statecraft.^20
The contradiction between racial power and the liberal concept of
inalienable rights to life, liberty, and property is visible throughout Amer-
ican history. One striking example occurred one hundred years before
the Revolution, in the racialized conception of freedom visible in Ba-
con’s Rebellion. In the infamous 1676 Virginia uprising, enslaved and
servant, Black and white fought side by side, and some historians there-
fore celebrate this rebellion as a proto-democratic and revolutionary up-
rising. Much like the Civil War was about slavery, but with neither side
originally fighting for emancipation, so was Bacon’s Rebellion originally
about “Indian policy,” with a disagreement about how quickly genocide
of the Indigenous people should be carried out. And, as in the Civil War,
slaves joined the fight, changing the meaning of the struggle in their at-
tempt to win emancipation.
The conflict was sparked by Nathaniel Bacon, a backcountry planter
and settler living on the border of “Indian territory.” He wanted to seize
more land, and to do so advocated a more aggressive and immediate
genocidal policy than that of the colony: total war on the natives. Berke-
ley, the English governor of the colony, disagreed. He recognized the
strategic imperative to maintain provisional and relative peace—until,


32 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

of course, the next time the colony needed to expand westward—rather
than risk an all-out war they would almost certainly lose.
Bacon ignored Berkeley, and in the first act of the rebellion, in May
1676, gathered a militia to attack a group of Indigenous Americans. Not
even attacking a “hostile” nation, Bacon’s militia massacred a village
of the British-allied Occaneechi. Governor Berkeley declared Bacon’s
mustering of the militia illegal. In response, armed supporters of Bacon
stormed the capital and forced Berkeley to change his ruling and approve
Bacon’s commission as militia leader. This indicated the functional end
of Berkeley’s power, and Berkeley and his governmental assembly would
eventually flee the capital.
Bacon’s Assembly, the first and only formal government of the re-
bellion, was held in June 1676. It passed a number of new acts into colo-
nial law, the most famous removing property restrictions on suffrage and
giving democratic electoral control over parish priests to all free men of
the colony, regardless of race. Bacon’s sudden death in October 1676, fol-
lowed by a series of military defeats—ending in a famous last stand made
by a mix of Black and white servant-rebels—concluded the uprising, and
the acts of Bacon’s Assembly were repealed. Still, some historians hold
up their expansion of voting rights and popular control as examples of
early democratic policy in America.
Bacon’s Rebellion is thus seen as an antecedent of the America Rev-
olution. And, indeed, it is, though not in the way its defenders usually
intend but because the first three acts of Bacon’s Assembly all focused
on pursuing total war against Indigenous Americans and confiscating In-
digenous lands theoretically protected by British treaty.* European and
Black servants fought together in the rebellion, which points to the fact
that whiteness had not fully developed by then, but we can see in the first
three acts of Bacon’s Assembly that racialized structures of freedom-for-
some were already well established.
This contradiction, between legal and social structures of racial op-
pression and democratic liberty, is the central epistemological frame-

*J. Sakai calls this contradiction “the dialectical unity of democracy and oppression in
developing settler Amerika” (Settlers [Chicago: Morningstar Press, 1989]).

work of the modern European worldview. As philosopher Sylvia Wynter
demonstrates, it is the constitutive principle of Rational Man; for Wyn-
ter, the key transition from feudal thought to enlightened reason centers
around the replacement of God versus Man as the structuring dichotomy
of society with that of reason versus lack of reason. Because, under feudal-
ism, all people were subservient to the law of God, everything in “nature”
served to verify the glory, power, and existence of God: nobles and kings
were divinely ordained, the sun rotated around God’s earth, and so forth.
But once nature was no longer needed to perform this affirmation of the
divine,

```
another mode of nature, human nature, would now be installed in
its place. The representation of a naturally ordered distribution of de-
grees of reason between different human groups enable what might
be called a homo-ontological principle of Sameness/Difference,
figured as a by/nature difference of superiority/inferiority between
groups, and could now function tautologically as the verifying proof
of a . . . naturally caused status-organizing principle, a principle based
on differential endowment of Reason (rather than of noble Blood)
and verified dynamically in the empirical reality of the order.^21
```
The emergence of reason and the subsequent reification of reason as
the fundamental attribute of human nature is therefore completely pre-
mised on the creation of hierarchies of reasonable and unreasonable peo-
ple. The enlightened, reasoned man can only exist in distinction to the
(African, Indigenous, nonmale) person who lacks reason; the idea of uni-
versal humanity is premised on human difference from and opposition
to the less- or nonhuman person, a racialized and racializing difference.
In practice, this means that anything is justified in introducing reason
to those who lack it, because, lacking it, that person is cast outside what
Wynter calls the “sanctified universe of obligation”; in other words, they
are not entitled to those same protections colloquially referred to as basic
human decency. This principle, “verified dynamically in the empirical
reality of the order,” is the ideology of progress: domination, colonialism,
and the expansion of capitalism become justice, the end of poverty, and


34 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

the spread of culture, science, and truth. As Wynter shows, in the colo-
nial period this humanist structure was used to justify genocide of Indige-
nous Americans. Spanish colonists encountering what they understood as
senseless human sacrifice (as opposed to rational, sensible wars of religion
or conquest) used it as proof that the Indigenous societies they confronted
lacked reason. In the name of God, yes, but as He is now the God of rea-
son and un-reason’s innocent victims, Spanish colonists claimed they not
only could but also were morally obligated to conquer this society.
This is the same logic that allows Bacon’s Rebellion to expand the
franchise while advocating wiping out the “primitive” Indians. The con-
cepts of the individual and the human that constitute the basis for all
rights, for all law, for “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” were
already and always built on a racial definition. But the phrase is an adap-
tation of a John Locke quotation that did not mention happiness: it was
“life, liberty, and the pursuit of estate.” This inalienable right to “estate,”
to property, would be the marker of the kind of subject recognized by this
new government. But this also works in the other direction: to be able
to own property is to be human, so those who cannot own property—be
they enslaved, Indigenous, or even the children and wives of settlers—
need not be recognized as fully human by the state.
In the early decades of the colonial era, it was illegal to enslave Chris-
tians in perpetuity. But as the theological explanation of the world gave
way to reason, the justification for enslaving people also transformed:
only barbaric, uncivilized, and “reason-lacking” people can be enslaved.
And, as Wynter shows us, because this is a tautological structure that ver-
ifies itself through what has already come to pass, Africans, who were by
the turn of the seventeenth century “easier” to enslave than Europeans,
became just such a “reason-lacking” people. Africans came to stand for
lack of reason itself. Because people lacking reason were not human, they
were only capable of being property, not owning it. Although the more
liberal-minded settlers believed that with education and uplift some select
Black people might become capable of humanity, they did not challenge
the basic framework by which most Africans were deemed inhuman.
Black people became, legally, socially, and ideologically, property.


```
The Racial Roots of Property 35
```
American power and property developed along two racial axes: the
genocidal dispossession of the indigene and the kidnap and enslavement
of the African. As historian Patrick Wolfe writes in Traces of History, this
is core to the worldview of John Locke, preferred property theorist of
the Founding Fathers, who argued “in texts that would profoundly influ-
ence Euro-American colonial ideology, private property accrued from
the admixture of labor and land. As this formula was color-coded on the
colonial ground, Blacks provided the former and Indians the latter.”^22
Property in America is only possible through this racial accumulation.
The stolen land and enslaved people were together by far the most
valuable property in America, from the earliest days of the colonies up to

1860. The establishment in American jurisprudence of absolute rights to
property and the inviolability of contract would occur in an 1810 Supreme
Court ruling, Fletcher v. Peck, that centered around a massive expansion
of slave territory in Georgia. That is why legal scholar Anthony Paul Far-
ley argues that “the black is the apogee of the commodity.” Blackness, he
writes, is a way of marking certain bodies as owners and certain bodies
as owned. Simone Browne calls this mutual process of racialization and
propertification the “making and marking of blackness as property.”^23
    Just as Blackness marks a person as (potential) property, whiteness
also cannot be understood outside of property relations: the character-
istic of “whiteness” is the thing white people have that makes them le-
gal subjects, owners, and human beings. We tend to think of property
as tangible things, items or commodities, although we also understand
ideas of intellectual property and copyright. Property, in other words, also
includes rights, protections, and customs of possession passed down and
ratified through law. Whiteness emerges as the race of people who are
neither Indigenous nor enslavable—national identities are increasingly
collapsed around the distinctions of slave/free and Black/white. As legal
scholar Cheryl Harris writes in her seminal text “Whiteness as Property,”
“Whiteness defined the legal status of a person as slave or free. White
identity conferred tangible and economically valuable benefits and was
jealously guarded as a valued possession, allowed only to those who met a
strict standard of proof.”^24 Property law emerges to codify, formalize, and


36 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

affirm white enslavement of Africans and conquest of the Americas, to
protect, project, and strengthen whiteness.
This can be seen as white settlers came in conflict with Indigenous
landholders. Settlers claimed, absurdly, that they were the “first posses-
sors” of the land. “Only particular forms of possession—those that were
characteristic of white settlement—would be recognized and legiti-
mated. Indian forms of possession were perceived to be too ambiguous
and unclear.”^25 Law develops to codify whiteness and to give technical
description and explanation to the genocide-accomplished fact of settler-
colonial conquest. Access to certain forms of power, legality, and person-
hood—property-in-whiteness—was a prerequisite for access to property
in land or slaves: whiteness became the meta-property from which all
other private property flows and is derived.*
Not only is capitalist development completely reliant on racialized
forms of power, but bourgeois legality itself, enshrining at its center the
right to own property, fundamentally relies on racial structures of human
nature to justify this right. Private property is a racial concept, and race,
a propertarian one.
But what happens when this ultimate commodity, the slave, refuses
to be property? This refusal, practiced over and over again, across and
against the whole history of the United States, expressed in art, music,
poetry, and dance, in religious fervor and revolutionary organization,
in violent confrontation with the state and the cunning avoidance of it,
in prison breaks and intellectual breakthroughs, has not yet been fully
consummated. That is because the owners have always victoriously re-
asserted their great big YES, that yes of the police, the prisons, the plan-
tations, redlining, borders, Jim Crow, failing schools, gang injunctions,
slave patrols, cultural appropriation, housing courts, lynch mobs, unem-
ployment, and the countless other aggressions, micro and macro, that
reassert the commodifying mark every day in all its violence. As Black-
ness became a way to signify and describe those who can be and had
become property, the radical consummation of that refusal would mean

hold—legal ownership of a family’s children and women—was the basis for citizenship.

at minimum the abolition of the entire system under which things can be
commodified. Revolution.
Such a revolution, against white supremacy, property, and their fun-
damental intersection, was taken up by the enslaved of the United States,
en masse, with the strategy of refusal that had proven most successful
across the preceding centuries: escape from the plantation. And though
this revolution would only destroy legal slavery and not everything it
meant, defended, and reproduced, it is evidence of the revolutionary po-
tential of abolishing property, of joining together and expropriating the
owners. The revolutionary potential of looting.

ho freed the enslaved? Any schoolchild can tell you it
was Abraham Lincoln. Most adults would agree, perhaps adding that
it was what the Union fought for in the Civil War.
The social revolution in the South that ended slavery might have
been impossible without the Civil War and the Union Army, and it’s
true that the legal end of chattel slavery was brought about by Lincoln
and the Thirteenth Amendment.* But it was despite the intentions and
desires of Lincoln and the North, not because of them, that the enslaved
achieved emancipation, dragging Lincoln and the Union Army kicking
and screaming behind them. The enslaved freed themselves.
They did so with an act of mass looting and strike that shook the
regime of white supremacist capitalism to its core: they stole themselves
from their masters and, in so doing, abolished a huge percentage of Amer-
ica’s wealth, a wealth, according to historian David Roediger, “equal to
the combined value of all capital invested in manufacturing, railroads,
*The Thirteenth Amendment left an exception allowing forced labor in the situation

and banks, as well as all currency in circulation and all federal expen-
ditures.”^1 Almost entirely illiterate, forcibly barred from gathering and
organizing, ostensibly kept ignorant of current events, they nevertheless
recognized, well before the planters who enslaved them or the Union
generals who would be the instruments of their liberty, what opportunity
the Civil War really held: Jubilee, the end of slavery, and the coming of
their emancipation. They took it.
Though we may question it and struggle against it, our default sense
of history, like our default idea of politics, is a story of leaders, laws and
wars, important dates and formal treaties. Such a historical lens can’t
help but misrecognize the political will and communal intelligence be-
hind the massive, decentralized direct actions that mark all revolutionary
moments. Instead, five hundred thousand enslaved persons escaping in
the span of four years is treated like some individualistic, apolitical phe-
nomenon called “opportunism”—a crime rioters and looters are always
accused of. The history of the Black Atlantic, however, reveals that en-
slaved populations across the centuries have always recognized political
crises among their enslavers as the best moments to organize and get free.
The most famous example of this, of course, is the Haitian revolu-
tion. News of the French Revolution’s beginnings in 1789 sent the French
sugar colony of Saint-Domingue into turmoil. While different political
factions struggled, both in Saint-Domingue and in the revolutionary Na-
tional Assembly back in Paris, the enslaved workers, the vast majority of
the island’s population, watched, waited, and formed a plan of revolt. On
the night of August 21, 1791, the enslaved rose up in a coordinated and
furious attack and, within ten days, had burned dozens of plantations and
taken over the entire Northern Province of the colony.*
These masses would eventually form great armies, overthrowing the
colonial government and taking over the island. By 1804, after defeating
the colonial government, the Spanish, the British, and Napoleon Bona-
parte, the independent Black nation of Haiti had been established. The
Europeans and the United States have never forgotten this history of lib-

*The signal to rise up was famously given a week before, on August 14, at a Vodou cere-
mony in Bois Caïman, attended by representatives from the surrounding plantations and

erty at their expense, and the tiny country of Haiti, the result of the first
victorious anticolonial and antislavery struggle in the Americas, has been
punished by economic sanction, debt, invasion, war, boycott, and neoco-
lonialism ever since.
But it wasn’t only Haitians who used political conflict to break their
bonds. The overthrow of the July Monarchy in 1848 and the rise of the
Republic of France saw an abolitionist government installed in Paris.
Though this new government would formally abolish slavery in the re-
maining French sugar colonies, the enslaved of Martinique did not wait
for Paris’s help. They deserted plantations in the thousands, forcing the
colonial administrators of Martinique and Guadeloupe to abolish slavery
before the order from the new government to do so could arrive across
the Atlantic.^2
In the United States, meanwhile, as many as a hundred thousand
people, near 20 percent of the colonial slave population, escaped slavery
during the course of the American Revolution—including some slaves
of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, fugitives who no doubt
had a more expansive idea of freedom than their enslaving Founding
Fathers—making it the largest slave revolt in United States history until
the Civil War.^3
The American Civil War is largely remembered as a clash of armies,
but its historical meaning and significance were mostly determined by a
social revolution in the South, what W. E. B. Du Bois called the “general
strike of the slaves.” The enslaved rose up, fled the plantation, picked up
arms to destroy their former enslavers, and took history into their hands.
The fight for emancipation in the United States did not begin in the
Civil War, and neither did it end at the war’s conclusion.† The fugitive
escaping slavery is as old as the colonies. Her history is necessary to un-
derstanding the course of and possibilities for revolution in the United
States.

†Nor, indeed, did the Civil War simply begin in 1861 at Fort Sumter and end at Appomat-
tox in 1865. For the “Civil War” here, I use Du Bois’s expanded period of revolutionary
transition and social instability, from 1854—with Bloody Kansas and the fight to expand/
contain slavery—to 1877—when the Republicans betrayed and ended Reconstruction
and withdrew troops from the South in exchange for the Hayes presidency.


42 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Similarly, the Confederate Army did not spring from thin air, but
evolved from what Du Bois called the “armed and commissioned camp
to keep Negroes in slavery and to kill the black rebel,” the proto-police
state the antebellum white South became after the Revolution.^4 Nor was
this armed camp destroyed utterly in the crucible of war and defeat, but
rather reformed itself as the white vigilantes and police forces (them-
selves often indistinguishable) of the following Reconstruction and Jim
Crow eras. The white industrialist North, labor and management alike,
had gone into the war not to abolish but to contain slavery (and thus
Black people) in the agrarian South, and it would continue afterward to
attempt to restrict Black movement and resist Black migration north and
westward.
White people north and south thus united after the war to main-
tain what theorist Saidiya Hartman calls the “tragic continuities in ante-
bellum and postbellum constitutions of blackness.”^5 These continuities
would mean—after a brief and often revolutionary interregnum known
as Reconstruction—such economic, social, and political oppression that
Frederick Douglass, in 1888, only eleven years after the end of Recon-
struction, would denounce emancipation as a “stupendous fraud.”*
Still, despite these bleak facts, the decades of the Civil War and the
self-emancipation of the enslaved are a crucial hinge point in American
history. The violent collapse of slavery dramatically accelerated a series
of economic and political transformations already under way: a market
driven by the rural production of agricultural staples giving way to one
driven by urban industrial outputs; political power shifting from south
to north and west, from planters and merchants to bankers and industri-
alists. The results of these changes would form the cornerstones of the
modern American state.
More important to our story and the possibility of revolution in Amer-
ica is the legal and ideological transformation of Black people from slaves

*As Saidiya Hartman asks: “How does one adequately render the double bind of eman-
cipation—that is, acknowledge the illusory freedom and travestied liberation that
succeeded chattel slavery without gainsaying the small triumphs of Jubilee?” (Saidiya

America [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997], 12).

into criminals, the formal transition of slave patrols into police, and the
increasing organization of Black people in America as a political, social,
and revolutionary force.
In the center of all these transformations is the fugitive slave. Winning
her emancipation singly, in groups and en masse, stealing through dark
swamps and across busy roads, dodging the slave catchers and outwitting
police patrols, she moves unseen on the edges of history, changing it
inexorably with her flight. To find herself, she must steal and abolish
white property, must abolish herself-as-property. She strikes fear into the
heart of white society because she reveals just how flimsy their regimes
of property, power, and domination can be in the face of her jailbreak for
freedom.
This specter of slaves freeing themselves is American history’s first
image of Black looters.

In describing the organized freeing of the enslaved as “loot-
ing” I am committing an anachronism. As we saw, loot does not appear
as an English word until 1845, and the word looter first appeared in 1858.
Nevertheless, it is easy to imagine that Nat Turner, John Brown, Har-
riet Tubman, and other revolutionaries—already referred to as robbers
and criminals—would have been called looters. For they were engaged
in nothing less than the open, organized, and criminal expropriation of
white property.
The enslaved themselves, more than their putative masters, even de-
scribed what they did as stealing. As Saidiya Hartman writes: “When the
enslaved slipped away to have secret meetings, they would call it ‘steal-
ing the meeting,’ as if to highlight the appropriation of space and the
expropriation of the object of property necessary to make these meetings
possible. Just as runaway slaves were described as ‘stealing themselves,’ so,
too, even short-lived ‘flights’ from captivity were referred to as ‘stealing
away.’”^6
As Hartman analyzes, even “small” acts of liberty and pleasure, such
as going to a prayer meeting, a dance, or visits with families and lovers,


44 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

were understood as having to be stolen. This produces a helpful and lib-
erating contradiction, for “property can’t steal property.” In looting them-
selves and in “stealing away,” the enslaved not only abolished themselves
as property but also pointed to the absurd paradox implicit in property it-
self. The act, Hartman notes, challenges and threatens the entire regime;
it “reconsiders the meaning of property, theft, and agency.”^7
However, much like a single riot or a single instance of looting does
not in itself endanger the system of property, a single fugitive did not in
herself threaten the total system of slavery. Robin Blackburn argues that
“to run away . . . could still impose a cost, but a very unequal one. The
owner lost the value of the slave but was rid of a problem.”^8 Of course,
the power of the owner is crucial. A CVS store is certain to be riot-insured
and operating with a huge margin, whereas a struggling business might
not be able to afford an extended closure and thus could be ruined by
a riot; similarly, a large plantation owner might be okay with seeing his
most rebellious property away, whereas a small white farmer who en-
slaved only one or two people might be ruined. And though individual
enslavers might do whatever they could to recapture a fugitive, some of
them understood that, as a class, owners benefited from the way escapees
functioned to relieve pressure within the plantation. Individual instances
of rioting and looting can similarly have a medium-term positive effect
for the regime of racial capitalism if they are not soon repeated or taken
further, instead functioning as “safety valves,” diffusing anger and releas-
ing tension. But this benefit is utterly lost in the long sweep of history.
Just as riots and uprisings produce a new generation of revolution-
aries, so too did the fugitives provide the basis for the abolition movement
of the antebellum period. As W. E. B. Du Bois writes in Black Reconstruc-
tion: “Not only was the fugitive slave important because of the actual loss
involved, but for potentialities in the future. These free Negroes were
furnishing a leadership for the mass of the black workers, and especially
they were furnishing a text for the abolition idealists. Fugitive slaves in-
creased the number of abolitionists by thousands and spelled the doom
of slavery.”^9
This doom was finally brought upon the South at the height of the
Civil War. From 1861 to 1865, five hundred thousand slaves escaped the


```
Looting Emancipation 45
```
plantations, throwing down tools and often crossing Union lines to eman-
cipation. As many as two hundred thousand of them served in the Union
Army. It is this incredible act of revolution that would both decide the
war and give it its meaning.^10 Du Bois called this movement the general
strike of the slaves.
This tremendous political action, this general strike, this mass loot-
ing did not appear from nothing or materialize “opportunistically” in the
face of war. Indeed, by 1860, before the general strike began, the number
of escapes had reached perhaps fifty thousand annually—many of those
escapees staying in maroon or free Black communities in the South and
some escaping for only a short time—meaning the general strike was
an acceleration and intensification of a movement already in process.^11
The number of fugitives steadily grew from 1830 onward, with a marked
increase in militancy after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.*
Fugitives played a crucial role in the end of slavery well before
their great revolutionary moment. In the face of the movement of ever-
increasing maroonage, the Democratic Party pushed the Fugitive Slave
Act into the Compromise of 1850: this law was a central component of
the political crisis that led to the outbreak of the Civil War. The act not
only made harboring a fugitive in a Free State a federal crime, not only
gave slave catchers jurisdiction over the entire North, not only removed
any legal proceedings beyond the enslaver’s testimony, but also obliged
all citizens to actively participate in capturing fugitives.
This law didn’t stem the tide of fugitives, but it did galvanize the abo-
lition movement, which grew increasingly militant in the face of the law’s
overreach: across the North, former slaves and free people armed them-
selves and started speaking not just of abolition but of revolution. And it
convinced many Northern white politicians, intellectuals, and capitalists
of the fearful rise of the great “Slave Power,” an anxiety not about slavery
itself but about a lack of Northern political sovereignty within the federal
government. This fear helped lead to the rise of the Republican Party and
the political crisis that would become secession.

*Recognizing the role of the enslaved in their own emancipation is one reason to join
Du Bois in seeing the Civil War as beginning in the partisan combat of Bloody Kansas
in 1854.


46 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

And so the fugitive, finding her emancipation by escaping the planta-
tion, pulled the tides of history toward emancipation for all.

Fugitives on the eve of the Civil War were drawing on a tra-
dition of revolt and resistance that was hundreds of years old. Across
the Americas, throughout the centuries, the sleep of white plantation
owners, merchants, and governors was made fitful by the nightmare of
slave revolt. The enslaved, armed with guns, hoes and scythes, flaming
torches and unimpeachable vengeance, marched unceasingly across
their unconscious. As the years progressed, these dreams took on a less
spectral and more nameable shape: Toussaint L’Ouverture, Jean-Jacques
Dessalines, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, Gabriel, Haiti, Bahia, Stono,
Amistad.
Violent insurrections were only the most spectacular form of re-
sistance. Poisoning enslavers, their kin, and their livestock, sabotaging
equipment, and burning buildings to the ground were common night
terrors of the enslaver. Suicide was also a common, tragic form of strug-
gle against the slave regime. Less dramatic, more everyday resistances
abounded. Working slowly and inexpertly, pretending ignorance or in-
comprehension—despite the widespread use of the hoe in African ag-
riculture—oversleeping, and other ways of rejecting the enslaver’s labor
regime and lowering his profits were practiced wherever Africans were
enslaved.^12
The most reliable form of resistance was flight. The very first known
enslaved Africans in what would become the United States, kidnapped
and brought to a small Spanish colony in the area of the Carolinas
around 1526, revolted, escaped their bondage, and lived out their lives
among Indigenous tribes.^13 Flight was not always permanent: the record
is full of the enslaved leaving only to visit family members and friends
on nearby plantations, to attend social events and religious gatherings, or
sometimes to strike, refusing to return to the plantation until demands
were met.^14


```
Looting Emancipation 47
```
In the early colonial days of what would become the United States,
those who escaped permanently fled to Indigenous tribes to the uncol-
onized west or to the sparsely colonized Spanish territory of Florida to
the south.* These fugitives also formed or joined secretive communi-
ties of escaped slaves in the swamps and hills around the plantations—
maroon communities. Although maroonage is a more historiographically
centered phenomenon in Brazil, Suriname, and the West Indies—for
example, in Jamaica, where maroon communities fought famous gue-
rilla wars with the colonizers—it was still considerably practiced in the
United States.
During the colonial period, European, African, and Indigenous en-
slaved and indentured peoples escaped the plantation together to form
maroon communities, with European maroons conveniently able to pass
as legal citizens and thus trade with the colonies on behalf of the larger
settlement.^15 Particularly large communities formed in the mid-Atlantic
Great Dismal Swamp and across more sparsely colonized Florida.
The maybe six-thousand-square-mile Great Dismal Swamp, running
through the borderlands of North Carolina and Virginia, was a known
free and hostile community in the center of slavery’s heartland. Maroons
from the Dismal Swamp sent units to serve alongside the British in the
Revolutionary War, and during “peacetime” they went on looting raids
out into the surrounding slave country, stealing supplies and freeing the
enslaved. In doing so, they developed guerilla tactics that would help
them to free thousands during the Civil War.
In Florida, between 1817 and 1858, the federal government waged
four decades of war to uproot the powerful autonomous Seminole com-
munities, made up of African maroons and Creek Indians. These com-
munities often sent looting raids into Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia to
free family members and comrades, and their settlements were the desti-
nation of many fugitives from the Deep South. Remembered in history as
the Seminole Wars, the federal government’s military campaigns against

them, which lasted for almost the entire antebellum period, started as
slave-catching expeditions.
The so-called Second Seminole War, from 1835 to 1842, included the
largest slave rebellion in American history outside of the Revolutionary
and Civil Wars. The role of maroons in this war has been mostly left out
of standard histories, but at least four hundred enslaved people looted
themselves from Florida plantations to join the Seminoles in fighting the
US government. A government terrified by Indigenous and Black solidar-
ity waged the Seminole Wars, and these conflicts represent an important
moment in the long tradition of armed self-defense in both insurgent
communities. It is a tradition that liberal historians often try to explain
away, but armed self-defense against the white supremacist state has al-
ways been a crucial part of movements for liberation.
Despite some victories, these protracted wars, at great cost to the US
government in lives and money, eventually saw most of the Seminoles
killed or forced to migrate to Oklahoma, Texas, or Mexico. Though
the Seminoles were never fully defeated, these campaigns, along with
the concomitant growth of plantations and white populations in US-
American Florida, meant that as the nineteenth century wore on Florida
became a less viable destination for fugitives. So, instead, many captives
stole themselves North.^16

Thanks to the centering of the Civil War in our study of the
history of slavery, and the telling of that history predominantly by the
liberal white descendants of the Union—who like to pretend that white
supremacy is a Southern condition—slavery is often wiped from the his-
tory of the Northern colonies. But Black and Indigenous captives of the
Dutch built the first European settlements on the island of Manhattan;*
Rhode Island was home to the two largest and most important colonial

the West Village to Herald Square, as freedom dues to their African captives. But after

slave markets of the eighteenth century; and people were auctioned on
the market squares and advertised in the newspapers of Philadelphia,
New York City, and Boston.
The North’s rocky soil and cold climate could not support large-
scale cash-crop plantation agriculture—though something resembling it
emerged in the fertile coastal areas of Rhode Island—so the Northern
colonies never had nearly the same numbers of enslaved Africans living
within them as did the South. But they still had slaves. And, as we’ve
seen, the famous small farmer and independent merchant of New En-
gland, central to the story of the American Revolution, did most of his
business with the slave colonies of the West Indies: New England often
replaced Britain as the third point in the Triangle Trade.
The North did not abolish slavery out of some liberality of spirit. In-
stead, it saw slavery mostly materially destroyed by fugitives in the years of
the American Revolution. Early in the war, the British promised emanci-
pation to any slaves who joined their cause. Eventually, seeing the incred-
ible effectiveness of this promise, so did colonial forces. Wherever the
war went, the enslaved escaped behind its lines. But, as Russell Maroon
Shoatz writes, though liberal historians “are fond of reminding every-
one that Blacks provided over five thousand fighters to the colonist cause
during that struggle,” the enslaved favored the British, joining with them
over the colonials at a rate of more than ten to one. At the war’s end, some
ten thousand Black people fled the colonies with the defeated army they
had fought alongside, leaving the new United States on British ships.^17
This does not mean that the British, still reaping massive profits from
the slave trade and enslaving hundreds of thousands across their empire,
had suddenly become the friends of the enslaved: the Crown’s forces
were merely the simplest and easiest vehicle of emancipation. Those who
joined neither army fled otherwise. Tens of thousands used the confusion
to flee to Indigenous and maroon communities, if not to Florida, then
to Canada. Perhaps one hundred thousand, or 20 percent of the entire

ership. “Manhattan was thus twice stolen from oppressed peoples” (J. Sakai, Settlers
[Chicago: Morningstar Press, 1989], 8).

colonial enslaved population, escaped during the conflict. And because
much of the fighting happened in the North, a much higher percentage
of the enslaved in New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylva-
nia, though a smaller absolute number, made it to freedom.
Northern slavery, thus considerably reduced from its relatively small
position, was legally abolished in the years following the Revolution, with
the last state to formally do so New Jersey in 1804. And yet, even this eco-
nomically safe, mostly after-the-fact legal abolition was not carried out
immediately and totally but was rather instituted gradually and partially
by state governments. The law that abolished slavery in New York, passed
in 1799, protected enslavers such that slavery only actually ended in the
state in 1827. There were still hundreds of legal slaves in Pennsylvania
and New Jersey in the 1840s.
And as African slavery began to disappear from Northern states, white
people installed laws and practices discouraging free Black people from
settling there that, to the modern eye, look an awful lot like Jim Crow.
These included disenfranchising Black men, banning them from pro-
fessional trades, and instituting harsher criminal sentencing for Black
people. All this happened against the backdrop of extensive vigilante
white violence. Frederick Douglass, escaping bondage and settling as a
free man in New Bedford, Massachusetts, was barred from practicing
his highly skilled trade of caulking. Despite the flourishing shipbuilding
business in this major whaling port, Douglass was forced into low-waged
general laboring. And New Bedford was an abolitionist stronghold! As a
result of these proto–Jim Crow practices, despite the fact that many ma-
roons would come to settle in the North, they were greatly outnumbered
by white American birthrates and European settlers, and the percentage
of the Northern population that was Black decreased by more than half
between the signing of the Constitution in 1787 and the forming of the
Confederacy in 1861.
At the same time, the enslaved population in the South grew expo-
nentially, particularly after the introduction of the cotton gin and the
resultant cotton boom of the early nineteenth century. With the expan-
sion of slavery to the south and west, as America colonized Florida, the

Louisiana Territories, and Texas, fugitive routes to freedom increasingly
pointed north.

Much as popular histories of the Black liberation movement
of the 1960s often reduce it to MLK’s dream, Rosa Parks, sit-ins, and Free-
dom Rides, the general sense of the antebellum abolition movement is as
a largely white protest movement that mostly worked to change the hearts
and minds of Northerners. It’s true that propaganda campaigns, slave nar-
ratives, public rallies, and Northern organizing were crucial parts of the
movement. But in the years leading up to the Civil War, it was a move-
ment equally focused on militant direct action, whether through opposi-
tion to the fugitive slave laws or by the Underground Railroad.^18
The Underground Railroad was equally not some group of friendly
white Quaker homeowners who helped fugitives by hiding them in their
extra rooms. Though such people existed, they were a minority of the
decentralized network of militants, many of them fugitives themselves,
most of them Black, who would come to be described by the umbrella
term Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad was extensive
in the North, but it also led into Mexico, a western branch aided and
organized in large part by Indigenous tribes and displaced Seminole ma-
roons. This route became less viable, however, after the Compromise of
1850 made Texas an official slave state.
Lacking any overarching organization, illegal from the very outset,
from the early nineteenth century until the Civil War, the Railroad laid
its track all across the country. This widespread, horizontal group of free-
dom fighters was not a formal party or organization but, as historian Eric
Foner describes it, an “interlocking series of local networks.”^19 The Un-
derground Railroad is believed to have helped as many as one hundred
thousand fugitives to freedom in the North, with thousands more escap-
ing to Mexico.
Underground Railroad stations stood as waypoints in a series of logis-
tically and geographically distinct routes to freedom. The first station a

fugitive might encounter, if they fled slavery by foot, was a home at bor-
der points between slave and free territory, such as on the northern banks
of the Ohio River, where fugitives could hide out and wait for passage
farther north.
Their next stop might be facilitated by an urban “vigilance commit-
tee.” Vigilance committees were among the most important stations on
the railroad and were set up as major hubs in cities such as Boston, New
York, Oberlin, and Philadelphia. These small, local action committees
sometimes comprised only a handful of people and were in constant
need of funds. Nevertheless, their records furnish much of the surviving
documentary history of the Underground Railroad. When things went
easily, committee members would receive word from stations farther
south or west and greet arriving fugitives as soon as they landed. But
they also scoured the neighborhoods around ports and train stations for
apparent fugitives who had managed to gain access to transport out of the
South and who had arrived alone or without a plan.
Upon arriving in a free town or city, many fugitives described asking
for help from the first Black person they saw, who often directed them to
the vigilance committee or a local station of the Railroad. Though the re-
cords are obviously biased toward those who successfully found the com-
mittees, evidence still points to the fact that this knowledge was widely
spread in free Black communities. Urban Black communities practiced
mutual aid, protection, and self-defense: abolitionist action was not only
taken by those who considered themselves activists.
The committees gave the fugitive shelter and food, investigated
whether they were being hunted, and organized legal counsel if needed.
They set up fugitives with work and housing locally if it was safe and
the fugitive wanted to remain, or they bought them rail tickets or ship
passage farther north. Fugitives frequently went on to Canada or to cit-
ies with a strong abolitionist community—such as New Bedford, where
Frederick Douglass settled—which meant they would be better protected
from slave catchers. When they arrived, they were then helped by activ-
ists who organized work and housing for them and often reunited them
with family or friends who may have been expecting them.


```

```
But vigilance committees didn’t just protect the newly emancipated.
The fugitive slave act of 1793 gave enslavers and their inheritors the per-
manent power to capture fugitives, no matter how long the fugitive had
been free. And because the evidence required was minimal (and even
this tiny legal hurdle was cleared by the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, un-
der which law, as historian Nell Irvin Painter writes, “a slaveholder need
merely swear that a particular black person was his slave, and appointed
commissioners and federal marshals would seize the purported fugi-
tive”^20 ), Black people born free were frequently kidnapped under this law
and sent into slavery.
Vigilance committees would thus track the marshals and courts
closely. With only nineteenth-century communication technologies,
they had to mobilize quickly, because the legal proceedings to send a
“fugitive” South often lasted less than twenty-four hours from the mo-
ment the person was kidnapped by slave catchers—American courts
can work quickly when that speed serves white supremacy. Even so,
the committees often prevailed upon lawyers to delay proceedings long
enough for the kidnapped person to escape to freedom, and sometimes
crowds gathered and physically attempted to free them from marshals
and enslavers. These slave-freeing riots, these lootings, though they
didn’t always succeed, happened frequently enough in Manhattan
to be a major impetus in the creation of the New York City Police
Department.^21
This entire “railroad journey” was done with great speed, seriousness,
and secrecy and under the constant threat of danger and violence. When
it went smoothly, it appeared a simple logistical procedure, but assisting
fugitives was a federal crime and Underground Railroad militants were
the declared enemies of the enslavers and the state. Many were jailed,
(re)enslaved, or killed.
No role in the Underground Railroad was more dangerous than that
of “conductor,” however. Many of those souls who organized raids into
the hearts of slave country itself, free men and women who led military
incursions into hostile territory to help free the enslaved, never came
back. And no conductor is so widely known as Harriet Tubman.


54 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Tubman was recognized as a great leader, referred to by the enslaved
and free alike as “Moses,” an important and powerful designation in a
time and among a population, as many have noted, that thought quite lit-
erally and directly in biblical references. But even during her life, white
supporters described Tubman as “superhuman,” as somehow fundamen-
tally different from other ex-slaves. As biographer Butch Lee writes, “This
made her less dangerous to them. Easier to handle. Less awesome. After
all, picture a nation of Harriet Tubmans.”^22
Indeed, just as bourgeois history uses the most visible and famous
movement leaders to obscure the great masses who make their leadership
possible and legible, so does Harriet Tubman’s heightened visibility serve
to hide the thousands of operatives who ventured into slave territory every
year to free slaves. As J. Sakai writes: “In 1860 we know that five hundred
underground organizers went into the South from Canada alone.”^23
Harriet Tubman was only the most famous of a generation of militant
warriors who fought for the total overturning of slavery by any means
necessary. She lived a life of direct action. Born into slavery, Tubman
never learned to read, but she became a brilliant military tactician. She
planned and carried out nineteen separate raids into slave territory, usu-
ally going twice a year, often on foot, without ever being caught: one of
her major strategic insights was to continue moving south some distance
with the newly fugitive before heading north, because enslavers never
suspected groups would head deeper into slave territory. Tubman bore
a massive bounty on her head until the fall of slavery; she was the most
wanted, and hated, woman in the South.
Tubman falling ill delayed John Brown—who called her “General
Tubman”—from attempting to loot the armory at Harpers Ferry on the
planned date of July 4, 1859. Had she been present when Brown carried
out their plan on October 16, 1859, some have argued, she would have
prevented Brown from making the tactical blunders—most notably, al-
lowing a mail train to leave Harpers Ferry and thus bring news of the
raid to the federal government—that led to his becoming a martyr and
symbol rather than a victorious freedom fighter. And had Tubman and
Brown’s raid succeeded, the terms of the Civil War might not have been

```
set by the slavocracy’s secession but rather by a revolutionary slave army,
as Terry Bisson imagines in his speculative historical novel Fire on the
Mountain. But, much as the enslaved have been removed from the nar-
rative of their own liberation, Tubman is erased from or made a footnote
in the popular history of John Brown’s raid.*
So, too, is her role, and the role of the enslaved in general, during the
combat of the Civil War. Tubman is known as a spy for the Union Army,
but again this is individualized and taken out of context. She is seen as “a
lone superwoman spy for the white man’s army,” when instead she orga-
nized an intelligence network of river pilots, Black scouts, and slaves that
kept the Union Army informed of enemy movements. Indeed, the impor-
tance to the Union effort of maroon intelligence and knowledge, both of
local terrain and Confederate movements, cannot be overemphasized.
And Tubman’s most dramatic military action, the Combahee River
raid, is sometimes left out of popular histories altogether. In June 1863,
during the height of Civil War combat, Tubman guided three hundred
Black soldiers up the Combahee River in the middle of the night, deep
into South Carolina plantation country. As a reporter’s dispatch at the
time described it, they “struck a bold and effective blow, destroying mil-
lions of dollars worth of commissary stores, cotton and lordly dwellings,
and striking terror into the heart of rebeldom, brought off near 800 slaves
and thousands of dollars worth of property, without losing a man or re-
ceiving a scratch.”^24
They set fire to four plantations and six mills and looted property and
slaves from wealthy Confederates. Such an act, within the context of war,
was celebrated by white supporters of the Union Army. But had it been
carried out under “peaceful” circumstances, would it have been cele-
brated or seen as an act of violent looting, rioting, arson, and rebellion?
The reaction to John Brown’s failed raid, only four years earlier, gives
us our answer: the US Senate set up a committee to prosecute anyone
who had aided Brown, Abraham Lincoln called him “insane,” and many

*It’s not just Tubman: when I visited the John Brown museum in Harpers Ferry in July
2015, the exhibit about the Black men who fought beside him during the raid was rele-

liberal white abolitionists reacted with shock and outrage against his vio-
lent methods.
It is only the 20/20 hindsight of history—a vision corrected by the ac-
tions of the enslaved—that allows us to see property in human beings as
the evil it was. At the time, it was as natural as the prisons and police are
today. Only the thousands of abolitionists like Tubman, the millions of
enslaved who rose up in revolt, flight, and strike and who overthrew the
system of slavery, have allowed us to see slavery clearly.

When the soon-to-be Confederate states withdrew from the
Union, starting with South Carolina on December 20, 1860, they did so
ostensibly in response to the election of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln was
the presidential candidate of the six-year-old Republican Party, which
had formed out of the ashes of a number of political parties—the Whigs,
the Know-Nothings, and the northern half of the Democrats—all of
whose national bases had fractured during the 1850s over the question
of slavery.^25 But the Southern states that rose in reactionary secession
against the United States did not do so because Lincoln threatened to
end slavery but because he intended to keep it from spreading into the
new territories of the American West.
The general strike of the enslaved meant that the Civil War would
become a struggle over the existence of slavery, but, up until their great
revolt, the total and immediate abolition of slavery was an extreme and
unpopular political vision. Beyond the enslaved themselves, it was held
mostly by freeborn Black people, ex-slaves, maroons, and a tiny handful
of radical whites who had joined the abolitionist movement. The main-
stream political battles over slavery in the 1850s were rather between the
plantation class, who wanted slavery to expand into the territories of the
West, and those who wanted the western territories to join the Union as
“Free Soil.”
The plantation owners, with pretensions of being European gentle-
men, believed they were creating a New World historical slave empire

and cultural center akin to Rome or Greece. To prove this, they spent
money well beyond their means, imagining elaborate displays of conspic-
uous consumption and architectural splendor made them akin to Euro-
pean aristocrats. The massive, chronic debt thus accumulated—perhaps
the main attribute they really shared with nineteenth-century European
nobility—combined with increasing market pressures, meant that they
needed to expand available plantation territory to increase their profits.
They looked hungrily toward Mexico (which then included much of to-
day’s southwestern United States), California, and the Caribbean, where
they saw the promise of endless plantations filled with African laborers.
They rejected the Northern model of development, believing that the
industrialist production of a professional middle class would mean less
wealth accumulation at the top and that, furthermore, reliance on a mas-
sive white proletariat promised class war from the bottom.
The Free Soil movement, for its part, represented a cross-class alli-
ance that, though it included abolitionists, was mostly made up of North-
ern capitalists, merchants, recent European immigrants, and organized
labor. Capitalists looked to Haiti with horror and believed that it was slav-
ery that produced unmanageably rebellious subjects. Some of America’s
first Nimbyists, they wanted to keep profiting off of plantation slavery as it
existed, restrained to the South, but to use the “new” territory for mixed
agricultural and industrial development carried out by a predominantly
immigrant white settler workforce. The workers, who wanted to settle the
land as homesteaders, joined them in this white supremacist vision: the
expansion of slave plantations across the territory would leave no space
for them to homestead.* Furthermore, just like racist anti-immigrant
rhetoric holds today, many white workers and organized labor unions of
the antebellum period believed that the mere presence of Black workers,
enslaved or free, drove down wages.

*They did not foresee that Free Soil would betray them all the same and that the best
land would be consolidated overwhelmingly by railroads and various corporations, leav-
ing poor soil and hardscrabble lives for the homesteaders, who would by debt and ma-
nipulation largely be transformed into tenant farmers in the decades following the Civil
War.

Neither side saw any problem with the fact that these territories
were to be added to the United States by the violent conquest of their
Indigenous residents, many of them already multiply displaced by
America’s genocidal expansion. The political conflict around slavery
that precipitated the Civil War was, in other words, between two differ-
ent white supremacist, pro-slavery, settler-colonialist visions of Amer-
ica’s future.
Throughout this period, all branches of the federal government re-
mained steadfastly pro-slavery. Congress passed the series of bills making
up the Compromise of 1850, which, along with enacting the Fugitive
Slave Act, guaranteed that slave states would retain their disproportion-
ate power in the federal government. That compromise was the dip-
lomatic coup of the moderate liberal president Millard Fillmore, but
such mealy-mouthed liberal white supremacy would give way, in 1853,
to a fiercely pro-slavery executive branch led by Democratic president
Franklin Pierce. Pierce shepherded the disastrous Kansas-Nebraska Act
through Congress, an act that would overturn federal restrictions on
slavery’s expansion and lead to the first stage of the Civil War, when
guerilla combat between enslavers and abolitionists exploded in Kansas.
Not to be outdone by the other branches of government, the Supreme
Court in 1857 issued the Dred Scott decision, which ruled that Black
people had never been allowed to be nor ever could be American cit-
izens, that Congress was constitutionally unable to ban slavery in the
territories, and that the federal government had no legal ground to free
slaves whatsoever.
But this strong governmental support for slavery, driven by South-
ern Democrats, wasn’t enough for the constantly anxious plantation
class, who feared that the actual unification of Free Soilers within a
single political party—the Republicans—threatened their goals and
their future power in Washington. Still, Lincoln’s election was more
pretense than cause. Tubman and Brown’s insurrection had flared
up only a year previously, in October 1859, and, combined with the
constantly growing movement of fugitives—reaching fifty thousand
maroons per annum by 1860—and the always increasing “disorder”

among urban communities of enslaved Black workers, insurgency
seemed a much more immediate threat to slavery’s existence than
Abraham Lincoln. The planters believed they would be better armed
legally and normatively to repress slave uprisings if they didn’t have to
confer with a North that just didn’t understand the necessities of their
peculiar institution.
Slavery was simultaneously more successful than it had ever been—
the cotton crop of 1859 was almost twice the size of that of 1850—and
facing more organized and concerted limits than ever before. Southern
plantation owners believed they would not be able to compete politically
or economically forever without the expansion of slavery’s territory, and
they believed that this was a fortuitous moment to force the issue. Arro-
gant in the face of their legislative successes, the planters overestimated
their power and their popular support. And so the enslavers made their
great historical gambit, counterrevolution by secession, and sealed their
fate as a doomed class.^26

When the slave states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Flor-
ida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas seceded from the United
States and formed their own federal government, the Confederacy, in
the winter of 1860, they did so under the banner of states’ rights, with the
aim of protecting and expanding slavery.* They hoped that their seces-
sion would be recognized by the North and that they would be allowed
to split away.
The Confederate leadership’s reasoning wasn’t totally wrong-headed.
They anticipated that Lincoln and the North quite possibly might accept
a peaceful secession. And, in case of war, they felt confident in the gal-
lantry of Southern gentlemen and the support of the French and the En-
glish empire, an empire whose global domination was built in substantial

part on profits in textiles made from plantation cotton.* Much as the
North, they foresaw any martial conflict being short-lived and relatively
bloodless. Even when war broke out, they had no immediate reason to
fear the coming end of their system.
This is one of the most important interventions Du Bois’s Black Re-
construction makes: to clearly lay out that the Union did not intend to
free the slaves and that emancipation was against the Union’s economic,
political, and social interests. The abolitionists of the time knew this well.
As Frederick Douglass famously put it in a speech in 1865, the war was
begun “in the interests of slavery on both sides. The South was fighting
to take slavery out of the Union, and the North fighting to keep it in the
Union; the South fighting to get it beyond the limits of the United States
Constitution, and the North fighting for the old guarantees;—both de-
spising the Negro, both insulting the Negro.”^27
As Du Bois argues, not only could the North never have fielded an
army under the slogan “Abolition of the Slaves,” it did not want to. Nor
did Free Soil, the political argument unifying the Republican Party, make
any sense in justifying a war with the South, where there was, after all, no
new “Free Soil” to settle. “On the other hand, the tremendous economic
ideal of keeping this great market for goods, the United States, together
with all its possibilities of agriculture, manufacture, trade and profit, ap-

*This is one of the many ways that the Confederacy underestimated the power of the
people. When England did not immediately support the Southern cause, the planters
organized a boycott against selling cotton to England, which was then made moot by a
Union blockade of the southern coast. Though many planters continued selling their
cotton on the black market to the North, England, and Europe—as with all capitalists,
their patriotism ended abruptly at their pocketbooks—this sudden drop in supply result-
ing from the blockade meant the price of cotton exploded in England. The textile fac-
tory owners in northwest England cut back dramatically on textile production, sending
thousands of English workers into unemployment, an event referred to as the Lancashire
Cotton Famine.
But rather than give in to this blackmail on the part of both their bosses and the slav-
ocracy, in one of history’s great moments of international solidarity the working people of
northern England organized mutual aid to see themselves through the crisis— including
a series of riots that had them looting bread—held protests demanding their employers
and the English government remain steadfast against the Confederacy and slavery at any
cost, and sent declarations in support of emancipation to Lincoln. This unrest helped
keep the English out of the war until the Emancipation Proclamation, at which point
English entry on the side of the Confederacy became politically impossible.

pealed to both the West and the North; and what was then much more
significant, it appealed to the Border States.”^28
Lincoln, despite whatever tale liberal historians or Hollywood ha-
giographers want to tell, was no abolitionist. Had the war not broken
out and had his most ambitious antebellum emancipation proposal gone
into effect, he would have set slavery in America on a course to legally
end .  . . in a hundred years. In 1958. Furthermore, Lincoln believed
that the best course of abolition would be to “convince” Black people
to emigrate from the United States, a historical position called “coloni-
zation.” The same day that Lincoln finished drafting the Emancipation
Proclamation, December 31, 1862, he also signed a contract funding the
relocation of five thousand Black men, women, and children to Haiti as
an experimental test case for total colonization.^29 The experiment failed
miserably, but he was still arguing for colonization as late as 1864. And
even in 1865, with emancipation all but completed, Lincoln opposed
giving Black men the vote.
But the Civil War was that rare historical period—a revolution-
ary period—in which the desires and goals of the powerful are swept
aside utterly by the vision and action of the masses. Just as through their
self-emancipation the enslaved gave the Civil War its meaning, so it was
their belief that Lincoln would be the Great Emancipator that would
make him appear so to history.
Lincoln’s transformation was, ironically, aided by the most rabid
Southern ideologues. In both the 1860 presidential contest and in the
state-by-state campaigns for secession in the winter of 1860–1861, the
slavocracy’s propagandists painted Lincoln a dangerous enemy of the
peculiar institution. Though this was a provocation that Lincoln would
continuously deny, it had unexpected consequences. The political cam-
paign Southern nationalists waged to confer legitimacy on peaceful se-
cession, held in the big houses of the plantations and the central squares
of Southern cities, was based on the (false) claim that Lincoln’s election
would mean abolition, and the campaign couldn’t be waged without re-
vealing this logic to the enslaved. So when secession instead came with
war and chaos, not an orderly and peaceful legal split, the enslaved did
not see some grim tale of “brother fighting brother” but rather Jubilee,

the Bible-ordained day of emancipation, and they fled the plantation in
their hundreds of thousands.
But they didn’t go all at once. As Du Bois argues, a mass move-
ment among a largely illiterate, geographically dispersed, and isolated
population like that of the four million Africans enslaved in the United
States builds slowly and in fits and starts. And it was unclear at the outset
whether the Union Army was indeed an army of emancipation.
In 1861, as Union generals advanced into South Carolina and Vir-
ginia, they made assurances to the local owners that slavery would not be
threatened. Union general Ambrose Burnside returned fugitives to their
plantations, and many generals allowed civilian enslavers to enter their
lines and retrieve their “property.” Throughout the first years of the war,
the administration refused Black volunteers, and Lincoln was deliberat-
ing with his cabinet whether or not to attempt an army-wide return of all
fugitives. Even through 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation, the
Union Army was returning fugitives in the border states to their enslavers
(the proclamation had not freed border-state slaves anyway).*
But the enslaved kept striking. Fugitives arrived in the tens, in the
hundreds, some fully fit, many in terrible physical condition. What was
to be done? General Benjamin Butler hit upon a happy solution in Fort
Monroe in Virginia. When asked by enslavers to return three men who
had escaped to the fort, he refused, declaring the fugitives “contraband
of war” and putting them to work. As the war turned more serious, and as
the Union Army desperately needed labor, the soundness of this strategy
was recognized, and it was taken up for the year and a half of combat pre-
ceding the Emancipation Proclamation. The fact that the Union Army at

sion and thus remained part of the Union, although allegiances within the states were
split and some white men from there fought with the Confederacy. These are known as
the border states, and as a result of their presence the Union always contained slavery
within it.

cally: “The policy preserved the norms of slave property even as it opened
new possibilities to resist bondage.”^30
However, as soon as it became clear that the Union Army would ac-
cept fugitives, “the movement became a general strike against the slave
system on the part of all who could find opportunity. The trickling streams
of fugitives swelled to a flood.”^31 In many places, fugitives did the crucial
labor in the construction of Union Army infrastructure; elsewhere they
did equally important agricultural work, gathering the crops on aban-
doned plantations behind Union lines for the army to sell. Elsewhere,
many more refused to work for the Union as a condition of their liberty,
instead squatting and claiming land, setting up agricultural communes,
or joining maroon communities. Through their flight and strike, they
dramatically transformed conditions on both sides of the front lines.
The next logical step, literally unthinkable to both sides only a few
years previously, was to arm the fugitives and hire them to serve in the
Union Army, a measure that followed quickly on the heels of the Eman-
cipation Proclamation. Virulent racism in the Union meant Black peo-
ple were seen as unfit for service, but the Union was facing an enlistment
crisis.
By 1863, two years into the combat, both sides, despite instituting a
draft, confronted considerable problems recruiting soldiers. In the North,
the poor, largely immigrant populations that represented the majority of
Union conscripts resented serving in a bloody and seemingly intractable
war fought on behalf of industrialists. But this class resentment merged
with a resurgent Northern anti-Blackness, and Black people, rather than
the slavocracy, were blamed for the conflict.
The New York City Draft Riots, among the most violent riots in
American history, began as working-class, predominantly Irish men rose
up against the draft’s incredible class bias. The law allowed a man of
draft age to hire a substitute for $300 (more than $6,000 in 2020 dollars)
rather than serve, and as a result few rich men wore the Union blue.
But the riots turned into an anti-Black pogrom, killing over one hundred
Black people and burning down abolitionists’ homes, Black bars and the-
aters, and even the Colored Orphan Asylum. In the aftermath of the riots,


64 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

almost the entire Black population fled the city, many of them settling in
Brooklyn. Though they never reached such violent extremes elsewhere,
in 1863 antiwar riots spread and racist antiwar sentiment ran rampant in
the North.
But classed resentment of the war was even more pronounced in the
South. As Armstead L. Robinson argues in his seminal Bitter Fruits of
Bondage, the very fact that the war was being fought to preserve slavery
doomed the Confederacy’s cause from the outset. To show this, Robinson
traces the social composition of the Confederacy, whose class makeup
was oligarchic in the extreme. Out of the total population of the South—
around ten million people—four million were enslaved and six million
were free. But of those free families, only 25 percent enslaved Africans,
and, of that 25 percent, only 10 percent had enough land and human
property to qualify as “planters.” Yet, thanks to the Three-Fifths Compro-
mise, that tiny cohort of planters had voting power equivalent to perhaps
two million citizens in the North. A similar form of disenfranchisement
continues in 2020, as imprisoned people are stripped of their right to vote,
even though the census counts them as residents of the (overwhelmingly
rural, white) counties where they are caged rather than the (mostly Black,
urban) communities from which they are captured.
As Robinson shows, when the Confederacy seceded, despite mak-
ing paeans to states’ rights and individual sovereignty, the planter class
doubled down on their oligarchic power, with planters and their allies
taking almost every seat in the Confederate congress and cabinet. Con-
federate president Jefferson Davis was a plantation owner, as was Vice
President Alexander Stephens and General Robert E. Lee. Though the
vast majority of Confederate citizens were poor backcountry yeoman
farmers with no human property, many living very far away even from
plantation country, they had no representation in the Confederate gov-
ernment. The planters’ interest was the only interest truly represented in
Richmond, the seat of the Confederate government from May 29, 1861,
just after the war began, until April 3, 1865, when it fell to Union forces.
This meant that in session after session the Confederate government
passed draft exemptions for planters, overseers, and their families. Mean-


```

```
while, planters used their influence in local militias to keep corps of men
at home for defense against fugitives and slave rebellion. At the very mo-
ment the Confederate cause needed all able-bodied men on the front
lines, the planters schemed to increase the numbers of the slave patrols
on the home front instead.
The general strike of the enslaved made these patrollers’ presence on
each individual plantation even more necessary as, at the same time, it
made their efforts in aggregate totally fruitless. On plantations where work
continued, slowdowns and disorder increased dramatically. “Morale”
completely collapsed on many plantations, where the enslaved simply
stopped working, fled en masse, or even took control themselves. Much
was made in the Confederate press of the Black sexual menace threaten-
ing the wives and daughters of planters left alone during wartime, a cruel
and twisted propagandistic tool considering the centuries-long endemic
rape of African women by their enslavers. However, the record shows
remarkably little violence committed against planters or their families in
the period—Du Bois explains this by suggesting it was simply easier to
run away.
But even as plantation production began to break down, and with it
the economic backbone of the Confederacy, so too did soldier morale.
Hardly the popular cause its white supremacist defenders today like to
pretend, after an early burst of excitement in 1861, the yeomen of the
South began to see the Confederate struggle for what it was: “a rich man’s
war and a poor man’s fight.” Though this phrase describes most of the
wars ever fought in history, as Robinson shows, in the South this partic-
ular slogan was widespread and had devastating consequences. Entire
Confederate companies melted away to desertion. In some places, dis-
sident white yeomen assisted fugitives and spread intelligence about the
war, serving as Union spies alongside enslaved people. In other regions,
like the highlands of Eastern Tennessee, poor white Unionists resisted
the Confederacy with guerilla warfare, opening up internal fronts that
spread Confederate military forces thin. However, it is important not to
confuse our current understanding of the Civil War with the motives of
all who fought against the Confederacy: although some of these yeomen


66 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

were abolitionist, many of these Unionist forces were just as racist as their
Confederate enemies. Nevertheless, they played a crucial role in bogging
down the Confederacy and destroying its power.
Thus, a war fought to preserve slavery produced the conditions under
which the enslaved could escape and destroy it. In attempting to stop
this social upheaval and preserve the slave system, Confederate policy
exacerbated class tensions, guaranteeing the Confederacy couldn’t win
the military struggle, either.* By the time Black fugitives finally put on
the Union blue, the war was as good as over for the Confederacy. As
the Union ranks swelled with the two hundred thousand fugitives ready
to take up arms against their former enslavers, the Confederate lines
thinned, the plantations failed, and the planter class perished in a storm
of fire and blood.

The Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 arises as a crucial mo-
ment in the Union winning the war. The fact that the war was then being
framed as a fight against slavery made it politically impossible for Euro-
pean capitalists to recognize the Confederacy as a sovereign nation and
support it in combat. Just as importantly, it opened up the Union Army
ranks to Black soldiers and convinced Black people that the Union was a
cause worth fighting for.
The Emancipation Proclamation did nothing to free the enslaved. It
only declared slavery ended in the Confederacy, where the federal gov-
ernment had no actual power to enforce it, in effect only freeing those
who had already freed themselves. Slavery was maintained in the border
states of the Union, the states where Lincoln actually had the power to

*The romantic historical fictions of latter-day Confederate apologists and Union fan-
tasists that see the war being won or lost by a brave stand on a little hill in Gettysburg,
for example, or that imagine a better-organized Confederate attack winning the war are
structurally racist fantasies that focus solely on the military context. But wars are social
and political events, not merely armies meeting in combat, and much as the Russian
army in World War I was defeated not by the Imperial German Army but by revolution
at home, so the Confederacy was defeated not by the Union Army but by the revolution
of the Black people it enslaved, who used the Union as their tool of liberation.

enforce emancipation. The proclamation affirmed and perhaps encour-
aged the general strike, but, as Lerone Bennett Jr. records:

```
Secretary of State William H. Seward, who heaped scorn on the
Emancipation Proclamation, [told] his friend Donn Piatt that “we
have let off a puff of wind over an accomplished fact.”
“What do you mean, Mr. Seward?” Piatt asked.
“I mean,” he said, “that the Emancipation Proclamation was ut-
tered in the first gun fired at Fort Sumter, and we have been the last
to hear it.”^32
```
Lincoln did not want to be an emancipator, but the enslaved un-
derstood what his war meant, and they surged forward to freedom any-
way. Lincoln—that rarest of things, an intelligent politician—still spent
nearly two years in denial before recognizing the enslaved were the key
to Union victory and changing war policy to reflect it. But the enslaved
moved his hand. Theirs was the glory of the Jubilee, theirs the defeat of
the Confederacy, theirs the collapse of the planters and the building of
Reconstruction.
The general strike of the slaves was but one of the largest culmina-
tions in the long and continuing history of fugitive attacks on property
and white supremacy in America. Indeed, “nowhere in history had so
large a revolutionary seizure of property taken place.”^33 When the British
abolished slavery in the West Indies in 1833 (it remained legal in India),
the Crown compensated all the enslavers for the value of their chattel,
cash that constituted the seed money for many modern British corpora-
tions. But the Confederate planters received no such bailout. The value
of human property in 1860 was $3 billion, which was equivalent to about
two-thirds of the GDP. An equivalent percentage of the GDP today
would be about $14 trillion. All of it abolished in the span of four years.
To get free, the enslaved had to steal themselves and, in so doing,
abolish themselves as property. They had to loot themselves, entering a
lawless relation to property and the state. The relationship between lib-
eration and the stealing and destruction of property was never so obvious
nor so clear cut as it was during the period.


68 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

An entire class of people, the planters, who had reigned aristocratic
for two hundred years, was suddenly destroyed, submerged entirely into
the general population. When Du Bois wrote Black Reconstruction in
1935, he was contesting a narrative by wealthy white Southerners and Ku
Klux Klanners that they were the noble descendants of the slavocracy.
But as he made clear:

```
Of the names of prominent Southern families in Congress in 1860,
only two appear in 1870, five in 1880. Of 90 prominent names in 1870,
only four survived in 1880. Men talk today as though the upper class
in the white South is descended from the slave-holders; yet we know
by plain mathematics that the ancestors of most of the present South-
erners never owned a slave nor had any real economic part in slavery.
The disaster of war decimated the planters; the bitter disappointment
and frustration led to a tremendous mortality after the war, and from
1870 on the planter class merged their blood so completely with the
rising poor whites that they disappeared as a separate aristocracy.^34
```
The fugitives and the ex-slaves, impoverished, illiterate, faced their
freedom in a war-torn country that resented their very existence and tried
to make a good life for themselves. As Frederick Douglass remarked at
the time: “The work does not end with the abolition of slavery, but only
begins.” They built schools, hospitals, and cooperatives, organized mu-
tual aid societies and democratic ordinances, petitioned the federal gov-
ernment for land and autonomy or simply took it for themselves: this is
the period called Reconstruction. In the 1660s, they would have been
able to make a claim for freedom dues for their servitude, but in 1865, as
in 2020, they and their descendants were scorned for demanding repara-
tions. Yet still they tried to build a better world on the salted grounds of
slavery.
And even as the Southern planter class collapsed, ex-Confederates
held onto their racial power through campaigns of vigilante terror, and
Northern capitalists swooped in to win the spoils of war. The railroad
men and the mine owners, the bankers, speculators, and merchants, the
senators, governors, and judges watched the planters drown and vowed


```
Looting Emancipation 69
```
not to let it happen to themselves. They ensured that their property could
not be so easily looted; neither would they ever allow its destruction to
gain the moral righteousness and historical clarity of the struggle for
emancipation.
The revolution was begun, but not completed, and, as all partial rev-
olutions, it would eventually sink back down under a morass of repres-
sion, violence, and confusion, waiting for a future generation to lift it up
out of the muck, study its tactics, its promises, and its visions, and finally
complete the dream of Jubilee.

W
ithout the planters and the Confederacy, without a huge
class of enslaved people, how could the Southern economy, based
on brutally exploitative agricultural labor, regain its footing after the war?
How could the economy be rebuilt? Would it be? Though Northern cap-
italists had just financed a war that destroyed the slave system, they had
no intention of truly developing or even transforming the South: the ag-
ricultural products produced by Black labor were essential for their prof-
its, and they wanted the South to continue to contribute cheap cotton,
tobacco, and other staple commodities.
But the formerly enslaved had no intention of returning to the bond-
age they had just destroyed. How could the country re-create the agri-
cultural base its profits so relied on without being able to re-create the
slave power that had been so thoroughly discredited and destroyed, and
without being willing to empower the newly freed and organized Black
communities, who had no intention of simply providing cheap labor? It
was going to require politics, and it was going to require violence.
In that task, they found willing accomplices in the white Southern
Democrats, who had just come through the humiliation of total defeat
and were wanting revenge. Ex-Confederates formed gangs of vigilante


72 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

terrorists, and police forces that had developed in the urban centers of
the South were reinforced and re-empowered. The ad hoc combination
of these forces—police, white terrorists, Southern Democrats, and North-
ern liberals—ultimately defeated the enslaved people, who had struck
off their bonds, created a social revolution in the South, and won a war
against their former masters. Anti-Black violence, carried out by the state
and its volunteers, ensured that emancipation would not mean equality,
freedom, and justice for all any more than the Constitution did. And
this continuity of racial violence did not merely harm the emancipated
people of the South.
As the United States followed its Manifest Destiny to the West Coast,
it furthered its genocidal displacement, internment, and war on Indig-
enous Americans. With the conquer and occupation of large swaths of
Mexico, the American border crossed lands inhabited by Chicanx peo-
ple, who increasingly found themselves the targets of murderous white
dispossession. So too did the Asian workers brought across the Pacific to
build the cities, railroads, farms, and mines of the West. This violence
was also turned against anarchists, communists, socialists, and radical la-
bor, many of them newly arrived German and Italian immigrants who
were not yet considered white.
It is well beyond this book to even begin to look at or analyze all
the riots, lynchings, and police violence that occurred across America
between Reconstruction and the Black Freedom movement of the six-
ties. What’s notable, though, is that the police, alongside white collective
punishments, played an increasingly central role in society and became
a crucial factor in all of the transformations occurring throughout the
country. Urbanization, industrialization, western expansion, Black in-
ternal migration, labor struggles, American imperialism, political ma-
chines, and “gilded age” financial and corporate concentration of wealth
all relied on or responded to police and vigilante violence in their daily
enactments.
Race riots and lynchings were a way of “stabilizing” white suprema-
cist settler-colonial capitalist hegemony—by terrorizing and disorganiz-
ing the American proletariat, by transferring wealth and power to white


```

```
capitalists—while the police served as a new tool for legitimizing and reg-
ulating this violence. The historical emergence of the police, and their
relationship to fugitives, urban slave patrols, colonial administration, and
crowd suppression, helps us analyze looting and rioting in the present.
The proposition that history does not primarily happen in parlia-
ments or on battlefields but rather in workplaces, in homes, in theaters
and schools, in factories, and in the streets refers not only to the history
of resistance and revolution but also to its repression, deferral, and de-
struction. And in the United States, the forces doing that everyday work
of repression, deferral, and destruction have tended to wear a blue cap or
a white hood.

If standard American history forgets, domesticates, decon-
textualizes, or de-radicalizes revolutionaries, the police are so embedded
within the ideological reproduction of the present that they are hardly
imagined to have a history at all. As historian of the police Kristian Wil-
liams writes, people “seem to imagine that the cop has always been there,
in something like his present capacity, subject only to the periodic change
of uniform or the occasional technological advance.”^1 Luckily for those
of us who think that there will be no justice without the total abolition of
police forces, however, modern police departments are a relatively recent
phenomenon, with even the oldest forces being just over two hundred
years old.
As anyone who has followed their actions or battled against them in
the streets knows, different local police forces in America have different
tactics and different relations to their municipal governments and vary-
ing levels of power—though they share the same structural goals and
behaviors. This is because they have different local histories, and so any
unifying story of the police in America is necessarily generalized and will
have exceptions. Still, tracing this outline not only helps us to denatural-
ize the police and thus imagine a world without them but also recognize
the way that looting makes immediate sense as an antipolice tactic. To


74 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

do so, we will follow the distinct but similar development of three of the
earliest police forces: London’s Metropolitan Police, the New York City
Police Department, and the Charleston City Guard.

The history of the police in America begins with their prede-
cessors in England. For more than six hundred years, comprising the En-
glish Middle Ages up into the eighteenth century, policing functions in
English towns and villages were distributed among a number of different
people. In the main, the law was upheld by communal agreement among
the heads of households. These literal patriarchs had jurisdiction over
either groups of ten people (a “tything”) or ten tythings together (a “hun-
dred”) into which the community was divided. Victims of a crime pled
their own case before these patriarchs and pressed charges themselves.
Other policing duties, such as tax collecting, enforcing royal decrees, or
mustering a militia or a posse comitatus to capture fugitives, were spread
out among a number of other officials, including various constables and
a monarch-appointed sheriff.
The only force patrolling towns was the night watch. Night watch-
men were unpaid, unarmed, save a lantern and a staff, and mostly func-
tioned as a human alarm system, raising “the hue and cry” in case of
crime or fire, with the intention of gathering other people to deal with
the situation together. Watch duty was required of all male residents of a
town, and was deeply resented. For the centuries that they were the main
force of order, watchmen had a propensity to wander the streets blind
drunk, and they hardly instilled fear in would-be criminals.
Across the eighteenth century, however, the London watchmen
transformed to reflect rapid changes in the city. English cities grew rap-
idly through the early Industrial Revolution, beginning in this era. Urban
growth was driven by the process of enclosure, in which the state and
landlords privatized England’s common grazing and agricultural land,
rural land that had previously been free for all to use. Peasants who had
for generations worked on these commons, who had subsisted on their
own agricultural produce, found themselves unable to pay the new fees


```

```
and rents suddenly required for use of the land they and their forebears
had farmed for centuries. Without a place to farm, and thus without a
way to grow food or subsist, peasants were made homeless and plunged
into desperate poverty by these laws and land grabs.
Many left the countryside to find work in the towns, where they
ended up living in densely packed slums. This new urban poor proved
the crucial factor in growing the ranks of the rich and the merchant “mid-
dle classes,” who could profit off paying these country bumpkins terrible
wages for grueling work and charging them high rents for miserable hov-
els. Where once towns were small settlements where rich and poor often
lived more or less side by side, as cities grew, classes also increasingly
stratified in their daily lives, making for entirely different experiences of
the city in completely separated neighborhoods.
This great mass of newly impoverished people tended to resent their
bosses and landlords—who stole their lives week by week through rent
and wage—and tried to live the best they could in spite of it all. They
skipped out on work and contracts, didn’t pay their debts, drank, caroused,
gambled, and behaved in all sorts of “immoral” ways—the same leisure
and economic activities practiced by the English aristocracy, of course,
but suddenly immoral when practiced in public by former peasants. This
“immorality,” crucially, was not violent: violent crime actually dramat-
ically decreased during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
These people merely hadn’t internalized or didn’t respect the new eco-
nomic and social relations developing in the period and had to be forced
to recognize the “rational,” “natural” ways of the new system of property,
commodity, labor, and contract.
As one method of keeping these newly dispossessed in check, various
London watch organizations took up modernizing experiments, most
significantly paying watchmen, but also hiring more men, increasing
hours of operation, granting pensions, and purchasing modern equip-
ment and weapons. They also increasingly criminalized debt, unem-
ployment, gambling, drinking, and public gathering: transforming
people into criminals is one of the core methods of social control under
capitalism. But, although the night watch and other early experimental
police forces were capable of punishing individuals—public hangings

became an incredibly common spectacle in eighteenth-century Lon-
don—they could do nothing to control the new proletariat when they
gathered and acted as crowds in the streets, increasingly riotous, in or-
ganized demonstrations, strikes, and the “disorderly” use of city streets
for socializing, informal business, and as living spaces. The government
found itself facing new, massive crowds with only one tool for suppres-
sion: the army.
But, as historian David Whitehouse notes, “there are really only two
things the army could do. . . . They could refuse to shoot, and the crowd
would get away with whatever it came to do. Or they could shoot into the
crowd and produce working-class martyrs.”^2 What could the state do to
keep these people paying rent and going to work and not, say, recognizing
their own power, taking over society, and changing it in the interests of
all? How could it regulate repressive violence so that it maintained order
without producing conditions of outright civil war? Robert Peel, then the
home secretary, hit upon a solution in 1829 when he proposed Parliament
put into action a police force. His ideas transformed the various disparate
watches into the centralized, uniformed, twenty-four-hour-operating,
professionalized, citywide Metropolitan Police Force. These “bobbies,”
named after their founder, are widely (but inaccurately) considered the
first modern police force in the world.
Importantly, Peel did not introduce this innovation from thin air—in
previous years he had developed policing methods in a more openly bru-
tal and violent context, using his proto-cops to suppress and control Irish
populations during his service as chief secretary of Ireland.* These colo-
nial methods were, in turn, influenced by labor management techniques
developed in the West Indian slave colonies. English policing methods

*Robert Peel’s infamy includes not only brutal management in Ireland and the inven-
tion of the English police but also the founding and reinvigoration of the modern Con-
servative Party and, as prime minister, exacerbation of the Great Famine in Ireland. For
two years, he denied its effects, doing nothing while hundreds of thousands died, then,
when the suffering became too great to ignore, in 1846 he cynically used the famine to
repeal the Corn Laws and advance his cause of free trade—the repeal represents a cru-
cial governmental shift from supporting the landed aristocracy to supporting the bour-
geoisie. But, lovely man that he was, Peel set up the repeal to go into place gradually,
rather than all at once, so that its effects would not help the Irish come out of the famine
for another three years.

were developed to maintain imperial domination in the colonies, then
were applied to the newly developed striking, riotous poor and working
classes back in the metropole. The English police represent the internal-
ization of the empire’s colonial relations. The methods that best work to
stamp out colonial resistance also work to repress class conflict, allowing
us to see that class relations and colonialism are not always easily distin-
guishable: class power is in many ways fundamentally colonial.
In the northern American colonies, the development of the police
followed a similar trajectory. In eighteenth-century New York City, an
involuntary, ineffective, and unpaid watch combined with constables—
formal officers of the court who served warrants and summonses—to
make up the apparatus of order. However, because slavery was still legal
in New York, these watches were empowered to harass Black and Indige-
nous people—who were often under curfew—on the streets, demanding
passes and detaining, beating, or murdering those without them. After
the end of legal slavery in New York, the watch continued to enforce state
laws specifically targeting nonwhite people.
In the early nineteenth century, as the city swelled with immigrants,
particularly Irish ones (who were at this point still racialized and not
considered white), an ideology emerged among the rich that referred to
the “dangerous classes.” As this ideology developed, poor and immigrant
communities began to be regarded as officially alien groups with funda-
mentally different ethics and values. The drunkenness and “vagrancy”
of these “dangerous classes” were not recognized as a product of their
material conditions; instead, such behaviors were regarded as somehow
biologically inherent to their being (the Irish reputation for being drunks
has never gone away, but you might be harder pressed to find people who
think all Catholics are a degenerate force of laziness and moral decay
these days).
In other words, class was increasingly understood racially. The life-
styles of the dangerous classes were seen as a threat to social order, mor-
als, and the regular and dependable work-readiness industrial capitalism
required. The wealthy began to agitate for a more formal method of con-
trolling these unruly people, just as they did in England, despite the fact
that US cities saw a decrease in serious crime through the 1800s.


78 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

As in London, New York City crowds grew larger, more powerful,
and more disruptive. As mentioned in the previous chapter, in the early
decades of the 1800s Black New Yorkers rioted to prevent fugitives from
being returned to the South, which often resulted in violent battles with
the watch. During the same period, anti-Black race riots, instigated and
led by both “native” New Yorkers and European immigrants alike, target-
ing Black churches, theaters, and businesses became increasingly com-
mon.* The city also saw the emergence of militant strikes, which often
destroyed property and shut down entire neighborhoods. And finally, as
David Whitehouse writes, at that time workers “began to engage in more
and more ‘run-of-the-mill’ riots wherever crowds gathered. .  . . In the
opening decades of the century, there was one of these riots about four
times a year, but in the period from 1825 to 1830, New Yorkers rioted at a
rate of once per month.”^3
In response, the state legislature put into place a series of reforms
that would result, by 1845, in a professionalized, specialized, centralized
twenty-four-hour police force, just as Peel had done in London.
Whereas London’s Metropolitan Police Force shaped itself on Irish
colonial domination, the New York Police Department took many of its
organizational cues from the slave patrols of the South, and one of its first
major responsibilities was enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.^4
The NYPD as it exists today thus emerged to enforce the racial and
class hierarchies essential to urban capitalist development. To keep things
“orderly” meant, from its beginning, keeping the white and the rich on
top by protecting their property and keeping the Black, Indigenous,
immigrant, and poor in their place by limiting their organizing, street
presence, and political power. The police are an apparatus designed to
reinforce the white supremacist, bourgeois order. And that order finds
many of its origins in the practices and techniques developed in the early
days of settler colonialism.

*New York, with its bankers and merchants who managed business between the South/
the Caribbean and the North and Europe, had the most staunchly pro-slavery, pro-
Democrat, and actively anti-Black white population of any major city in the North.

The constancy of maroonage, resistance, and rebellion in
slave colonies and societies meant that settlers tended to develop spe-
cialized policing forces earlier than the metropoles, such as London or
New York, that grew off the profits from geographically distant planta-
tions. Howard Zinn notes that “in the 1520s and 1530s, there were slave re-
volts in Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Santa Marta, and what is now Panama.
Shortly after those rebellions, the Spanish established a special police
force for chasing fugitive slaves.”^5 Spanish, French, and English colonies
in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Americas all saw the development
of both semiregular slave patrols and professional slave catchers. In Bar-
bados, English soldiers were stationed in plantations exclusively to surveil
and control the enslaved, not to do any other work: a rare and noteworthy
historical fact, considering how valuable manpower was and how few En-
glishmen were brought to the Caribbean colonies. These forces tended
to lack some of the defining features of modern police departments but
serve as forerunners.^6
Indeed, the British colonists of the early continental South con-
sciously studied and copied the Caribbean model. Across the seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries, Southern enslavers developed voluntary
unwaged slave patrols, made up of plantation owners, their sons, broth-
ers, overseers, and other “trustworthy” white people. These patrols rode a
number of times a week, in the roads and fields between and within plan-
tations. They patrolled on horseback and usually carried guns, whips,
and rope. Though patrols varied from state to state, they were, like the
forces in the Caribbean, formed initially to capture fugitives, but very
quickly they evolved to also watch for and prevent slave uprisings.
As such, they harassed and captured any Black person found between
plantations. Free or enslaved, Black people were required to carry a pass
in order to travel alone. Being caught at a slave gathering or between
plantations without a pass resulted in lashings or even life-threatening
beatings. But a pass didn’t protect Black people from the whims of the
patrols any more than official ID protects Black people from the police
today: random violence, sexual assault, and robbery were common.
The patrols were sent in to break up and disperse any large groups
of Black people, whether groups formed as social gatherings, religious


80 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

meetings, or family celebrations. They also searched slave quarters and
homes for weapons, stolen goods, or any “signs” of rebellion. Police now-
adays rely on the legal tool of civil asset forfeiture—and the pretense that
they’re investigating drug crimes—to take whatever cash and valuables
they find in a car or a home they search. They seize items even if they
don’t find any guns or drugs, even if they search the wrong house, even if
they have a faulty warrant or have illegally stopped a car. This is a direct
policy descendant of the slave patrols, which could take anything they
found of value, regardless of any “real” signs of insurrectionary plotting
or actual stolen goods. While plantation owners benefited from the re-
pression of revolt and rebellion, stealing possessions served as a main in-
centive for overseers and volunteers, who made up the bulk of the patrol,
a significant supplement to their wages.
The slave patrols started off as informal groups set up by planters
themselves rather than by local governments, and before American in-
dependence, they tended to be autonomous, technically part of the co-
lonial militias but answering to no real official authority. As the slave
colonies became slave states, they enacted legislation that empowered
(and theoretically limited) the patrols as separate from militias. The huge
increase in the number of enslaved people in the United States at the
turn of the nineteenth century meant that these voluntary patrols proved
insufficient to discover planned revolts or stem the tide of fugitives, so
state governments often stepped in to fund patrols and make them stron-
ger and more organized. For example, in 1819, in response to two failed
slave revolts, a law was passed in South Carolina that required all white
men between eighteen and forty-five years of age to serve in slave patrols
without pay.^7
But even in the predominantly rural and agricultural South, policing
developed most quickly in the cities. Southern cities grew, and, though
small in comparison to the metropolises of the North, they, too, produced
their unruly crowds. As discussed in the previous chapter, Southern ur-
ban economies were built around the practice of enslavers “hiring out”
laborers to other employers in town. These enslaved workers earned a
wage from their bosses, most of which they would then turn over to their
enslaver. These laborers most often lived together, usually at a remove


```

```
from both their employer and their enslaver, and their daily lives outside
work unfolded mostly in Black neighborhoods called slave quarters.
Slave quarters were spaces of relative autonomy for the enslaved, and
as such were a cause of massive anxiety to the white residents of the cities,
who feared the possibility of Black peoples’ organization and righteous
rebellion. The neighborhoods were frequently outside of white control,
a place where maroons could organize and trade, where recent fugitives
could hide out and Underground Railroad stations could form, where
African, creole, and subversive Christian religious practices could flour-
ish, and where white people weren’t respected, deferred to, or welcomed.
Such communities presented an imminent threat to the slave order.
So Southern cities developed “city guards,” militarized forces of young
white men whose large numbers and modern weaponry allowed them
to patrol and control those quarters. Rather than evolving slowly out of
the traditional and ineffectual night watch, as the police forces did in
London and New York City, the urban guards of the South were adapted
directly from rural slave patrols and put into place directly to replace the
watch.^8
The first of these slave-patrol-cum-police-forces was the Charleston,
South Carolina, City Guard and Watch, incorporated in 1783. As Kristian
Williams writes, this force “represented a significant advance in the de-
velopment of policing.”^9 Armed, professionalized, and uniformed, with
the same officers working every day, the force patrolled Charleston in a
company rather than as individuals. It was a modern police department,
the first, perhaps, in the world. Similar “guards” popped up across the
South in the following decades.
Though these guards were ostensibly formed to stop crime, they
largely worked by instilling terror in the Black population. They raided
Black people’s homes, monitored and controlled their movement, en-
forced a curfew (for Black people only), and regularly mustered in full
force to parade through the streets behind fife and drum, armed to the
teeth, beating anyone they could catch, sending people fleeing ahead of
them.
Unlike in the rural areas between the plantations, Southern cities
required that the enslaved be able to move freely between their various


82 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

jobs and home, so a patrol that stopped and harassed everyone moving
through the streets was undesirable and unprofitable. The enslaved were
still required to carry a pass from their employers, and failure to produce
one could result in terrible violence, but unlike their rural counterparts,
the guard didn’t stop anyone and everyone they met. Thus, the Guard
and Watch developed the essential police tactics of selective enforce-
ment and random terror, which, alongside keeping Black people from
certain places (e.g., bars and public parks), became the everyday job of
the guard. As Williams writes, “This body was responsible for arresting
vagrants and other suspicious persons, preventing felonies and distur-
bances, and warning of fires. But one guard described his job succinctly
as ‘keeping down the n***ers.’”^10 The police are one of the first “color-
blind” institutions in American history: formal responsibility for urban
safety and crime prevention is simply a cover for enforcement of white
supremacy and anti-Blackness.
This emergence of a modern police force in the South was different
from that in London, which was different, again, from that in New York
City, but all three shared some clear tendencies. In all instances, the po-
lice developed as a formal governmental organization when the enslaver,
colonizer, and/or capitalist could no longer sufficiently protect their
property or control on their own the crowds of laborers they required. In
all three instances, the state stepped in to take over a repressive function
by forming an organization with a separate agenda from that of the army
or the militia: an armed bureaucracy under the aegis of stopping crime.
As we can see from the examples of London and New York City, the po-
lice did not evolve exclusively or simply in response to the chattel slavery
relation. However, police evolved and modernized earlier in cities with
slavery and appeared sooner in settler colonies than in their metropoles.
Police forces in the colonial center always took tactical, organizational,
and methodological cues from colonizing and enslaving police forces
in the outposts. The slave catcher is thus embedded in the DNA of all
modern police forces.
Many reactionaries confront abolitionists with the question: Well,
then, what do you replace the police with? But that question implies that
the police exist for generalized protection of the people. The police do


```
All Cops Are Bastards 83
```
not exist to protect citizens from crime, and they never have. As revolu-
tionary labor organizer Lucy Parsons observed, already true more than a
hundred years ago, “We have laws, jails, courts, armies, guns and armor-
ies enough to make saints of us all, if they were the true preventives of
crime.”^11 America currently has more police per capita than any nation
in Europe, and the highest rates of imprisonment in the world, yet it
continues to have higher rates of crime.
So, what do the police do? The police exist to enforce the rule of the
powerful few over the weak and many. I do not see a need to replace or
reproduce that function in a liberated society. As Mychal Denzel Smith
puts it: “What do you do with an institution whose core function is the
control and elimination of black people specifically, and people of color
and the poor more broadly? You abolish it.”^12

This transition from slave patrol to official police force is
mirrored by the similar transition of the object of police violence from
slave to criminal. Following the collapse of the Confederacy, in the very
first days of emancipation, Southern state governments attempted to re-
build the slave system in all but name by installing a series of new crim-
inal laws, the infamous Black Codes, vagrancy and convict laws. The
vagrancy laws are particularly telling. As Michelle Alexander writes,

```
Nine Southern states adopted vagrancy laws—which essentially
made it a criminal offense not to work and were applied selectively
to blacks—and eight of those states enacted convict laws allowing for
the hiring-out of county prisoners to plantation owners and private
companies. Prisoners were forced to work for little or no pay. One
vagrancy act specifically provided that “all free negroes and mulattoes
over the age of eighteen” must have written proof of a job at the be-
ginning of every year. Those found with no lawful employment were
deemed vagrants and convicted. Clearly, the purpose of the black
codes in general and the vagrancy laws in particular was to establish
another system of forced labor.^13
```

84 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

These laws were enacted immediately following the collapse of the
Confederacy, most of them installed in 1865 and 1866. This means that
the former rulers of the slavocracy understood that, although the legal
category of slave had been abolished, they could use the category of crim-
inal, and the enforcement mechanisms of the state, to return Black peo-
ple to a state of bondage. The fact that this happened so quickly reflects
the fact that state power was always already poised to serve this function.
Slavery in America did not occur in a legal vacuum or as an extrale-
gal system: slavery was maintained under the purview of constitutional
law. In the laws administering slavery, the Slave Codes, the equation of
Blackness with criminality was already strongly established. As Saidiya
Hartman writes, “The law’s selective recognition of slave humanity nul-
lified the captive’s ability to give consent or act as agent and, at the same
time, acknowledged the intentionality and agency of the slave but only as
it assumed the form of criminality. The recognition and/or stipulation of
agency as criminality served to identify personhood with punishment.”^14
Under this legal regime, the courts did not recognize slaves as legal sub-
jects—humans—unless they were accused of a crime. Black subjecthood
could only be understood through punishment, a logic initiated in the
slave ships but carried into the present through criminalization. Crimi-
nal law was thus a crucial part of producing and maintaining slavery, and
it has always been a key way of producing race in America.
The police of Charleston and other Southern cities thus served a
relatively continuous function across the event called emancipation. The
name given to the object of their gaze and their violence shifts to become
the “vagrant,” but the vagrant of 1865 was the enslaved of 1860: the police-
man and his target are still literally the same people.
It is rare to see principles so clearly delineated in history, but the
Slave Codes’ smooth transition into vagrancy laws and Black Codes is
a perfect example of the notion that crime is not some transcendental
fact of life against which the police nobly battle but is rather the thing
identified by the state and the police as a post facto explanation for the
repression they already carry out on behalf of society’s rulers.
And this transition from slave to criminal was not merely a function of
reactionary Southern governments: the Thirteenth Amendment, passed


```
All Cops Are Bastards 85
```
in 1865, abolishes slavery and involuntary servitude “except as a punish-
ment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” To this
day, the Constitution supports the enslavement of criminals: prison abo-
lition activists in the Free Alabama Movement and behind the growing
waves of prison strikes today insist that modern mass incarceration labor
regimes are a direct, legal continuation of slavery. Though the vagrancy
laws and Black Codes were struck down by the Fourteenth Amendment
in 1868, alongside the Thirteenth Amendment, they formed a precedent
for the segregation, convict leasing, sharecropping, and chain gangs of
the Jim Crow era.
Convict leasing was a horrific regime. As Angela Davis writes: “Schol-
ars who have studied the convict lease system point out that in many
important respects, convict leasing was far worse than slavery. . . . Slave
owners may have been concerned for the survival of individual slaves,
who, after all, represented significant investments. Convicts, on the other
hand, were leased not as individuals, but as a group, and they could be
worked literally to death without affecting the profitability of a convict
crew.”^15
The transitions from slave to criminal, from overseer to officer, are
not always improvements for those caught within the system, although
they are “reforms.”
We might begin to understand the police and their prisons, then, as
the most direct continued embodiments of the legacies of colonialism
and slavery in our society. Their function, from the beginning, has been
to maintain relations of colonialism, property, and slavery among races,
classes, and genders. If we are serious about ending the domination and
dispossession of white supremacy and settler colonialism, about making
reparations for that vast historical crime, and healing, one of the most
crucial steps must be to abolish the police. We cannot reform them. As
Davis puts it, “The entire history of police, the entire history of prisons is
a history of reform.” Reforms merely make these institutions more palat-
able, more acceptable in their task of caging, torturing, murdering, and
disappearing people. Anything less than the total abolition of the police
and prisons means keeping the colonialist and enslaving violence, ideol-
ogy, and control intact: that violence is what they are.


86 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

The self-looting fugitive was the spark for the genesis of the earliest
policing forces—the slave patrols—and enforcing federal fugitive slave
law was one of the earliest tasks of American police forces. Beyond the
loss of property she represents, the fugitive anticipates and precipitates
rebellion with her flight. The police have from the beginning existed to
protect racialized property relations from the threat posed by the looter,
the rebel, and the crowd. The looter is one of the historical nemeses of
the police: it is no wonder that, during antipolice uprisings, she reappears
again and again.
But if the looter reappears in uprisings against capital and the police,
hardly all rioters and looters in American history have fought against the
state, the police, or the regime of white supremacist property.
In the chaos of a collapsed economy and “way of life” in the wake
of the Civil War, gangs of ex-Confederate soldiers wandered the South,
using their soldierly skills to murder Black people and rob what little they
had. One of these groups of Confederates formed the Ku Klux Klan,
which would become America’s most powerful fascist popular movement.
First organized as a social club for white supremacist “pranksters” in
December 1865, the KKK’s racial terror, irony-drenched “pranks” quickly
transformed into lynchings, and the organization spread all across the
South. Its branches terrorized freed slaves, attacking and killing Black
leaders and occasionally the white activists who had come south to as-
sist them, in an attempt to destroy nascent Black political power and
re- enslave Black labor. They were joined in this task by other post-
Confederate Southern paramilitary white terrorist organizations, such as
the Red Shirts and the White Man’s League, which focused their attacks
around elections and taking out local Republican politicians and civil
servants.
White people behaved in the former Confederacy like apocalypse
survivors, using bare violence and terror to regain control of a South fun-
damentally shaken by social transformation. Polling places, then open to
Black people, could be sites of unspeakable violence, as white terrorists
attacked both Black voters and white people voting for the Republican
Party. The plantation owners may have been defeated in war and in law,
but they marshalled what power and wealth they had left to try to main-


```
All Cops Are Bastards 87
```
tain the system that had deemed them masters. In most of the South,
civil war continued at a lower level of violence for another decade, often
taking on the form of open combat, and even expanding into statewide
civil war in Mississippi and Arkansas.
Against these white terrorists stood the newly emancipated. A gener-
ation of Black people had realized their power through their great strike,
their emancipation, and their participation in the Union Army. Having
begun a radical transformation of society, they set about consolidating
those gains and pushing them forward. In some places they won local
and federal elections, built schools and businesses, and increased demo-
cratic participation; in others they carried on more militant insurrection,
following the outlaw traditions of maroon and Indian communities, loot-
ing and expropriating planters and owners in order to live on their own
land without bosses or work. This often took the form of outright armed
rebellion against bosses and landowners, as in the Ogeechee Insurrec-
tion of 1868–1869, when hundreds of Black rice farmers in the Ogeechee
Neck of Georgia, fed up with stalled negotiations with the bosses, armed
themselves, rose up, kicked the owners and overseers off the farms, and
occupied them, forming an autonomous commune.^16 The formerly en-
slaved people of the South became, briefly, the heralds of a different
world. And they sometimes did so with the improbable support of the
federal government and Northern capital.
Whereas a portion of the support from the North stemmed from
solidarity with radical abolitionists, most of it came from capitalists and
politicians who recognized that, in the power vacuum created by the
Confederacy’s collapse, they could finally crush the planter class, cap-
turing and rationalizing the Southern economy and government toward
the needs of industrial capital in the process. As a result, federal support
tended to emphasize reforms that transformed the newly emancipated
Black people of the South into wage workers, sharecroppers, and debtors.
This worked against or deemphasized the radical autonomy and agrarian
land reform—succinctly captured by the rallying cry of “forty acres and
a mule,” promised in General Sherman’s Special Field Orders that re-
distributed land in the Sea Islands—that emancipated people across the
South anticipated and had fought for.

Reconstruction is an incredibly important moment in Ameri-
can history. Some currents within it—those led by the newly emanci-
pated—flowed toward a different trajectory for Black people in America,
a trajectory marked by Black autonomy and sovereignty, by real social
transformation. But another stream shows the power of liberal elements
of the bourgeoisie to pacify liberation movements and repress revolution-
ary social change in favor of their own interests. The period also saw states
and vigilantes develop methods of white supremacist retrenchment, em-
powerment, and violence that last to this day.
Some of the more formal political currents are well summarized in
the Sojourner Truth Organization’s Introduction to the United States:

```
The Reconstruction acts passed by the radical-dominated Congress
disenfranchised former Confederate officials and stationed federal
troops in the South to protect the voting rights of the former slaves.
Under these conditions, Reconstruction was carried to its furthest
extent in South Carolina and Mississippi, the two former pillars of
the Confederacy and the only states with a black majority. Of the
delegates to a convention called in South Carolina for the purpose
of writing a new state convention, almost half were former slaves and
another fourth were so poor that they paid no taxes. Has the world
ever seen a parliament of purer proletarian composition?^17
```
The Reconstruction legislatures enacted a series of laws that brought
the South the most extensive, and in some cases the only, social reform
it has ever known. Child labor laws, free public education, women’s
property rights, credit structures to enable the poor to obtain land—these
and other measures flowed out of the law-making bodies that the men of
property, north and south, denounced as “parliaments of gorillas.” And
behind these legislatures stood the Black masses.^18
But this Northern support, quite unified in the years immediately
following the Civil War, fractured and dissolved along class lines. Once
Northern capital had installed itself fully in the South, once planter
power had been broken and Southern agriculture had been revived along
lines of wage labor and sharecropping, the industrialists and politicians


```
All Cops Are Bastards 89
```
withdrew their support for Reconstruction. The capitalists didn’t want
Black and working-class autonomy any more than the white terrorists did:
they had merely wanted those pesky Southern “gentlemen” out of their
way and sufficient stabilization of the South to maintain access to cheap
labor and raw materials.
While the reforms and work of Reconstruction in the South are often
credited to Northern carpetbaggers, by both Southerners at the time and
proud Northern liberals today, few are happy to talk about the extent to
which the great white supremacist capitalists of the post-Reconstruction
South also came from the North. We can’t forget that after the plantation
class disappeared almost entirely, it was not replaced by entrepreneurial
Southern yeomen. Instead, Northern industrialists and bankers, many of
whom saw an opportunity in the collapsed region, moved into the South
in the years following the Civil War. The sharecropping, convict leasing,
and segregation that so resembled re-enslavement were carried out on
behalf of Northerners as much as for Southern white supremacists.
The liberals of the Republican Party were happy to grant the ex-
Confederacy a states’ rights (then as now, code words for white suprem-
acist) basis for racial and social issues in return for swift reunion of a
national free market and a more centralized federal executive regulat-
ing trade and commerce issues, most importantly railroad expansion.
As Neal Shirley and Saralee Stafford put it, “Whatever the benevolent
intentions of individual Radical Republicans may have been, Yankee-
engineered Reconstruction was chiefly a step in forcefully reintegrating
newly available populations of desperate and destitute former slaves into
industrial and agricultural production.”^19 The dozens of insurrections,
communes, and maroon societies formed in the aftermath of the war
were either crushed or slowly starved out by both white vigilantes and
Northern backstabbing.
This all became finalized when, in 1876, the Republican Party fully
betrayed and destroyed even the liberal parts of Reconstruction. In the
“compromise of 1877,” Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops
from the South, troops that had been the guarantors of Reconstruction, in
exchange for the Democrats conceding the presidential race. White vig-
ilantes, who had been violently fighting for the white supremacist order


90 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

for the entire period, found their most powerful antagonists in the effort
withdrawn, and in the years following 1877, white “redeemers” across the
South purged Black officials—sometimes at gunpoint or amid rioting—
and ushered Democrats back into office, then putting in place laws that
foreshadowed or transformed into Jim Crow, halting and reversing the
progressive gains of the Reconstruction period.
Those who argue that reform is “more practical” or “more realistic”
than revolution forget how easily reforms are rolled back to leave the
white supremacist, heteropatriarchal capitalist state in place. The gains
made in the midst of a civil war that led to 750,000 deaths, won by the
largest uprising in American history—the general strike of the enslaved—
and consolidated in a decade of local and autonomous governance were
traded away by politicians and leaders for the four-year presidential term
of Rutherford B. Hayes, and the freedom movement was set back for
decades to come.^20
Of course, this betrayal is merely the most clear and dramatic polit-
ical component of the ongoing nationwide process of white suprema-
cist retrenchment, a process that would continue well into the twentieth
century, a process of disenfranchisement, disempowerment, and work re-
gimes resembling re-enslavement that ensured a continuation of slavery-
like relations in America despite the technical end of slavery. And one of
the main agents in this process was the white lyncher, rioter, and arsonist.
The white supremacist looter.

chapter four (^) | WHITE RIOT
I
n standard histories, Jim Crow is largely conceptualized as
a legal regime. This suits the “postracial” narrative that sees the civil
rights movement, marked by legislative and legal victories, as the end of
racial justice struggles, a narrative that imagines that the greatest achieve-
ments of the Black Freedom movement were the various civil rights bills
of the mid-sixties. In this telling, Jim Crow was a series of Southern laws,
protected and upheld by bigoted white Southerners, that kept Black peo-
ple from achieving freedom: once struck down, the ultimate victory of
racial equality was ensured. As a result, the thinking goes, we now live,
finally, in an era of racial justice.
This absurd fantasy has largely been destroyed by the Movement for
Black Lives. It is belied by the facts of the prison-industrial complex, of
the anti-Black carceral state, by the surveillance, violence, and depor-
tation wielded against Latinx and Muslim communities in the name of
borders and antiterrorism, by the continued dispossession and genocide
of Indigenous peoples whose reservations sit on top of gas fields and in
the way of oil pipelines, by the election of Donald Trump.
But something fundamental did shift in the wake of the civil rights
movement: white supremacy was increasingly upheld by the state, the


92 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

police, and the prison-industrial complex rather than by a mix of state ac-
tors, volunteers, vigilantes, and rioters. As Naomi Murakawa points to in
her seminal The First Civil Right, one of the things that liberal civil rights
legislation ironically ended up doing was bringing the work of those vol-
unteers under the official policy of the federal government. By framing the
violence of extralegal white supremacist volunteers as a crime issue, and
Jim Crow as a question of bad laws and individual racists in government,
civil rights legislation under Truman and onward focused on producing
race-neutral criminal law and centralizing political power in the federal
government. These bills reined in de jure white supremacy and gave the
federal government authority to intervene with white vigilante violence,
but they also built the legal and political frameworks for a “color- blind”
criminal policy that would become Black mass incarceration.^1
It is not that these vigilantes ever disappeared, as Dylann Roof’s mur-
der of nine at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church
in Charleston in 2015 shows. Indeed, vigilantism is again on the rise,
with more or less direct encouragement from the Trump administration.
But in the ninety years between the Civil War and the civil rights move-
ment, lynchings, vigilante violence, and white riots occurred regularly, a
form of oppression as common, daily, and universal in the lives of people
of color as police violence and incarceration are today. The extent and
spread of the violence can be hard to imagine, but, particularly in the
decades immediately following the collapse of the Confederacy, constant
terror was often the only thing keeping white supremacist state govern-
ments together.^2
Less a formal legal regime to ensure water fountains remained seg-
regated, Jim Crow, which emerged in the South in the 1870s and 1880s
to be struck down only in the 1960s, was a reign of terror and violence,
protected by law but enforced by upstanding white citizens whose three-
piece suits hung cozily in their closets beside white robes.
And this great white supremacist terror was not contained in the
South nor restricted to anti-Blackness. Anti-Asian and anti-Mexican ri-
ots were common occurrences in the cities of the American West, cities
largely built by their labor, while the continued genocidal dispossession
of Indigenous peoples and all-out war on the Plains Indians were mythol-


```
White Riot 93
```
ogized as the romantic settling of the frontier. As European immigrants
filled American cities, riots occasionally attacked national or ethnic mi-
nority communities—Greeks, Jews, Irish, Czechs, Germans, Italians,
and others who, at various times, were not yet fully assimilated into
whiteness—though these people might be the victims of a mob one year
only to participate in aggressive mob violence the next. As revolutionary
movements developed, the same terror techniques were deployed against
leading activists and organizers—many communists, anarchists, and rad-
ical labor organizers were disappeared by the KKK or similar vigilantes.
And anti-Black riots and lynchings occurred all across the North, in Chi-
cago, New York, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Philadelphia, from Mapleton,
Maine, to Tacoma, Washington.^3
So why, if we want to understand looting and rioting as essential tac-
tics in fighting racial capitalism, is it vital that we see the role that riots
played in enforcing the white supremacist order? For one, it is important
to understand that rioting is a common political tool and, as such, can
be used for many different political aims: rioting is powerful. More im-
portantly, we can through this study tease out the differences between
liberatory rioting and its opposite and see the ways in which property,
violence, and race are organized differently in these separate riots. We
have to stop thinking of a “riot,” which can after all encompass so many
different functions—from sports celebration to overthrow of a regime—
as an easily grasped and unified concept. If we learn to pay attention to
the content, tactics, and actions contained within them, we can learn not
to dismiss, misunderstand, or reject moments of possibility for revolution-
ary change and start to think and strategize about how to move toward
that horizon.
I have tried, for the most part, to avoid detailed description or graphic
focus on violence against Black people and their bodies in this book,
because I follow many theorists in finding these descriptions predomi-
nantly a way of reproducing prurient consumption and political profiting
off of Black death. This danger is doubly likely if those descriptions are
coming from a non-Black author, let alone a white one such as myself,
and though I’ve worked very hard, it’s likely I’ve reproduced some of
those structures here through my own blind spots. Although I keep it

to a minimum, some depictions of violence seemed necessary to trace
the way lynching functioned in American political life. And the chapter
describes in general, if mostly nongraphically, moments of suffering, cru-
elty, murder, and assault. If this is likely to be traumatic or difficult for
you, I suggest you skip directly to the next chapter.

The myriad forms of white supremacist terror find their most
dramatic expression in two historically differentiated kinds of violence:
lynching and white rioting. The former mostly but by no means only
occurred in rural areas, the latter, mostly but not only in urban ones. In-
stances of both occurred across the entire time period between the start
of the Civil War and the civil rights movement—with perhaps the largest
race riots in American history the New York City Draft Riots of 1863 and
the lynching of Emmett Till in 1955, one of the initiating events of the
civil rights movement.
Broadly speaking, however, lynching was the predominant mode
of terror in the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction and the latter
decades of the nineteenth century, with the annual number of lynch-
ings peaking in the 1890s; rioting became much more commonplace at
the turn of the twentieth century, beginning in earnest in the 1880s and
reaching a peak in the Red Summer of 1919, which saw dozens of race ri-
ots all across the country, after which point both forms of terror subsided
some. The distinction between lynching and rioting is not always par-
ticularly meaningful: for example, many riots began when white people
were prevented from carrying out a lynching, and torturous, spectacular,
vigilante public murder—a decent basic definition of lynching—was one
of the main events of the riots.
Nevertheless, a gradual shift toward rioting occurred across the
post-Reconstruction era. This change partially reflects the continuous
migrations of Black people out of the rural South—where conditions of
sharecropping, convict leasing, and debt peonage were so similar to those
under slavery that Frederick Douglass, after a tour of the South in 1888,
called emancipation “a stupendous fraud”—into industrializing cities in


```
White Riot 95
```
the North and the West, as well as general and increasing urbanization
across the country.
These migrations were political movements, or flights of freedom.
The first major wave of migration, known as the Exoduster Movement,
saw forty thousand Black people, disillusioned by the collapse of Recon-
struction and by white supremacist violence, organize and migrate from
the Mississippi valley to the Great Plains in 1879. Migrations continued
throughout the period, in waves large and small. Migration north and
west was not simply an aggregate of personal flights for safety but a politi-
cal tactic against sharecropping, lynching, and oppression—it was a form
of strike that had, after all, served effectively under slavery. Migration was
famously advocated as such by the country’s largest Black newspaper,
the Chicago Defender, as well as by other antilynching publications and
organizers.*
During high points of organization and agitation, or in the face of
particularly intense labor injustice or white violence, the majority of a
Southern town’s Black population might pack up and migrate within
days or weeks of each other, leaving white landlords with crops rotting
in their fields. In one of the contradictions of action produced by white
supremacy, racist vigilantes and police forces would ride out to try to stop
trains from leaving for the North, to try to keep the Black people they
hated in their towns and counties. This means that the concentration of
Black people in Northern and midwestern cities already represents some-
thing of a form of protection and resistance against white terror, because
it reflects both flight from the places where that terror was most concen-
trated and formation of communities capable of more ready self-defense.
It is also why urban police forces become an increasingly important force
in white supremacist domination.
The trend from lynching to riot thus also reflects resistance and or-
ganization among the Black community, whose struggles across this pe-
riod are often skipped over in standard histories. These people, who had
brought themselves out of slavery, who had struck the fetters from their

wrists, did not simply fall silent as Reconstruction collapsed, as the coffle
was refashioned as the chain gang, the slave hut rechristened the share-
cropper’s hovel. Though they and their children’s movements are less
well remembered and often less spectacular or legible as “protest,” these
generations did not live submissively and unhappily under Jim Crow,
doing little until tension and anger finally boiled over into the civil rights
struggle in the fifties. A continuity of Black armed resistance, struggle,
organizing, and self-defense against white supremacy runs through the
period that is crucial to remember and learn from.^4
However, that continuity of resistance faced an organized and thor-
ough campaign of white supremacist terror. It is important to insist how
consciously lynching was used as both a political weapon of oppression
and a tool of white community consolidation, particularly because we are
living through a second era of lynching: many more Black people have
been murdered by police in each of the last few years than were lynched
in 1892, the worst year of that terror, which saw 162 people killed.^5 *
Usually not chaotic, sudden, or disorganized bursts of violence,
lynchings were instead prepared for days, even weeks in advance, called
for and explained by community leaders, hyped and built up in local
newspapers. Though some lynchings happened in the dead of night,
many occurred in broad daylight and appeared as nothing so much as
massive popular festivals. Free trains might be organized to bring white
people from the surrounding rural counties to the town of the lynching,
where crowds paraded the victim from jail to the site of the lynching:
there white families might picnic before or after the murder, while enter-
prising white entrepreneurs might sell popcorn and lemonade.
Though white people north and south usually claimed and believed
that the regime of lynch law was a response to sexual violation of white
women, Ida B. Wells’s investigations showed that the actual proximate
causes for lynching were various: “Of these thousands of men and women
who have been put to death without judge or jury, less than one-third of
them have been accused of criminal assault.” Wells lists the reasons for

*However, because the Black population has increased four times since then, lynching
was more common per capita, at least in 1892—though such morbid math completely
misses the way this form of terrorism operates.

lynchings: for accusations of murder, robbery, arson, burglary, “race prej-
udice,” “quarreled with white men,” making threats, rioting, miscegena-
tion, and in many cases “no reasons were given, the victims were lynched
on general principle.”^6 Such a varied list belies the claim that lynching
was in response to crime: the reproduction of white supremacy was its
reason and its cause, plain and simple. The modern-day regime of police
lynching has a similarly absurd list of instigating causes, including selling
CDs, playing in a playground, walking in the middle of the street, and
holding a toy gun in a Walmart.
But just as the arbitrary nature of the violence was crucial in enforcing
terror in the Black community, unifying claims around sexual violence
were crucial to justifying the violence to the white “community.” Wells
demonstrates how this regime of lynching, validated as the “protection”
of white womanhood, functioned as a two-directional re-enforcement of
white supremacist patriarchal power. Hazel V. Carby summarizes Wells’s
argument: “White men used their ownership of the body of the white
female as a terrain on which to lynch the Black male. White women felt
that their caste was their protection and that their interests lay with the
power that ultimately confined them.”^7 Lynching solidified a politics that
used the Black male sexual threat to defend white violence—a thread
that still runs through many carceral white feminist projects that appeal
to the state and its police and prisons for protection.
Photographs of lynching victims’ remains were taken and turned into
postcards, which participants sent to friends and loved ones, and white
people sometimes scrambled to take scraps of clothing or even pieces
of the victim’s body as souvenirs. Though individuals might have, as a
group they felt no shame or confusion about what they were doing; on
the contrary, lynchings could be a major form of social gathering and
togetherness in rural white communities.
In the period, white people, more commonly but hardly exclusively
in the South, thought of lynchings the same way we are taught to think
of criminal trials today: as an integral part of American democracy and
society, as a crucial mode of criminal justice. The criminal courts and
their police agents today do the same work of white supremacist terror
and oppression as the lynch mobs of the nineteenth century, though

their exploits, rather than watched or participated in directly in the pub-
lic square, are instead heroized through the news and through social and
popular media about courts, cops, and vigilantes.

As part of the suppression of Black power in the aftermath
of Reconstruction, white supremacists, especially in the cities, used their
own forms of looting and rioting. If the tactics, on the surface level, are
the same as those defended in this book, the goals were fundamentally
different.
During the Ferguson uprising, a tongue-in-cheek political hashtag
sprang up on Twitter, #suspectedlooters, which was filled with images
of colonial Europeans, plantation owners, cowboys, and white cultural
appropriators. Similarly, many have pointed out that, had Africa not been
looted, there wouldn’t even be any Black people in America. These are
powerful correctives to arguments around looting rioters, and the rhe-
torical point—when people of color loot a store, they are taking back a
miniscule portion of what has been historically stolen from them, from
their ancestral history and language to the basic safety of their children
on the street today—is absolutely essential. But purely for the purposes of
this argument—because I agree wholeheartedly with the political project
of these campaigns—what white settlers and enslavers did wasn’t mere
looting.
It was genocide, theft, and cruelty of the lowest order. But part of how
slavery and colonialism functioned was to introduce new territories and
categories to the purview of ownership, of property. Not only did they
steal the land from native peoples, but they also produced a system under
which the land itself could be stolen, owned by legal fiat through force
of arms. Not only did they take away Africans’ lives, history, culture, and
freedom, but they also transformed people into property and labor power
into a saleable commodity.
White supremacist rioting thus served to strengthen this everyday rob-
bery known as the law, as property, as society. White rioters aim to keep
people of color from developing autonomous economic, political, or so-


```
White Riot 99
```
cial power as much as possible, or to crush it where it has appeared. To
do this, they produce submission, fear, and economic ruin in the people
they attack. White supremacist race riots thus tend to feature significantly
more personal violence than they do attacks on property, more property
destruction than looting, and, when looting occurs, these white rioters
tend to target people’s homes and persons much more than these items
are targeted during antipolice/anticapitalist uprisings, which tend to fo-
cus on stores and workplaces.*
We can see the extent to which looting is not a natural feature of
the white supremacist riot, ironically, from one of the historical exam-
ples when it occurred to a significant degree. The Elaine, Arkansas,
riot of 1919, the final and bloodiest event of the infamous Red Summer,
is one of the most violent and horrible incidents in American history.
Over sixty- some hours, white rioters killed an unknown number of Black
sharecroppers and their families, then looted a valuable cotton crop those
sharecroppers had grown and picked. At least 150 people were killed, but
some estimates put the numbers as high as 850 people murdered.
This attack—if the latter number is correct, the deadliest race riot in
American history—took place not because of some supposed crime or
outrage but because the sharecroppers had organized. Refusing to con-
tinue purchasing overpriced farming supplies through their white em-
ployers or selling their crops for a tenth of what they were worth, the
sharecroppers of Elaine instead formed a union and hired a lawyer to
guarantee that they would be paid market price for the year’s bumper
cotton crop.† As Ida B. Wells, whose activism and journalism are essen-
tial to understanding the social production of lynchings and race riots,

*This is not to make a moral distinction between looting and property destruction or to
imagine that property destruction is “worse” or more white supremacist than looting.
Property destruction has been just as much a significant part of liberatory uprisings as
looting. It is merely a historical fact that the system already guarantees that most of the
products of people of color’s labor goes to white people. When it did occur, looting often
reflected the mixed class composition of white supremacist riots: lynch mobs and rioting
masses were often led by the respectable heads of communities, but working-class white
people took part, too, and used them as occasions to literalize the wages of whiteness.
†Massacres and white riots were a common method of repressing Black worker organi-
zation—in Thibodaux, Louisiana, in 1887, thirty-two Black sugar plantation workers on
strike, including Black union leaders, were massacred by a white mob.

pointed out, while general strikes by white labor unions were shutting
down whole cities in the North without facing mass murder, merely or-
ganizing a union and demanding the most basic economic rights proved
to be deadly for Black sharecroppers.*
The riot began when whites from Elaine and nearby counties sur-
rounded the Hoop Spur church, three miles north of Elaine, where the
sharecroppers’ union was having a general meeting, a gathering that
included children and old folks, full families. At a certain point, per-
haps once all the vigilantes had arrived, the white landlords, sheriffs, and
farmers who encircled the church fired guns indiscriminately into the
building. Though a couple of Black organizers had come armed and,
guarding the doors, fired back—killing one white man, though it’s also
possible he was shot in the back by his white compatriots—the Black
sharecroppers were significantly outgunned, and unknown numbers died
in the church. After those who could flee escaped into the surrounding
countryside, the white rioters burned the church to the ground without
removing the bodies of their victims. As so often is the case with Black
people murdered by America, the number of dead is unknown.
The next day saw a full-out murderous rampage. As Wells describes
it: “Hundreds of . . . white men were chasing and murdering every Negro
they could find, driving them from their homes and stalking them in
the woods and fields as men hunt wild beasts. They were finishing up
the job from the night before.”^8 The Black residents who survived did
so by fleeing the town and hiding in the woods for days. Late the second
day, after nearly forty-eight hours of this violence, federal soldiers were
sent in; their arrival forced white rioters to return to their homes. These
soldiers promptly rounded up and arrested any Black person they found
on charges of inciting the riot, putting them in stockades. They also mur-
dered a handful of Black people who had survived the initial mobs.
Later, Elaine’s white population would claim that the death of the
one white man at the church (and another killed the next day) was the

*Indeed, it would be over a decade, and only in the depths of the Great Depression,
before a sharecropper’s union would actually spread across the South and gain real ma-
terial power. And that union, too, would be harried by intimidation, evictions, riots, and
lynchings.

reason the riot happened in the first place. For these two white men
killed, twelve Black men, some of them labor organizers, were sentenced
to death for the riot. Black people were the only ones arrested or prose-
cuted for the events in Elaine.
One survivor Wells interviewed returned to her home for the first
time four weeks after these events to pack up her belongings and claim
the money owed for the cotton she and her husband had picked. Dis-
covering her house completely empty, she went to the white landlord’s
house to ask for the money owed her. The landlord told her she would
receive nothing and threatened to kill her and “burn her up” if she didn’t
leave immediately. During this ignoble exchange, she noticed her fam-
ily’s furniture and clothing in his house. As though that wasn’t enough,
after leaving with nothing but the clothes on her back, she was then ar-
rested in town by another landlord and put into forced labor for eight
days at the Elaine jail.^9
The white people of Elaine rioted to prevent Black people from
successfully organizing, to keep them indebted to white landlords and
trapped in the system of neo-slavery known as sharecropping. Tactically,
the difference between how and when the looting happened is instruc-
tive: the looting that did occur didn’t appear to actually happen during
the riot but rather in its aftermath, after federal soldiers had restored or-
der. White people taking Black people’s things is what happens under the
conditions of order, not the conditions of riot. The most common relation
to property in white riots is the simple destruction of Black people’s per-
sonal property rather than any organized looting of private businesses or
commercial goods. For example, in the East St. Louis Massacre, in 1917,
white rioters entered homes Black people had fled, gathered all their
things into piles, and burned them.
Anti-Chinese rioting in the West, meanwhile, was driven by rioters’
desire to steal jobs, not property. In these rarely mentioned atrocities,
white settlers—many of them working-class European immigrants—
rioted to take over industries largely built by Chinese laborers. Violent
assaults on Chinese immigrants had been occurring with shocking reg-
ularity since the Gold Rush of 1848–1855, at which time non- Indigenous
people began settling California en masse. European Americans and


102 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Chinese people made up the vast majority of this new population. The
extreme and common violence of the “Wild West” was real, but its vic-
tims were much more likely to be Chinese, Chicanx, or Indigenous
laborers than the white outlaws and their white sheriff nemeses mythol-
ogized in westerns.
Chinese workers did the mining, construction, and, crucially, the lay-
ing of the westernmost leg of the transcontinental railroad—a task almost
entirely done by “coolie” labor—transforming access to California from
a months-long journey into and through wilderness into a quick and sim-
ple fact of life for people in the eastern United States. But this task’s
completion in 1869 was a disaster for Chinese communities, because the
suddenly easy journey west meant a flood of European immigrants from
the East. Those Europeans, with their dreams of “finding gold boulders
lying in the streams” dashed, “demanded the jobs that Chinese labor
had created.”^10 They were supported in these demands by capitalists and
labor unions alike.
Chinese people were marched out of towns at gunpoint, lynched in
the streets, their businesses and homes looted and burned down, and,
eventually, they were literally outlawed with the federal Chinese Exclu-
sion Act of 1882. This bipartisan law, supported strongly by organized
labor, stopped all Chinese immigration and made reentry incredibly dif-
ficult (meaning anyone who had arrived but had left family or friends be-
hind in China had to decide to return to China permanently or give up
ever seeing their loved ones again).* Similar to Dred Scott before it, this
act held that Chinese people could not be and never had been citizens
of the United States.
Much as the Minutemen and other militia groups voluntarily patrol
the borders of Mexico today, in the new towns of the West it fell to white
rioters and vigilantes to enforce this act. And, much as anti- immigrant
sentiments today hold that immigrants are at fault for low wages, or-
ganized labor of the American West argued that the mere presence of
Chinese laborers depressed wages. Three decades earlier, their union

counterparts, who had been against emancipation, believing free Black
labor would be bad for white earnings, shared this racist ideology.
Organized labor therefore supported and perpetuated, both elector-
ally and through industrial action, violence against Chinese workers.
The Knights of Labor (K of L) was the preeminent labor organization in
America in the 1880s and one of the largest in American history, with at
one point over 20 percent of all American industrial workers as members.
The K of L had Black locals that participated in inspiring struggles in
the South, but its national and western offices were famously and openly
supportive of the Chinese Exclusion Act.†
In the 1880s and 1890s, a genocidal push was made to entirely remove
Chinese people from California and the West, one legalized and encour-
aged from above but driven by popular vigilante action from below. A K
of L local branch was behind the infamous 1885 expulsion of Chinese
residents from Tacoma, Washington, a major town with a population 10
percent Chinese up until that point. The most notorious of these ethnic
cleansing actions was the 1885 massacre in Rock Springs, Wyoming, led
by K of L miners, “where over 20 Chinese miners were killed by a storm
of rifle-fire as European miners enforced their take-over of all mining.”
As J. Sakai writes, “Similar events happened all over the West. In 1886
some 35 California towns reported that they had totally eliminated their
Chinese populations.” 11‡
As the twentieth century turned, this violence was continued and rep-
licated against the increasing numbers of Japanese, Filipino, and other
Asian immigrants. Filipino immigration was a direct result of US impe-
rial war on and colonization of the Philippines: settlers continued the

†This was in part to do with the largely decentralized and contradictory nature of the
K of L. Whereas the official leaders of the K of L—most importantly, its head, Terence
Powderly—were reactionary, racist, and totally opposed to radical industrial action, in-
cluding even simple strikes, K of L locals took action into their own hands. Thus, while
the K of L pushed Chinese exclusion in the West, radical workers in the South organized
under the banner of the K of L to pursue revolutionary agitation.
‡The cross-class, effective, and organized expulsion of Indigenous, Asian, and other
nonwhite peoples from the Pacific Northwest left a sinister political legacy: the mod-
ern American neo-Nazi movement has its roots in Oregon, and other white nationalist
currents have emerged from the now overwhelmingly white Oregon and Washington.

state’s colonial violence through a number of major anti-Filipino riots in
California in the twenties. FDR’s internment in 1942 of 120,000 Japanese
Americans, most of them from the West Coast and most of them citi-
zens, in concentration camps—which of course “opened up” thousands
of jobs for white people and “cleared” the land the Japanese workers had
been farming—is only the most well-remembered instance of the orga-
nized dispossession and domination of Asians in America.
The argument of this book is that when looting appears in an anti-
police uprising, it is a radical and powerful tactic for getting to the roots
of the system the movement fights against. The argument is not that all
instances of looting increase freedom, are righteous or politically anti-
propertarian. Rioting, property destruction, and looting are all tactics,
and though they may be more favorable to certain forms of struggle, they
can be and have been used to further differential and opposing political
goals and agendas.
Indeed, in the last ten years we’ve witnessed the right-wing and even
fascist appropriation of liberatory tactics that exploded onto the scene in
the revolts and revolutions of 2011. Winter 2013–2014 in Ukraine saw an
“occupation of the squares” co-opted by Far Right nationalists, while in
Thailand a right-wing middle-class mass movement calling itself “Occupy
Bangkok” tried to abolish parliament and install a military dictatorship
run by the king. Spring of 2016 saw a right-wing “soft” coup in Brazil that
was legitimized by a predominantly white, middle-class street movement,
which eventually led to the rise of fascist president Jair Bolsonaro. That
movement stole its tactics from the 2013 working-class uprisings against
public transit fare hikes and the gentrification, evictions, and corruption
of the World Cup and Olympics.^12 And in Turkey in July 2016, a failed
coup against president Recep Tayyip Erdogan ended with him calling
people into the streets and into Taksim Square to “protect democracy”
(i.e., his regime), despite the fact that he had been brutally persecuting,
imprisoning, and murdering people involved in the democratic uprisings
of 2013 against him that were first centered in Taksim. Indeed, Erdogan
used the coup attempt to push through the redevelopment of Taksim that
had sparked the 2013 uprising in the first place.

When a Donald Trump supporter said that “riots aren’t necessarily a
bad thing” in March 2016, she wasn’t thinking of Ferguson or Baltimore.
It’s Elaine or Rock Springs whose legacy she was evoking. And Trump
and his Far Right cohort’s intent focus on the media (both through at-
tacking “fake news” and turning Fox News and the like into de facto
policy organs) reflects a similar desire to return to the legacy of turn-
of-the-century media, which directly encouraged, supported, and even
caused white mob violence.

The dominant media is a tool of white supremacy and stead-
fast ally of the police. It repeats the lines the police deliver nearly verba-
tim and uncritically, even when the police story changes upward of nine
times, as it did in the murders of Mike Brown, Tyrone West, and San-
dra Bland. The media uses phrases like “officer-involved shooting” and
switches to passive voice when a white vigilante or a police officer shoots
a Black person (“shots were fired”). Journalists claim that “you have to
hear both sides” in order to privilege the obfuscating reports of the state
over the clear voices and testimony of an entire community, members
of which witnessed the police murder a teenager in cold blood.* The
media is more respectful of white serial killers and mass murderers than
of unarmed Black victims of murder.
This media collusion with white supremacy and the police is not
new. In fact, its modern form is incredibly subtle and crafty compared
to its turn-of-the-century manifestations. In the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, the relationship was more intimate, local, and direct.
And few writers or thinkers traced this relationship between white su-
premacist violence and the media as clearly and carefully as Ida B. Wells.
Quite frankly, many lynchings and white riots were directly insti-
gated, encouraged, and even produced by the media, which was, after

*“You gotta hear both sides” is a century-old white supremacist obfuscation. As Ida B.
Wells wrote in 1899: “The Southern press champions burning men alive and says: ‘Con-

all, owned by the men who most benefited from the white supremacist
power structure. The main form of media in the period was the local
newspaper, and these papers were not bastions of democratic truth nor
some noble fourth estate of society any more than Fox News or MSNBC
are today. Owned and operated by the richest and most “respectable”
men in their communities, these newspapers directly incited lynchings,
riots, and racial violence. The infamous Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, discussed
more below, was instigated by front-page headlines that read to lynch
negro tonight.
The Atlanta riot of 1906 was similarly prompted by a series of mis-
leading and outright false headlines about Black men assaulting white
women. A month before the riot, a man had been lynched in an Atlanta
suburb for an alleged sexual attack, and violent tension had been build-
ing all summer. But it didn’t boil over into a massacre until the media
got involved. On the night of September 22, the Atlanta Evening News
released three extra editions, separated from one another by only an hour,
with headlines proclaiming an attempted assault, then a “second” and
“third assault,” the latter perpetrated by a “fiendish negro” who attacked
a white woman in her backyard. As the newspapermen knew well, these
repeated extra editions meant that newsboys on every street corner would
be shouting out the news of black-on-white assaults all evening. As white
men got off work, some ten thousand of them formed into mobs that
terrorized Atlanta for seventy-two hours.^13
The Wilmington, North Carolina, riot of 1898, a coup d’état in
which two days of rioting brought down a mixed-race Republican gov-
ernment, installed a white Democratic one in its place, killed dozens,
and drove thousands of Black residents permanently out of Wilmington,
was largely made possible and given ideological force by the media. His-
torians recognize the Wilmington coup as a key moment in consolidat-
ing post-Reconstruction white supremacy, because it saw a white mob
overturn a legitimate election result, drive Black officials out of office,
disenfranchise all Black voters, and establish an officially white suprem-
acist local government. The coup was reported nationally, and the fact
that the federal government witnessed these events and did nothing to


```
White Riot 107
```
stop or overturn them demonstrated to the entire country that white vi-
olence and supremacy—not law or elections—formed the real basis of
American governance.
White Democrat newspapers unrelentingly slandering Black pub-
lic officials in their editorials laid the groundwork for the coup in the
months leading up to the 1898 elections. The day after Republicans (and
an aligned party called the Fusionists) again won the majority in the elec-
tions, a group of Democrats rallied a white mob to overthrow the elec-
tion result. The mob’s first act was burning down the offices of the Daily
Record. The Record, the local Black newspaper, had been running anti-
lynching editorials, some arguing, factually, that sexual assault on white
women was not in fact the cause of lynchings. The white papers reported
on these editorials incessantly in the days before the coup, claiming ab-
surdly that such words were encouraging sexual violence and that “white
womanhood” needed to be protected from Black Republican power as
embodied in these editorials. Creating white victimization and grievance
via willful misinterpretation of reality is one of the oldest tricks in the
settler-colonial book. The mob posed for photos in front of the burning
newspaper office, photos that would be published in Democratic papers
across the country.
The following year, the April 1899 lynching of Samuel Hose “was
suggested, encouraged, and made possible by the daily press of Atlanta.”^14
Hose had killed his white boss in self-defense. When Hose had the au-
dacity to ask for months of owed back wages to help pay for his grievously
ill mother’s medical care, his boss, rather than draw out his wallet, drew
his gun and told Hose he was going to kill him. Hose, who had been
chopping wood, threw his ax at his boss, killing him, and fled. The news-
papers reported it as a cold-blooded, unprovoked, premeditated murder.
Every day for a week, the Atlanta Constitution published double-
columned headlines about Hose “predicting” that he would be cap-
tured and lynched, in particular focusing on the detail that he would be
burned to death. Pretending that it was merely reflecting and reporting
on the mood of the public, day after day the paper beat the drum for his
immolation, making it a near certainty. When Hose was finally captured,


108 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

two thousand white people gathered and burned him alive. The next day,
the paper published a gruesomely detailed blow-by-blow account of the
lynching.
Today many in the current movement claim that the widespread
sharing and distribution of videos of police violence against Black people
represent a step toward justice—with some activists calling for body cam-
eras on police—but in fact, the widespread sharing of images of white
supremacist violence and Black death was an essential part of lynch law.
Not only did newspapers write moment-by-moment accounts of lynch-
ings and riots, but also photographs of lynching victims circulated the
country in prints and postcards, while cartoons and illustrations of lynch-
ings were a common sight in papers and political propaganda. Despite
the lack of televisual mass media or internet technology, images of Black
death proliferated—though the images were also sometimes used by
activists to produce moral outrage against lynch law.^15 But more often
than not, the media’s deployment of lynching images served to normalize
white supremacist violence, narrativizing it into a digestible and socially
acceptable form.
The media didn’t merely precipitate and incite racial violence, it
also defended the police and their role therein. The July 1900 race riots
in New Orleans, in which white mobs roamed the streets for a week
murdering any Black people they could find, erupted when policemen
attempted to arrest two local organizers, Robert Charles and Leonard
Pierce, for the crime of sitting on a stoop while Black. When Charles and
Pierce objected to being arrested, the officers drew guns, one putting his
to Pierce’s temple. Charles, who was armed, drew to defend himself, and
a gunfight ensued in which Charles and one cop were wounded; the cop
died of his wounds the next day.
Reporting on this in the next morning’s news, the two main papers
in New Orleans proclaimed the cops’ innocence and righteousness.
Lacking the instantaneous communications technologies and advanced
police–media apparatus of today, they failed to get their stories straight,
telling completely different tales of the gunfight. Nevertheless, just like
they do when police lynch people today, the media focused on smearing
the two Black men who had been assaulted by the police and defending


```
White Riot 109
```
the policemen’s actions. The Times-Picayune wrote Charles and Pierce
were “desperate men” who will “no doubt be proven to be burglars” and
that the neighborhood they were attacked in “has been troubled by bad
negros.” As a result of these inflammatory reports and insinuations, white
mobs formed and engaged in a week of mob violence and collective pun-
ishment as they hunted for Charles.
Not satisfied with instigating the riot, in the days that followed the
New Orleans police stopped Black people they found in the street—
when they didn’t simply arrest them—in order to disarm them, turning
their weapons over to rioters and leaving them defenseless against the
white mob. After outright participation and mass-arresting Black victims,
this disarming was the most common function carried out by the police
during race riots in the period.
The police didn’t intercept rioters or try to calm down white crowds
in Atlanta in 1906, Philadelphia in 1918, Chicago in 1919, or Tulsa in
1921: they merely arrested or disarmed the Black people. Sometimes uni-
formed police straight up joined in the rioting, though their relationship
to the action was frequently a little more subtle. Off-duty officers joined
white mobs, while on-duty police gladly gave prisoners up to white mobs,
though they would later claim, with unquestioning support from the me-
dia, that they were outnumbered and unable to do anything. Sometimes
this ruse was quite elaborate: police would secretly inform Klansmen
and rioters when and where they would be transporting their prisoners,
making it appear that the mobs had intercepted and overwhelmed them,
allowing them to look “innocent” and separate from the lynchings in
official accounts. Journalists and newspaper owners, themselves often
members of lynch mobs, would then dutifully repeat these stories of the
noble police being overpowered, thus clearing the state of responsibility
for vigilante violence and masking the deep interconnections of the vigi-
lantes, the media, and the police.
The dominant media and the police have long been mutually sup-
portive organizations, working together to maintain white supremacy

media is a necessary part of the state apparatus in a liberal democracy,
and though it might very occasionally “speak truth to power,” it usually
just speaks power’s truth. Marginalized activists, researchers, and report-
ers, like Ida B. Wells, must use their skills not only to “speak truth” but
also to use truth to organize and encourage action. But Wells’s reception
by mainstream history shows how revolutionary activism gets reduced
into speech.
Much as popular history domesticates Harriet Tubman, transform-
ing her from a revolutionary waging war against patriarchy, property,
and state into “a role model for leadership and participation in our de-
mocracy,” as Obama’s Treasury secretary Jack Lew put it, so has liberal
history disarmed and deradicalized Ida B. Wells. Search for mainstream
articles and historical accounts of Wells and you will learn that she was
a journalist-crusader against lynching who focused national and interna-
tional attention on the facts of white terrorism and was one of the most
prominent writers, thinkers, and activists of her day. You’ll also probably
learn that she cofounded the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP) and spent her later life campaigning for
women’s suffrage.
So you would be forgiven for thinking that her antilynching activism
was largely liberal, pointed outward from the Black community toward
“raising awareness” among powerful white people or bringing legal ac-
tion from the federal government. But that wasn’t so. Her popularity and
reach arose not only because she brought attention to and preserved em-
pirical evidence on the horrors of lynching but also because she proposed
and argued vociferously for more immediate solutions to lynch law: she
urged Black people in the South to migrate north, boycott white busi-
nesses, and arm themselves and get organized on the basis of self-defense.
As she wrote in 1892, “A Winchester rifle should have a place of honor
in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the
law refuses to give.”*

*The context surrounding Wells’s declaration is this: “Of the many inhuman outrages of
this present year, the only case where the proposed lynching did not occur, was where
the men armed themselves in Jacksonville, Fla., and Paducah, Ky., and prevented it.
The only time an Afro-American who was assaulted got away has been when he had a

Schools don’t teach the fact that W. E. B. Du Bois was a staunch
advocate of armed self-defense, let alone the fact that, as soon as news
reached him of the 1906 anti-Black riots breaking out in Atlanta, he raced
home from his research in Alabama to stand guard with his wife, where
they protected their home with a shotgun. They don’t tell you that A.
Philip Randolph, ally of Bayard Rustin and MLK, organizer of the Pull-
man Porters and honorary lead marcher in the 1963 March on Washing-
ton, spent his early career as founding editor of the radical Black socialist
magazine The Messenger calling for armed self-defense against lynching.
Although the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army are the
most famous advocates of Black armed self-defense, the tactic’s high- water
mark might well have been in the years immediately following World
War I, particularly during the height of the Red Summer of 1919. Most of
the major antilynching activists and intellectuals of the period—Du Bois,
Randolph, Wells, Lucy Parsons, Robert Abbott, and many more—agreed
on the centrality of armed self-defense. Even many within the more re-
formist leadership supported it. In 1919, a gathering of Black Methodist
bishops, repeatedly pressed, refused to denounce violence used to resist
white terrorism. Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Associ-
ation (UNIA) advocated self-defense against racist oppression in 1920.^16
And, indeed, many of these Black activists had been trained in armed
action as veterans of World War I.

War has always been a fundamental factor in capitalist expan-
sion and growth, a major tool of capitalist societies to increase and ra-
tionalize production, spur innovation, capture resources, open new
markets, capture foreign labor forces, keep profits from stagnating, and
centralize political power. But wars built around mass mobilization can
also be dangerous to capitalists, because they can produce social instabil-

gun and used it in self-defense. The lesson this teaches and which every Afro-American
should ponder well, is that a Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black
home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give” (Wells,
Southern Horror).

ity and chaos. Mass mobilization and generational war trauma can over-
turn traditional hierarchies and, as in the American South in 1861, Paris
in 1871, and Russia in 1917, create the conditions for social revolution.
In the run-up to US entry into the Great War, particularly from 1916
to 1917, the sudden increase in lynchings was no doubt linked to the
incredibly jingoistic propaganda that built the popular case for war—US
patriotism is always deadly to nonwhite people the world over. But, as
five million US soldiers demobilized at the end of World War I, white
vigilante violence made an even more dramatic upsurge. This spike in
violence reflects an attempt to reconstitute cisheteropatriarchal white su-
premacist capitalism in the face of numerous threats to its dominance
empowered and made visible during the war.
During the eighteen months of US mobilization, women had come
to play a major role in economic life and society in the absence of men,
doing men’s labor and learning “male” trades—by the end of the war,
women made up 20 percent of the industrial workforce, with much
higher numbers in health care and agricultural sectors. This empow-
erment came on the heels of the suffrage movement’s massive growth
and popularization in 1916–1917, as women were organizing politically
as women and publicly pushing for change. On the front lines, mean-
while, many soldiers, perhaps pining for suffragette fiancées back in
America, found comfort in each other’s arms: gay sex was commonplace
in the trenches, if deeply repressed, punished, and denied by military
hierarchies. No doubt many fiancées found the same queer comforts at
home. And masses of soldiers returned disabled, mentally or physically,
to reckon with and struggle against an ableist society that required neu-
rotypical able bodies to earn a living, a society that denied veterans and
people with disabilities sufficient benefits and care.*
At the same time, the revolutionary labor movement, enflamed by
the Russian Revolution and a seemingly imminent revolution in Ger-

*This group of veterans and their families would eventually form a massive protest move-
ment during the Depression. Called the Bonus Army, in 1932 they marched from all
across the country into DC and occupied the Mall in a tent city, sending out marches
and petitions and rioting against police. The movement was stopped only when Hoover
sent in federal troops, led by six tanks, to evict them in a bloody battle.

many, enlarged by a huge wave of radical immigrants, grew increasingly
powerful and militant: strike activity increased dramatically from 1914
through 1919. War production brought employment almost up to 100
percent, which meant bosses couldn’t easily find replacements for strik-
ers, and so labor action became more effective. And increased war pro-
duction meant hundreds of thousands of Black migrants from the South
found work in Northern industrial centers and entered industries once
dominated by white labor. The Great Migration of Black people out of
the South had one of its peak years in 1916. Black veterans, trained in
combat, who experienced greater freedom and power overseas, were rad-
icalized in large numbers after serving and gaining respect abroad in a
war they were ostensibly fighting for democracy, only to return to a racist
and oppressive society.
A generation of young white men, both empowered and traumatized
by their experience of war, felt enraged to return to an American society
struggling against their power on all fronts. Studies show that incidence
of domestic violence increases appreciably after sports matches and in-
crease much more dramatically among the fans whose team has won the
game. Victory is an emboldening experience for violent patriarchs—part
of why both war and victory are such highly valued principles in fascist
movements. In the same way, victory in World War I may well have fur-
ther inflamed the white men of America in their repressive activity.
The government saw the threats to the system clearly and initiated
what would eventually be known as the First Red Scare, which saw an
upsurge in both government repression and collective vigilante violence
against anarchists, communists, and labor organizers.
Simultaneously, the white people of America engaged in the biggest
wave of anti-Black collective punishments and riots in American history.†
White veterans’ groups and patriotic associations most frequently formed
the core of the angry mobs that participated in this violence.
But Black people fought back. The 1919 riots in Omaha, Nebraska

a well-established Black business district), Knoxville, Tennessee, Wilm-
ington, Delaware, and Dublin, Georgia, began when armed resistance
prevented a white mob from lynching a Black man. In Bisbee, Arizona, a
white serviceman harassed and attacked members of a Black cavalry de-
tachment: when the Black soldiers reported it to the police, the cops just
tried to disarm and arrest the Black cavalrymen who had been attacked.
But the Black soldiers did not relinquish their arms, and a gunfight en-
sued that ended only when the Black cavalrymen were fully surrounded
and arrested.
In Chicago, the Black community rose up after a group of white teens
killed a boy by throwing rocks at him and his friends because they were
swimming too close to the white beach.* A crowd gathered, demonstrat-
ing and demanding justice from the police, who had refused to arrest any
of the boys throwing rocks. The police merely arrested several of the pro-
testers. Mobs of white men, emboldened by police (in)action and gath-
ering in response to the Black uprising, attacked the protesters—some of
whom were armed, and most of whom fought back—and as news of the
fighting spread, so did the fighting itself.
Mobs Black and white gathered across Chicago, and skirmishes
occurred citywide, though violence was largely centered in the Black
Southside. According to Harry Haywood, a Black veteran of the war, his
neighborhood appeared “like a besieged city. Whole sections of it were
in ruins. Buildings burned and the air was heavy with smoke, reminiscent
of the holocaust from which I had recently returned.” But these white
gangs were just as often driven out of the Southside in gun battles or
killed in ambushes set up by Black workers and veterans. As Haywood,
who would go on to become a leader of the Communist Party, put it,
“Had race prejudice in the U.S. lessened? I knew better. Conditions in
the States had not changed, but we Blacks had. We were determined not
to take it anymore.”^17 These were the “New Negroes,” a movement of
Black people who expressed racial pride, who refused to submit to racist

*This is a classic example of the violence maintaining Northern segregation. Though
there were no Jim Crow laws, kids, adults, and police all violently maintained the de
facto distinctions between “Black” and “white” beaches, neighborhoods, and businesses,
even if, legally speaking, there was no distinction.

violence, and who would play crucial roles in Marcus Garvey’s Back to
Africa movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Communist Party, and
the labor movement.
These race riots reflect a much more complicated and conflictual
history than the tales of Black victimization and helplessness they often
come to stand for. Whereas some, like the Elaine Massacre, were direct
and successful attacks on Black autonomy—pogroms—others involved
extensive Black resistance and uprising that changed their meaning and
their effects.
The perfect example of this is the Tulsa riot of 1921. This riot has re-
cently been brought back into public consciousness by the important work
of activists and writers, and it is remembered now largely as the moment
when “Black Wall Street” was destroyed. The Tulsa riot saw the Green-
wood district, also called Little Africa, the wealthiest Black neighborhood
in America, burned to the ground in about sixteen hours of intense fight-
ing. Sometimes a partial history of this event is deployed to argue that
white people rioted predominantly because of that Black wealth. This
segues into the argument that such success—Black achievement of the
American Dream—should be the main goal for the Black community.
These analyses tend to exaggerate the actual economic power Green-
wood represented and downplay the role of Black self- defense in the riot.†
If the riot in Tulsa saw the tragic destruction of a symbol and com-
munity of Black power, why did many Black Tulsans who lived through
it look back on it with pride?^18 And if it was an emboldening victory for
white supremacy, why, after the riot, was there never another lynching
in Tulsa County, when lynchings continued for years in the surrounding
counties?
The Tulsa riot, like many of those discussed above, erupted after a
white lynch mob was thwarted in its murderous purpose. In this instance,

†“Whites owned a large portion of the land in the district. Furthermore, black Tulsa’s
service-oriented businesses were geared toward catering to a wage-earning population.
Few of them employed more than a handful of people. Economically, black Tulsa was
dependent upon the wages paid to black workers by white employers” (Scott Ellsworth,
Death in a Promised Land: The Tulsa Race Riot of 1921 [Baton Rouge: Louisiana State
University Press, 1992], 16).


116 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

the mob’s target was Dick Rowland, a shoeshine falsely accused of at-
tempting to rape a white elevator operator, which he allegedly did in her
elevator, in a public building, during business hours. The mob turned
riotous when armed residents of Tulsa, led by members of the Afri-
can Blood Brotherhood (ABB), intercepted and stopped the attempted
lynching.
The ABB, a clandestine pan-African all-Black Marxist revolutionary
organization, formed in direct response to the Red Summer of 1919. It
arose as a self-defense organization to empower and protect Black com-
munities from lynchings, collective punishment, and race riots. Though
it was founded in New York City, branches spread across the Midwest
and the South. A predecessor of the Black Panther Party, the ABB advo-
cated and agitated for armed self-defense, with a long-term goal of armed
insurrection and, ultimately, socialist revolution led by Black workers. A
chapter operated in Tulsa almost from the ABB’s inception.
Outside of the North, the ABB was an insurrectionary secret soci-
ety—being an out Black Communist in the Jim Crow South would have
been a death sentence—with an internationalist bent, working to foment
revolution while supporting and spreading information about the Rus-
sian Revolution and anticolonial struggles in Africa and the Middle East.
It did so through local organization and its newspaper, The Crusader.
Rumors of an imminent Black uprising or insurrection frequently factor
in to the buildup of white riots and lynchings—a direct legacy of lynch
mobs’ slave patrol predecessors. Such rumors were particularly strong
in white Tulsa in the months leading up to the riot and may reflect in-
creased radicalization and on-the-ground organizing in the Tulsa chapter
of the ABB.
In any case, when, the day after Rowland’s arrest, his lynching was an-
nounced and planned in the local newspaper (as mentioned above, the
May 31, 1921, Tulsa Tribune afternoon edition headline read to lynch
negro tonight), the ABB pledged to resist the lynching, and organizers
spread throughout Greenwood, urging residents to gather their arms and
head to the jail to protect Rowland.
At the jail that evening, some two thousand white people dutifully
gathered into a lynch mob. After two rounds of negotiations in which


```
White Riot 117
```
the sheriff refused to hand over Rowland, the mob prepared to storm the
jail by force. Some hundred or so Black men, some of them ABB orga-
nizers, arrived at the jail with rifles, pistols, and shotguns and offered the
sheriff assistance in protecting Rowland. As the groups faced off in front
of the jail, someone—it is not known on which side—fired a shot, and a
shootout began. The initial wave of gunfire lasted only a few moments,
but when the dust settled ten white mob members lay dead in the street.
The Black group, who had lost two of their number in the skirmish, re-
treated to Greenwood. Rowland had been successfully defended and
would survive the night in the jail.
From there a rolling gun battle unfolded across Tulsa deep into the
night, with white rioters trying to enter Greenwood but being repulsed
by Black snipers at the railroad track bordering the neighborhood. The
white rioters kept pushing, however, and on the morning of June 1, their
attack intensified as they deployed military machine guns and some even
flew decommissioned WWI biplanes over Greenwood, sniping and drop-
ping firebombs. This assault eventually succeeded in pushing the defend-
ers deeper into Greenwood and then out of the city, when white rioters
then turned to the expediency of arson. They set Black businesses and
buildings aflame, destroying much of the commercial main street and
surrounding residential district, looting and burning houses and stores
alike. The police, of course, worked through the night and the morning
to disarm, round up, and jail any and all Black people they could find,
incarcerating between four thousand and five thousand Black residents
for days. The arrival of federal soldiers meant the end of the rioting by
noon on June 1.
It had lasted less than twenty-four hours, but some fourteen hundred
buildings had been destroyed. Reports about the number of dead vary,
with some estimates claiming seventy-five dead, while others put the
number nearer three hundred. All accounts suggest that some significant
number—a third to half of those killed, in the case of the lower total
estimates—were white rioters. Although the numbers and proportions
will never be accurately known, many in Tulsa believed the true casualty
numbers were covered up because they would have become a source
of shame for the white community. It’s certainly true that the legacy of


118 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

the riot in Tulsa favors Black power: “during the 1950s and 1960s black
civil rights leaders used the threat of ‘bringing up’ the riot as leverage in
negotiations with white leaders” and, though white papers in Tulsa never
mentioned the riot thereafter, Black papers spoke of it openly and often.^19
The vast property destruction in Greenwood, however, proved to be
a massive loss for the white rioters as well, because most of the Black resi-
dents and business owners rented their properties: some two-thirds of the
real value destroyed in the riot belonged to white folks. In the aftermath,
Greenwood was rebuilt and flourished again. The white community
lived in fear of another riot, which it remembered with shame and hu-
miliation. Meanwhile, “for many Black Tulsans, the riot, and particularly
the rebuilding of their community, is an issue of pride.”^20
Was it only the legacy of Black Wall Street that Black Tulsans were
proud of, or was it also their armed resistance against white rioters? In
the months after the Tulsa riot, the ABB’s newspaper, The Crusader, used
the event as a point of nationwide recruitment. “What other organization
can claim that brave record?” the editors wrote about the action in Tulsa.
After the riot, there wasn’t another lynching in Tulsa County for seven
decades; only in the current era of police lynching has public white su-
premacist murder returned to Tulsa, and Greenwood was only truly de-
stroyed by a recent wave of gentrification.
This is not to deny that day in 1921 was tragic. The destruction and
loss of every Black life in that riot must be both mourned and avenged.
(I count every white rioter killed a victory.) It is a travesty of justice that
reparations committees, bills, and lawsuits failed through the nineties
and early aughts to give Black survivors recompense. But what happens
when we tell narratives of white oppression without including the stories
of brave, violent, and partially successful resistance to it?
There are thus two versions of the events in Tulsa: one that tells of a
white town destroying the Black American Dream, and another that rec-
ognizes Black armed organizers saving a man from lynching and fighting
back against a murderous white lynch mob. The former narrative em-
phasizes the Black community as eternally suffering peaceful victims of
white supremacist violence; the other, as an oppressed people organizing
and defending themselves, fighting for their lives. It is no coincidence


```
White Riot 119
```
that the narrative of total innocence and victimhood also foregrounds
peaceful economic advancement—Black Wall Street—as the real form
and goal of racial justice.
But this fantasy comes up against the fact that, under the white su-
premacist imaginary, Black people are never and can never be innocent—
even a Black president is liable to be treated as though he has suspicious
national origins and ascended to the presidency illegally. Indeed, notions
of criminality and guilt are synonymous with Blackness in America. This
racial logic of criminality produces a trap for antiracist organizing.
As Jackie Wang argues in “Against Innocence,” antiracist organizing
in America often forms around raising up individual victims of police or
vigilante violence. In order to do so, the victim is made to appear pure
and innocent. Because the “Black criminal” is legally stripped of subject-
hood and ideologically stripped of humanity, only total innocence—like
the youth and clean record of Trayvon Martin or Tamir Rice or Mike
Brown^21 —can make the victim legible as human, adequate for empathy,
and a legitimate subject of political action.
The press and right wing’s most frequent method to counter these
movements, therefore, is to deny the innocence of the victims. Mike
Brown was slandered as a thief, and the completely irrelevant fact that an
autopsy revealed marijuana in his system was widely reported. Similarly,
the media reported a rash of burglaries by Black men had occurred in
the surrounding neighborhood in the months before George Zimmer-
man lynched Trayvon Martin, and the right-wing press widely circulated
a photograph of Martin with his middle fingers up. Cleveland police
claimed twelve-year-old Tamir Rice pointed his toy gun at officers, a story
that was repeated and spread widely even after video was released proving
he did no such thing. This technique is more than a century old: in the
New Orleans riot of 1900, the press claimed Robert Charles and Leon-
ard Pierce would “no doubt” prove to be burglars and reported that the
neighborhood where they fought with the police was troubled by Black
crime.
But part of the reason that this right-wing tactic works in the first
place is because the terrain of “innocence” is one that already forecloses
a truly radical resistance to white supremacy. Though the method works


120 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

as a movement-initiating logic, by raising up and stressing the innocence
of particular victims of violence, Wang argues, these movements fore-
ground purity and noncriminality as the traits that signify people are
worth defending from violence. This may make a powerful argument
for a particular victim, but it reproduces the division between subjects
deserving of empathy and “Black criminals” who, as Sylvia Wynter shows
us, are not seen as human at all. This is precisely the structure of racial-
ized criminalization that produces and protects police lynching in the
first place, making it legible and possible.^22
This logic of innocence animates the desire to describe the Tulsa
riot as a moment of pure victimhood rather than as a messy, violent,
partial victory for the Black community of Tulsa. It feels strange, even
frightening to refer to the riot in Tulsa as anything other than a tragedy.
It is certainly not the romantic stuff of revolutionary fantasy: it is desper-
ate, bleak, neither clearly “political” nor ethically simple. Its history is
confused, bloody, and obscure; it does not fit neatly into liberal or pro-
gressive narratives of overcoming, of movement and protest, of conscious-
ness changed and political accommodations won. But it is, perhaps, one
form that victory might take when a small, outgunned, and overpowered
group, one deemed disposable, stands up and faces down a foe backed by
all the technology, force, state power, and ideology of their times.
When we treat the riot as a straightforward moment of victorious op-
pression, we not only ignore and disrespect the Black Tulsans who fought
back, but we fail to see that white supremacy is always lethal. To para-
phrase Martin Luther King Jr.: the absence of a riot doesn’t mean that
there is peace.*
There is no such thing as peace under current conditions. Social
peace is just the condition under which patriarchal white supremacist
violence is acting most fluidly and most thoroughly and is distributed
most invisibly. When white supremacist violence appears in the streets,

*“I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling
block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Councilor or the Ku Klux
Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who
prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the
presence of justice” (Martin Luther King Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail).

it is not an aberration or a dramatic change of direction: it is a continu-
ation of the world as it is in more direct, open terms. If we want a new
world, we have to learn to see in the policeman’s crisp blue uniform, in
the grinning politician’s handshake, in the banker’s penthouse suite the
whole howling violence of the white rioters and lynch mobs that helped
create them. Only when we find such “peace” intolerable will we be able
to envision what real peace might look like, and what it might take to get
there.

R
evolutionaries love organization. OrganizatiOn, similar to
community and democracy, is sometimes a carefully conceived con-
cept, but, more often than not, it is just a floating signifier, a moral value.
Organization is, in theory, the thing that keeps people activated, that
makes them capable of forming a movement powerful enough to counter
the work of the bosses, the ruling classes, and the state. Organization is
a good thing, a revolutionary thing. More of it makes a movement bet-
ter, less of it makes a movement more likely to fail. How do you know
whether a movement is sufficiently organized? Because the movement
wins! It is a tautological structure of faith. Like obscenity in the eyes of
the Supreme Court, the revolutionary knows it when they see it.
Perhaps that’s why so many otherwise self-proclaimed revolutionaries
oppose looting in social movements. The history of looting, and the riots
in which it occurs, is also often a history of “disorganization”—despite
the fact that rioters usually coordinate in complex ways. When looting
appears, it is not always as part of clearly demarcated political action or as
a part of organization-led movements fighting for social justice, although
it can both give rise to or emerge out of more formal movements.


124 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

This organization-ist tendency becomes particularly pronounced
in histories that inform our understanding of the labor movement in
America, which focus heavily on the formation of national trade unions
capable of winning demands through coordinated action. If we equate
organization, in particular the formation of unions, political groups, and
parties, with revolutionary activity, then we don’t see much looting at all:
when it appears, it does so as “opportunism” or mistake, before or after
the real action.
Indeed, the more “organized” a movement is, the less likely is there
looting. Massive looting occurred in the great strikes of 1877, which, de-
spite—or more likely because of—the lack of strong union leadership,
was the largest wave of industrial action in America in the nineteenth
century. After the general strike of the enslaved, the strikes of 1877 were
the century’s largest insurrectionary movement. Meanwhile, during the
highly organized Seattle General Strike of 1919, a central council literally
mandated that dairies and food stores stay open and continue delivering
for the duration of the strike, forestalling any necessity of looting.*
But the history of looting in the labor movement tells another story,
one in which the unemployed, immigrant, internal migrant, and non-
white masses take direct, decentralized action to usher in a more livable
world. These movements are largely forgotten and poorly documented,
but fragments of the history remain, and in them we can see another way
of imagining workers’ struggles. We see anarchist women at the heads
of thousands of unemployed marchers, urging them to rob bakeries to
feed themselves, and hungry coal miners descending on state capitols
to take whatever they can carry away. Instead of the orderly formation of
dues-paying union members and party cadre, we see how often leftists
“organize” working-class folks already taking their lives and their power
into their own hands. We also see how often those unions and parties,

*Two of the biggest years of industrial action in American history—1877 and 1919—are
also two of the worst years of white supremacist retrenchment and violence in that his-
tory: the end of Reconstruction and the Red Summer. I don’t know quite what to make
of this—a number of contradictory explanations offer themselves—but it seems signifi-
cant and of serious interest for further study.

once established, immediately begin to repress the “unproductive” “anti-
social” activity that gave birth to them, and in the process often cripple
the power of the people they claim to fight for.
By tracing looting and rioting through the Progressive Era and the
Great Depression, therefore, we arrive at a necessarily harsh critique of
unionism and reformism in America. Again and again, the movements
of workers and unemployed persons, immigrants, and internal migrants
were betrayed by trade unions and party organizations. These betrayals
are made more bitter by the fact that the workers themselves demanded,
fought for, and built these organizations and unions to help them usher
in a better world.^1
The classical labor movement, framed by two moments featuring
extensive looting, can reorient our concepts of organization, work, and
struggle: the Great Unrest of 1877 and the unemployed people’s move-
ment during the Great Depression. These two movements existed largely
outside the sweep of “unionism” but are also inextricably linked to the de-
velopment of the trade union movement and its historical understanding.
Looking outside the mainstream union movement is also important
for any history that centers the foundational nature of white supremacy
and heteropatriarchy. For the entirety of the nineteenth century and
much of the twentieth, the vast majority of unions were “whites-only.”
And, despite the massive presence of women in the industrial workforce,
particularly in textiles—although dramatic and inspiring exceptions ex-
ist—most of these parties and unions were staffed and led exclusively
by men. “Disorganized” looting and rioting, however, tended to more
prominently feature immigrants, people of color, and women, both in
the makeup of the crowds and in “leadership” positions.
Furthermore, the last five years has seen the largest upsurge in strikes,
union organization, and other forms of industrial action in the United
States in decades. Though this strike wave has been inspiring, it has also
led to a consensus among parts of the US Left that union organization
(and its accompanying electoralism) is the only significant way forward
for the movement. These narratives already downplay or even erase the
role of the most significant social struggles of the last decade, the Black


126 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

insurrections against the police and Standing Rock and Indigenous land
defense, as they attempt to funnel energy into the sphere of workplace
organization and electoral political gains.
To tell the stories of unions, of “organization” as the story of worker
resistance, therefore, is to leave out the movements, tactics, and goals of
millions of working people, often the most radical, oppressed, and mar-
ginalized of them. The history of looting decenters these working men
without erasing the historical importance of the struggles they fought
in.* If we tell the story of the unruly, riotous masses, and their often
overlapping, sometimes conflictual and contradictory relationship to
“the labor movement” proper, we get a clearer picture of how we might
act in the present to honor and recapture that power without falling into
the same traps that doomed US American working-class movements to
liberal accommodation and repression.

LOOting enters the American English lexicon for the first
time during the struggles of the post-Reconstruction era, when it became
a more present and viable tactic of resistance to the forms of social orga-
nization and economic power of the period. The transformations of the
half century from the end of Reconstruction through the Great Depres-
sion shaped daily life in America into a form we can recognize today. The
ongoing transition from a largely rural, agrarian society to a more urban,
industrial one accelerated dramatically. The Jeffersonian ideal of a na-
tion of small farmer–landowners and self-made men—an ideal always
based in slavery, patriarchy, and colonialism—began to unravel, even for
the white male American citizens it was designed for.

*It is also the case that the history of the labor movement, even that history critiqued
here, goes largely untold in American curriculums, ignored by culture both popular and
elite. Most Americans have a big blank in their historical consciousness regarding the
years between the closing of the Civil War and the opening of World War I, a period
of both massive US imperial expansion and great social upheaval. Hopefully, this cri-
tique will drive people to investigate this incredibly important social era, one that, in the
organization of economic power under increasingly plutocratic monopoly, quite often
reflects our own.

The economy, instead, was increasingly dominated by massive banks
and corporations, with both economic and political power concentrated
in the hands of monopolists and businessmen. The increasing numbers
of European American workers, then, owned nothing but their own la-
bor power. The policeman on the beat emerges in force and becomes
a major figure both in the formation of urban political power and in
the control and repression of proletarian life in the period. Urban gover-
nance, meanwhile, changed from being dominated by more visibly cor-
rupt political machines based in patronage, neighborhood gangs, and
cash handouts to a form more centralized, bureaucratic, and structurally
corrupt. This last transition had as much to do with the formation of the
police as with progressive governmental reform.†
At the same time, an urban middle class emerged, and with it an econ-
omy based on consumerism. Consumerism here means a system in which
the economy, the market, and the worker are all driven by expanding ac-
cess to goods and services. We tend to think of this change as occurring in
the mid-twentieth century, but treatises on consumerism and conspicuous
consumption appear for the first time in America in the 1890s. The avail-
ability of mass-produced commodities takes off in this period.
Production of those commodities was powered by exploitation of
Latin America through imperialist treaty, the growth of American col-
onies in the Caribbean and East Asia, and an expanding base of cheap
laborers within the country’s borders. Massive imperial expansion, mass
immigration from Europe and Asia, and concerted internal migration of
white settlers to the West and Black people out of the South all meant
growing, diverse populations of urban poor crowded into industrial cen-
ters, whose geography in this period was shaped largely by the growth of
the railroad and its hubs.
The increase in industrial goods and the stores in which they were
sold, alongside the concentration of impoverished proletarians in
city centers, meant that daily life began to feature the humiliation of
wealth and luxury taunting poor folks from behind a plane of plate glass.

†As Kristian Williams shows, the centralizing, bureaucratizing transition largely follows
the development of police forces, which are in most cases the first citywide centralized
bureaucracies on which other departments of urban governance are then based.


128 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Though the differences between the poor and the rich have always been
an experience lived more immediately by the poor, the rise of the middle
classes and the appearance of consumer goods and mass-manufactured
commodities gave these differences a new material content and visibility
on city streets. Looting became an immediately sensible response to this
novel state of affairs.
However, if the presence of these industrial goods to loot was new,
looting as a tactic was already well established in its classical form: the
bread riot. This kind of riot, aimed at stealing the food the people needed,
lowering the price of food in the market through direct action, or forcing
official distribution or policy change, is an ancient practice. Bread riots
occurred repeatedly in ancient Rome. They usually worked by rioters
attacking the officials who controlled food policy—during the Roman
republic these were senators and various other wealthy elites, but later
crowds jeered and harassed emperors and other imperial officials—rather
than by looting, though the houses of Roman merchants and landlords
were occasionally ransacked in these movements.
The bread riot was a particularly common feature of early modern
Europe. But the cause of these riots is often treated as a simple correla-
tion: food prices go up, people get hungry, and they then “instinctively”
riot and take whatever food they need to live. Indeed, some economists
explained the uprisings of 2011 as a result of global grain price increase.
As labor historian E. P. Thompson argues, this mechanical view of the
masses simply responding to stimuli, this “crass economic reductionism,”
does not bear out in the record of food rioters’ self-explanation or in the
history of emergent food riots.^2 *
The rate and occurrence of bread riots exploded in the early days
of capitalism, which aimed to drive down the price of bread. As theorist
Joshua Clover argues, this price was reduced literally to zero in the imme-

*Nor, indeed, do such explanations hold in Roman bread riots, which, as Paul Erdkamp
argues, often responded to and were organized against perceived injustices, such as
hoarding corn to artificially raise prices or personal political squabbles in which certain
state actors stopped distributing or importing grain (Paul Erdkamp, “A Starving Mob
Has No Respect: Urban Markets and Food Riots in the Roman World, 100 bc–400 ad,”
in Transformation of Economic Life under the Roman Empire, ed. J. Rich and L. De Blois
[Amsterdam: Gieben, 2002], 93–115).

diate case of looting, but rioters also frequently worked to control prices
in other ways. They would riot to stop ships laden with grain, salt, or meat
from leaving port, because they understood that growing and selling for
export drove the domestic price of food up. Clover calls these “export
riots.” Rather than inchoate expressions of material necessity, bread riots
were often directed political acts, focused on particular villains of the
market, particular modes of price gouging or food quality adulteration.^3
Though bread riots became less frequent as the nineteenth century
progressed, they hardly disappeared. An oft-overlooked event in the Civil
War was the rash of two dozen or so food riots, largely carried out in the
cities of the Confederacy, in the spring of 1863.
Unable to afford the price of food, which increased exponentially
both from the terrible inflation of the Confederate dollar and the massive
supply problems facing both army and civilian organization, thousands
of Southern women rose up and looted the stores of Richmond, Atlanta,
Salisbury, and many smaller cities and towns. Groups of men formed
to watch the action, sometimes egging the women on, but rarely join-
ing in. The looting spread from city to city, where war widows, refugees,
and indigent “camp followers”—polite nineteenth-century language en-
compassing both soldiers’ wives and children and the sex workers who
could also be hired to clean and cook for soldiers on the march—found
themselves increasingly impoverished by the slaveowner’s war. Much as
CNN would today, the Confederate press blamed the riots on outside
agitators, foreigners, and career criminals, though they also called these
rioters Yankees and prostitutes, adding, for extra spice, that these female
rioters were all ugly. Like the draft riots a few months later would be to
the Union, the bread riots of 1863 were both a part and a sign of the col-
lapse of morale on the Confederacy’s home front.^4
As industrial production shifted to occupy a more central role in the
American economy, however, the bread riot receded and the industrial
workplace became an increasingly central site of struggle. The goods pro-
duced there, and the modes of their production and distribution, became
the new objects and scenes of conflict: of strike, riot, and looting.
In the late nineteenth century, these new technologies had a particu-
lar apogee: an industry employing over seven hundred thousand, making


130 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

products fundamentally central to American society, psychology, and
ideology. Much as the internet does today, in the latter decades of the
nineteenth century “the railroad stood for technology in popular rhet-
oric, and Americans endowed technology with qualities they imagined
to be uniquely American: prosperity, mobility and democracy.”^5 * The
Great Unrest of 1877, which saw more than a hundred people killed in
combat with the police and the army, and millions of dollars of value
looted and destroyed, which even briefly saw a Paris Commune–inspired
council take over St. Louis, was sparked by a strike on the railroad.

In most narratives, the American labor movement begins with
the events of the Great Unrest of 1877, a series of strikes and riots that
shook the country to its foundations. Starting here, of course, already
misses the largest struggle against work in American history—the general
strike of the enslaved—as well as the massive battles of Reconstruction.
This myopia emerges from the labor movement itself: “New York in 1871
witnessed a march of 20,000, demonstrating solidarity with the workers
of Paris, 20,000 radicals who were able to look across the ocean to the
Paris Commune but were unable to look five hundred miles to the South
to the South Carolina commune!”^6 From the very beginning white or-
ganizers tended to distance themselves from the projects of emancipa-
tion and Reconstruction, while simultaneously evoking “wage slavery”
as the name of their oppression. This refusal of solidarity and alliance
constantly enfeebled the labor movement and saw labor “radicals” betray
Black people and their struggles again and again.†

*You could replace nineteenth with twenty-first and railroad with internet and the sen-
tence still makes the same sense. The ways in which society is fundamentally unchanged
over the last hundred and fifty years—particularly in meta-narratives of progress, history,
technology, and change—are as numerous and significant as the ways in which it has
changed.
†It does not escape my attention that, by having labor struggles in a separate chapter here,
I do some of that same dividing. My hope is to tell this story of the labor movement in
such a way as to reduce that division.


```

This failure emerged in part, no doubt, from the directly white su-
premacist nature of organized labor up to the moment. Even the most
pro-union histories shy away from the first decades of trade unionism in
America, ignoble years when most organized labor actively positioned
itself against emancipation and agitated in favor of genocidal colonizing
of the West. Through the 1880s, unions were tiny and weak. Wage labor-
ers made up a small percentage of the population; organized laborers, a
small percentage of them.
The Great Unrest, then, a massive, disorganized, multiracial series
of strikes, riots, and uprisings, represented as much a break with the pre-
vious labor movement as a continuation. But its historical size and rel-
evance are usually downplayed, even by historians of labor. A common
position sees the strike of 1877 as “significant primarily because it gave
workingmen a class consciousness on a national scale.”^7 This perspec-
tive makes sense only if we value organization and worker identity as the
fundamental precepts of revolutionary struggle, and it lets us see how
thinking of struggle in those terms blinded previous laborers and even
revolutionaries to the mass movements happening all around them. But
viewed in tandem with the general strike of the enslaved and with Recon-
struction, the Great Unrest looks just as much like an ending: the ending
of a period of revolutionary struggle against wage labor itself and the final
victory of reactionary Northern capital in organizing American society
around industrial production.
The Great Unrest began on July 16, 1877, when the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad (B&O) cut wages by 10 percent, the second such wage cut
in eight months. As workers gathered in frustration in the Martinsburg,
West Virginia, railyard, the crew of a cattle train struck, abandoning their
train and refusing to move it until the pay cut was rescinded. Traffic on
the line was stopped, and other workers refused to replace them.
The next day the state militia arrived and, filling the cattle train with
armed men, tried again to drive it through the yard. A workman named
William Vandergriff ran up to derail the train at a switch, and when the
militia pilot jumped down to oppose him, Vandergriff shot the scab. Van-
dergriff was in turn shot and fatally wounded. But the train crew fled, and


132 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

another could not be gathered. With news of this victory, striking spread
across West Virginia, and across the entire B&O.
Freight traffic was completely stopped, “while the workers contin-
ued to run passenger and mail cars with no interference.”^8 More than
that, sympathetic workers from other industries went out in support of
the strikers, and talk of a general strike began to spread through the state.
Desperate, the governor of West Virginia and the president of B&O
begged President Rutherford B. Hayes for federal troops to suppress what
they were already calling an “insurrection.”
Hayes obliged, but, though the three hundred heavily armed soldiers
he sent managed to finally get trains out of the Martinsburg yard on July
19, four days into the insurrection, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Because in
town after town crowds of railroad men, unemployed workers, sympathy
strikers, and huge groups of women derailed, attacked, and otherwise
sabotaged the scab trains. Where trains from Martinsburg went, strikes
and riots followed, and soon all of neighboring Maryland’s railroads and
much of its industry were also on strike.
One of the most common tactics used in this insurrection was to
overturn, loot, and then burn the freight cars. This had three immedi-
ately powerful effects for the movement: it blocked the lines and the
yards, making them impassable for scab trains; gathered goods and food
to sustain strikers; and cut into the railroad’s bottom line. This tactic
reappeared in the United States in September 2016, when protesters in
Charlotte fighting for justice for Keith Lamont Scott overturned and
looted semi-trucks, turning some of the goods into burning barricades
that blocked the interstate.
Back in 1877, in response to the chaos spreading, the governor of
Maryland called out the National Guard. But the residents of Baltimore,
where the guard was stationed, rioted, attacking the guardsmen with
stones and brickbats and preventing them from boarding trains to go to
break the strike. Exasperated, the governor begged for a full federal in-
tervention. It was at this moment that Pittsburgh and St. Louis exploded
into insurrection.
How did strikes, rioting, and looting spread so widely and so quickly?
After all, barely any of these workers were organized into a national

```
union. In fact, as labor historian Jeremy Brecher argues, the Great Unrest
occurred in the wake of unionism’s repeated failures to win change. The
Panic of 1873, one of the most severe depressions in American history,
saw unemployment skyrocket. As ever, capitalists used the downturn as
grounds to cut wages and enforce speedups. But the organizations that
existed, the various “Brotherhoods” (of firemen, engineers, and conduc-
tors), had been bought off, out-politicked, or frightened out of striking.
They agreed, against the rank and file’s wishes, to speedups and pay cuts.
Their membership plummeted and many of the unions ceased to exist
except on paper.
In the wake of their failure, a clandestine insurrectionary organization
formed, the Trainsmen’s Union, and spread quickly across the country.
But the Trainsmen’s Union was just as quickly infiltrated by feds, police,
and Pinkerton thugs—the infamous private police force that spied on and
sabotaged the labor movement and that was often called in to violently
break strikes—such that in the buildup to any actions mass firings of
radicals and organizers would lead to confusion and disunity within the
movement. Soon the TU collapsed as well. Union membership was at a
decades-long low when things kicked off in Martinsburg. Furthermore,
for one of the last times in American labor history, forming or protecting
a union would not be a major demand of the struggle.^9
The rioters of 1877 had a different political precedent and goal in
mind: the Paris Commune of 1871. As Nell Irvin Painter shows in her
seminal Standing at Armageddon, the Commune was a common point
of reference for rioters, and their critics, across the country. US workers
fought to take control of their daily lives, their local and workplace gover-
nance in much the same way that the Communards had for seventy-one
glorious days in 1871. And conservatives and liberals alike feared that
French revolt and class war had finally crossed the Atlantic.
In St. Louis, during one week, a strike that started against wage cuts
in the railyards generalized and eventually completely shut down the
city. Political power moved into the hands of a commune made up of

. . . whoever showed up. It was run, like the Paris Commune, on genu-
inely radical antihierarchical principles. “Nobody ever knew who that
executive committee really was; it seems to have been a rather loose


134 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

body composed of whomsoever chanced to come in and take part in
its deliberations.”^10 This “disorganized” assembly managed commerce in
the city, halted all railroad traffic, and requisitioned food for strikers—
whose numbers encompassed more than a dozen professions outside of
the rails, constituting an almost total general strike. But after eight days,
three thousand federal troops and five thousand deputized police offi-
cers descended on the city, killed more than two dozen people, and shut
down the commune.
This lack of official organization and union leadership also meant
that Black workers were widely involved in the Great Upheaval. In the
border states, Black and white workers banded together to shut down
roads and coal mines. A Black worker, his name unknown to history,
made one of the crucial speeches opening the St. Louis General Strike
with a demand to white laborers to support Black steamboat and levee
workers. “Will you stand behind us regardless of color?!” Black workers
ran the movements in the South, leading particularly massive strikes in
Galveston and Marshall, Texas. Black sewer workers in Louisville, Ken-
tucky, marched through the sewers and then the city, beginning a three-
day-long general strike that brought all industry in Louisville to a halt.
The response was more than just immediate violent repression on the
parts of the guard and the police: the national media built a narrative of
a menacing and dangerous working class. Although there wasn’t a full-
blown Red Scare, 1877 was one of the first times American papers and
capitalists talked about and feared communists. Of particular portent was
the insurrectionary rioting in Pittsburgh.
The rioting in the industrial city in western Pennsylvania followed
a couple of days of striking on the railroad. Sent in to repress the strike,
local national guardsmen instead fraternized with strikers, and police
were unable to break the strike, which left thousands of full boxcars sit-
ting idle in the Pittsburgh yards. The railroads, panicked by the thought
of all that property and profit languishing, brought in national guards-
men from Philadelphia, knowing they wouldn’t hesitate to fire on the
working men. These outside agitators promptly did their bosses’ bidding,
massacring twenty strikers. They even brought a Gatling gun to mow
down rioters.


```
Looted Bread, Stolen Labor 135
```
But the massacre backfired. Though the company technically retook
the yards, no one, not even those workers who hadn’t originally gone on
strike, would drive trains captured in such blood. The entire Pittsburgh
guard switched allegiance to the side of the workers, giving over their
weapons to the workers, and in response to the capture of the rail depot
“the entire city mobilized.” A massive crowd formed and attacked the
yards, forcing the Philadelphia National Guard to flee. Having driven
away the guard, the crowd broke into and looted all of the freight cars
left in the yard. Then they burned them, alongside all railroad property,
letting the fire devour huge swaths of railroad and capitalist property,
but organizing fire breaks to prevent the conflagration from spreading to
nearby residential areas. This tactic of controlled arson would return in
the major urban riots of the sixties and in LA in 1992.
By the time the various riots, strikes, and insurrections had been
quelled by repression, over a hundred lay dead and millions of dollars in
property had been looted and destroyed. In some cities and workplaces,
demands were met; in many they were not. But the looting and property
destruction terrified owners and government officials alike. Led by Penn-
sylvania Railroad president Thomas A. Scott, who had lost tremendous
wealth in Pittsburgh, a movement grew among capitalists to reinforce
urban defenses against their new working-class enemies and the revo-
lution their mass riots pointed toward. And so it was in response to the
property destruction, looting, armed rebellion, and general strikes of 1877
that almost every city in America built a huge armory to garrison weapons
and guardsmen—buildings that remain to this day, massive monuments
to anticommunal politics and glaring symbols of the bosses’ power over
daily life. And though these armories are now mostly decommissioned,
when riots get too powerful for police to handle, it is still the National
Guard, armed to the teeth, that is called in to face down rebels.*

*Painter compares these armories to the Haussmannization of Paris in which the French
government ripped up neighborhoods of small, winding streets and replaced them with
massive boulevards that ran through the heart of Paris, enabling French troops to move
unencumbered and making barricades and rioters less effective.


136 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

From here, labor histories leapfrog through the decades
from major flash point to flash point, tracing the ebb and flow of union
membership and class consciousness, as the labor movement marches
toward its supposed apotheosis in the sit-down strikes of the thirties, the
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and the New Deal.
These histories trace how the tradition of craft unions gives way,
slowly and painfully, to industrial unionism.* There’s the eight-hour
movement, bursting onto the scene in a furious wave of strike and orga-
nizing activity in 1885–1886, culminating in a general strike in Chicago
and ending in infamy with the Haymarket bombing, the execution of
four anarchists for a bombing they did not commit, and the creation of
May Day. This movement is often told in tandem with the story of the
Knights of Labor, a cautious and conservative organization that, as a fluke
of a strike victory in 1885 by a radical local over notoriously antilabor steel
baron Jay Gould, suddenly became the largest mass worker organization
in American history. Its effectiveness emerges largely from the fact that it
was necessarily decentralized, having grown too large too fast for its an-
tistrike, antiaction “Grand Master Workman” Terrence Powderly to han-
dle, despite literal attempts on his part to stop and to sabotage the strike
wave, to have effective repressive control.
But in the aftermath, the K of L faded, as the AFL, the American Fed-
eration of Labor, took its place at the center of the labor story. The AFL,
organized on craft principles and run by the hardnosed, racist, antistrike

*Craft unionism is a model that emerged from the nineteenth-century conditions of
labor, organizing workers on the basis of their particular job in the shop (so that one
railroad workforce might be split into fifteen different unions based on their job and level
of skill) and negotiating separately with the bosses for craft-based wage scales and hours.
Craft unions often represented a conservative or reactionary brake on the movement,
because the highest paid and highest skilled workers’ unions could often be bought out
by getting a good contract from the boss, getting workers back to work, and effectively
breaking a strike. This played right into the hands of capital as industrialization increas-
ingly deskilled the workforce, leaving tiny pools of well-paid conservative skilled work-
ers—sometimes referred to as the “aristocracy of labor.” As immigration increased, craft
unions overwhelmingly became nativist white organizations of labor aristocrats, often
explicitly racist and anti-immigrant, more allied with the foremen and bosses than the
general laborers. Industrial unionism is the basis of organization by industry so that ev-
eryone who works on the railroad or in steel can join the same union, and it has become
the dominant mode of unionism since the thirties.

Samuel Gompers, dominated official labor politics until the 1930s, and
everywhere militancy and insurrection appeared, the AFL attempted to
tamp it down. Still, AFL locals were often at the heart of strikes through-
out the period: the AFL was, often, the only game in town, much to the
detriment of the strikes and struggles it came to represent. In 1892, the
bitter lockout at the Carnegie-owned, Jay Gould–managed Homestead
Steel Works in Pennsylvania would see AFL-affiliated mill workers en-
gage in and win a gun battle with a barge full of Pinkertons, who had
sailed up the Monongahela River to break the workers’ siege on the mill.
In 1892, a multiracial general strike also shut down New Orleans.
An even more violent and drastic struggle broke out in 1894, as more-
or-less military conflicts raged between strikers and strikebreakers and
militias in the coal mines, with strike action reaching from Pennsylvania
all the way to Colorado. Miners, who lived in utterly desperate poverty in
isolated rural communities owned and managed by the coal conglomer-
ates, banded together not just to fight but also to loot company stores and
groceries to keep the strike going, as they would again in West Virginia
during the infamous mine wars of 1912–1921.
The year 1894 was also when the famous Pullman Strike, a mass
boycott- cum-strike on the railroads led by Eugene Debs’s American Rail-
way Union (ARU), “rapidly came to be understood as a general struggle
between all workers and corporations as a whole.”^11 The ARU exploded
in membership and power, and the strike spread across the rail lines
that Pullman cars traveled. US president Grover Cleveland sent federal
troops into Chicago, the heart of the strike, to break it, but this backfired
disastrously, as mobs of working-class people, most not strikers, formed
to fight off federal troops, loot, riot, and burn. This conflict turned the
movement into a massive upheaval that spread even more broadly across
the country, as rail traffic almost completely collapsed, particularly west
of the Appalachians. The working class was ready to fight.
But here again the leadership failed the workers. First, the associated
AFL unions, meeting in an emergency conference, rejected the demand
of the rank and file to call an official sympathetic general strike and in-
stead ordered workers back into their shops. Then, with the ARU isolated
by their compatriots and the militia, the leadership balked.


138 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

```
When the troops came in, making legal success impossible, workers
throughout the country responded with mass direct action. But for
the ARU to adopt such a policy would have meant a challenge to the
entire social order—a step from which it recoiled. Thus we are pre-
sented with the spectacle of Eugene Victor Debs, perhaps the great-
est example of a courageous, radical and incorruptible trade union
official in American history, trying to end the strike to prevent it from
becoming an insurrection.^12
```
Thus, even in this moment of mass action, with the most radical
available leader at the helm, the union failed its membership and folded.
If the required next step is generalizing and socializing the revolt, and
therefore, giving up control, legitimacy, or negotiating powers, a union
will always choose to abandon a fight, even if the fight, and the revolt
it emerged from or helped create, is the very basis of the union and its
power. The logic of formal organizational power, no matter how noble or
radical the organizations’ goals, will in crisis lead it to preserve itself for
“the next fight” rather than abandon it all for this one.
But the organization that is preserved is one that, at the height of the
people’s power, turned its back on them, and the people do not forget
these betrayals. The organization will never again achieve the leverage it
had during the conflict—in other words, the organization doomed itself
all the same to collapse and crisis, though a slower, more protracted, and
ambiguous one.

Labor struggles continued throughout the period. One of
their greatest heights during the first decade of the 1900s came when
the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or Wobblies, the syndicalist
union that organized across gender and racial lines to join all the working
class into “one big union” for revolutionary social transformation, won
strikes, fights for free speech and freedom of assembly, and other battles
across the country. Much as Antifa has become the modern-day reaction-
ary boogeyman, for decades during the early twentieth century no insult


```
Looted Bread, Stolen Labor 139
```
was worse than being called a Wobbly (or sometimes “an IWW”), and for
many being a Wob led to arrest, torture, tarring and feathering, and even
lynching.
But it wasn’t just violent repression that held back workers. The gath-
ering storm of world war complicated the trajectory of the labor move-
ment. Although US antiwar sentiment prevailed for the first year of the
interimperial European conflict, war fever was growing, and gradually so-
cialists, trade unionists, and liberals alike unified to support the allied fight
“over there.” The continued outspoken and principled antimilitarism of
the Wobblies and anarchists, which was a common enough position in
1914–1915, led to their marginalization and even criminalization as traitors.
Still, as war production ramped up in 1916 and with the young men
of the working class vacuumed into the war machine via enlistment, big
transformations took place in the makeup of the industrial workforce as
women moved into men’s industries and Black Southerners came into
Northern industrial centers as part of the Great Migration. Labor agita-
tion again increased.
News of the Russian Revolution lent a new vigor to the radical move-
ment, and the October victory of the Bolsheviks meant the Wobbly and
the anarchist were joined and soon replaced in the fevered minds of the
foaming-mouthed patriots by the Red, the bolshie, the communist. And
with the German Revolution of 1918, it seemed the victory of radical la-
bor was inexorable.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, in the year 1919, a huge strike
wave spread across the country, the largest since 1877, including a gen-
eral strike that completely shut down Seattle. But the year also saw the
country’s first bona fide “Red Scare,” as anarchists, labor organizers,
communists, and socialists of all stripes were rounded up, imprisoned,
and deported by federal Attorney General Palmer and his goons. Reac-
tionary mobs of veterans rioted to attack socialist demonstrations; destroy
union and Wobbly halls, presses, and infrastructure; and beat, maim, or
murder organizers. The conservatives in the AFL, meanwhile, used the
Red Scare to purge what socialists and militants remained in their ranks.
As we’ve seen above, 1919 also featured the highest number of anti-
Black riots in American history, and the early twenties was a time of


140 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

dramatic reactionary retrenchment as anticommunism and anti-Black
sentiments merged into a molten stew of violence and hatred, embodied
in the dramatic return of the KKK.
But despite the turmoil in the early years of the century, the twenties
were widely seen as a time of social and industrial peace and prosper-
ity—though that prosperity was being bought on credit, and the working
class would soon be paying the bill. As ever, “social peace” just means the
rich were winning the class war without much fight back, exploiting the
workers in new, disruptive, innovative ways.
After fifty years of relatively constant social and class struggle, a new
affluence seemed to have finally solved the “labor question,” and busi-
nessmen and union heads alike celebrated a “New Unionism” free of
strikes in which union bosses hashed out contracts with owners over
Chamber of Commerce luncheons. As part of this union conservatism
and “respectability,” unions leaned into their role as the official arbiters
of the color line in Northern labor. The Black workers who had moved
north during war production were once again violently relegated, by boss
and union alike, to an enforced status as unskilled, disposable labor.
The Roaring Twenties are associated with profligate wealth and con-
sumption—and indeed, consumer goods spread rapidly, although, much
like ownership of smartphones or flatscreens today, this did not reflect
actual wealth or power. Wages stagnated through the decade and pov-
erty deepened for millions alongside this increased access to consumer
goods.* The twenties are also famous for their organized crime syndicates
of bootleggers fighting the G-Men of Prohibition. Less well remembered
is that those criminal syndicates built their model and got “organized”
as part of labor “rackets” that used violence—“slugging,” fire bombing,
even assassination—to enforce control of a local employment space.
Though these hired criminals began as off-the-books employees of
the union, as unions increasingly followed the AFL lead and shied away
from collective action, striking, and industrial unionism, they lost all
leverage beyond this professional violence. Unions came to rely on it

*Indeed, the invention of consumer debt through purchase by installment and (usually
disastrous) popular entry into stock and bond speculation kept the party going for a while.

more and more. Gangsters quickly realized they were the true political
power: they were running labor in whole industries, even whole cities—
with the unions paying them and at their mercy—and from that position
of organization and power, they extended into “protection” and other of
their more infamous criminal activities.^13

The New Deal is celebrated by liberals and progressives as
the pinnacle of good governance, held up as the model for large-scale,
government-backed actions in response to crises, from health care to
climate change. But the New Deal was in fact one of the greatest innova-
tions in counterrevolutionary statecraft in American history. A response
to the threat of communism and Black revolt, it funneled the anger
and activity of a massive movement into charity, unionism, work, and
electoral politics, fully embedding racist divisions of welfare and public
action in federal relief structures. FDR quite possibly staved off the for-
mation of a real revolutionary rupture and set the terms of liberal dom-
ination of the poor for the next fifty years—particularly by structuring
federal relief in fundamentally anti-Black but technically “color-blind”
ways—all, crucially, without significantly improving the conditions on
the ground.
Because when the bottom fell out, it fell very far. Within twelve
months of the Black Tuesday crash of October 1929, the official count of
the unemployed went from around five hundred thousand to eight mil-
lion people (though these numbers themselves are probably low, because
the unemployment count was one of the demands won by the move-
ment, so unemployed persons weren’t reliably counted until after 1929).
The unemployed in America faced a crisis exacerbated by an American
ideology that rejected and minimized social services, pushing most relief
onto churches and other private charities; an utterly unprepared and fun-
damentally unsympathetic federal government; and a plutocratic gang of
billionaire monopolists who uttered patriotic pieties and predictions of
imminent economic recovery while laying off tens of thousands of work-
ers. The people were, as ever, on their own.


142 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

One of the first things that occurred, spontaneously and across the
country, was looting. Numerous contemporaneous accounts agree that
mass looting was commonplace around the nation, but its extent will
never be known. Mauritz Hallgren’s Seeds of Revolt, published in 1933,
describes the pattern in Detroit, in 1932, and explains why it is so little
remembered by history:

```
Windows of small retail shops were smashed at night and relieved
of their goods. Children from the poorer districts were frequently
observed snatching bundles from customers coming out of grocery
stores. They ran off to barren homes with their booty or ate it them-
selves in out-of-the-way alleys. More frequently, grown men, usually
in twos and threes, entered chain stores, ordered all the food they
could possibly carry, and then walked quietly out without paying.
Every newspaper in the city knew of this practice and knew it was
spreading, but none mentioned it to print. The press excused itself on
the ground that these occurrences were not a matter of public record.
And the chain-store managers refused to report such incidents to the
police lest the practice be encouraged by the resultant publicity.^14
```
In New York, “bands of thirty or forty men regularly descended upon
markets.”^15 The scope of this organized, spontaneous looting has largely,
therefore, been lost to history. However, we must imagine that looting
kept not a few people alive during these tragic years. And it wasn’t only
grocery stores. “In a few cities . . . there were spontaneous raids on restau-
rants.”^16 This looting was not always done in small groups.
The unemployed movement took shape in a recognizably national
form around the March 6, 1930, “International Employment Day”
demonstrations. These demonstrations shocked even their Communist
Party organizers in their size and ferocity, with the CP claiming 1.25 mil-
lion people protested across the country on the sixth. Immediate, mass,
violent repression sprang up: hundreds of policemen charged into the
crowd, viciously beating dozens and shattering the demonstration in
New York City’s Union Square.


```
Looted Bread, Stolen Labor 143
```
But the repression did not break the back of the movement. Huge
marches and riots of unemployed workers became a regular occurrence
across the country. They demanded work, relief, and bread; just as often,
they took it. “In March, 1,100 men waiting on a Salvation Army bread line
in New York City mobbed two trucks delivering baked goods to a nearby
hotel.” Although riots and marches like these were more common in the
large cities of the North where workers were concentrated, they were not
limited to them. “In Henryetta, Oklahoma, 300 jobless marched on store-
keepers to demand food, insisting they were not begging and threatening
to use force if necessary.”^17 Hallgren describes a scene in West Virginia:

```
Fifteen hundred miners, together with their wives and children,
marched upon Charleston . . . in May 1931. They came from the Ward
district to demand help from the government. Governor Conley met
them at the edge of the city, explained that the state could do noth-
ing for them, and gave them ten dollars out of his own pocket—ten
dollars to be divided among fifteen hundred hungry people. Frank
Keeney, the leader of the protesting miners, flared up in anger .  . .
to his followers, as they marched on into the city, [Keeney] said: “All
that stands between you hungry people and food are a few plate glass
windows; no state has a right to call you criminal if you take what you
must have to live.”^18
```
The logic of property, in the face of starvation and mass unemploy-
ment, was breaking down, perhaps not as easily as a pane of plate glass,
but surely and steadily. And as the logic of property breaks down, so too
must the logic of race. After five decades of labor struggles that quite
often reinforced rather than challenged the white supremacist order of
the workplace, the unemployed movement was openly multiracial, led
by and often made up of Black militants and, in most places, opposed by
and to the anticommunist and racial terror politics that had resurfaced so
openly in the twenties. Many of the Unemployed Councils that sprang
up were interracial and often were the first interracial organizations to ap-
pear in their areas.^19 Where property teeters, so too does white supremacy.


144 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

This spread to the question of housing, as rent and anti-eviction ri-
ots became one of the most common forms of resistance to Depression
conditions. Groups of unemployed people, usually Black activists, often
Communists, formed anti-eviction flying squadrons.^20 These squadrons,
sometimes called “black bugs,” would march through poor neighbor-
hoods gathering crowds, then arrive at the eviction, often thousands
strong, replace furniture inside the house and forcibly keep the marshal
from carrying out the eviction. “Sometimes the flying squadrons arrived
before the police, and directed the family and bystanders to sit on the
furniture to prevent its removal. An old spiritual ‘I shall not be moved’
became the theme song of resistance.”^21
This movement was widespread, and wildly successful. The unem-
ployed movement stopped or reversed literally one-third of the evictions
in New York—seventy-seven thousand households!—during the early
thirties. When a rent riot in Chicago ended with three Black people
killed by police, the fierce, combative funeral march the following day
saw unified crowds of Black and white protesters, which terrified the city
government. “If it had been an out-and-out race riot it would have been
understandable, but here was something new: Negroes and whites to-
gether rioting against the forces of law and order.”^22 Chicago City Hall
declared a moratorium on evictions. By 1931, the movement had more or
less ceased evictions in Detroit as well.
These tactics soon broadened to demanding relief and welfare, as
thousands of poor and unemployed people would descend on city halls
and state houses, relief agencies, charities, and anywhere else demands
could be leveraged. Often, these marchers then stationed themselves in-
side the offices, refusing to leave until relief was given and further plans
made. They won radical expansions of relief, and, where they couldn’t,
they often just looted what they needed.
One of the great strengths of the early unemployed movement was
the energy and dedication of Communist Party organizers. In most urban
centers, Communist militants formed the backbone of the early move-
ment, with the party-organized “Unemployed Councils” the nuclei of
the movement wherever they popped up. The organizers that remained
in the CP by 1930, who had survived splits, purges, and Red Scares, were


```
Looted Bread, Stolen Labor 145
```
a hardened and experienced cohort. Shortly to be mobilizing in the de-
fense of the Scottsboro Boys, the CP of 1930 was a multiracial and strongly
antiracist party. Whereas movements in the twenties had distanced them-
selves from Communist organizers, in the misery of the Depression, com-
munism didn’t seem so scary, and evictions were often met with cries to
“call the reds!” In the early years of the movement, Communist militants
were invaluable champions of the fight, supporting neighborhood de-
mands and politicizing the need for relief.
But the energetic and hard work of Communist militants on the
ground often conflicted with the demands of the Party and the Commu-
nist International. “Few unemployed saw the connection between their
immediate need for relief and demonstrations against the ‘Imperialist war
danger,’ slogans about defense of the Chinese Soviets, or even electoral
campaigns for CP candidates. Nor was it clear .  . . why Socialists and
Musteites were regularly labeled ‘social fascists’ and ‘tools of the bosses.’

. . . [This posturing] seriously handicapped efforts to recruit the jobless
into the radical movement.”^23
    This alienating propaganda, however, was less disastrous for the
unemployed than were the organizational imperatives of the Commu-
nist Party. Sharp changes of strategic direction from above often left
local movements whiplashed and reeling. For example, the decision
that organizing mutual aid charity was an “open right-wing opportunist
deviation” in mid-1931 cut the legs out from a few local groups. And
the spontaneous and uncontrollable looting and rioting, unresponsive
to party discipline or strategy, quickly became anathema to the CP.
Although early on councils participated in this rioting, once the party
developed an official position in 1931, many of its organizers worked
hard to stop this tactic. “Unemployed Council leader Herbert Ben-
jamin recalls that ‘those of us who were more politically responsible’
continually advised against food riots, and he believes that more such
rioting would have occurred without the Unemployed Councils. ‘It
seems probable,’ conclude two academic writers unsympathetic to the
Left, ‘that the Communist Party exercised an important influence in
restricting the amount of violence against persons and property during
the depression.’”^24


146 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

This is the kind of achievement that only an organizer could love,
because it demonstrates nothing so much as their gaining social power
against and over the spontaneous needs and desires of the people. It cer-
tainly didn’t help strengthen the movement.
Such repression of local mutual aid and direct action, in fact, played
right into the hands of the liberals of the new Roosevelt administration.
Elected in the largest landslide since Abraham Lincoln’s reelection in
1864, FDR came in promising jobs and relief, a New Deal, and set about
doing . . . a little bit. The jobs and relief programs that came from the
federal government were far too little to stem the economic crisis, but
they were hardly too late. Indeed, they were right on time to disorient the
movement—the money and relief programs the New Deal distributed
were not only too small but also left to states and localities to distribute.
Without strong federal enforcement mechanisms, organizers and the
needy quickly found themselves locked into protracted battles with local
bureaucracies over money and jobs that were anyway inadequate to the
size of the problem.
The same thing was happening to those lucky enough to be employed,
who, with the official legalization of collective bargaining through the
National Recovery Administration (NRA), flocked into unions at an as-
tonishing rate. Those unions were mostly affiliated with the AFL, and
these workers quickly found that the law meant little if the boss had more
power than the workers. By 1935, workers were referring to the NRA as
the “National Run-Around,” and the explosion of union membership
did little but inflate the wallets of conservative union bosses and funnel
subversive energy into official bureaucratic channels. It would take an-
other round of massive upheaval, this one against both the bosses and
the will of the union leadership—the wildcat Sit-Down Strike wave of
1936–1937—to truly bring change to industrial conditions.*

*And here, too, the new unions formed, organized into the CIO, and were co-opted,
legalized, and negotiated with by FDR and his New Deal. Whereas many of the gains
made by the sit-down wave would last longer than those made by the unemployment
movement, both times worker power was undercut as energy funneled into official
movement organs.


```
Looted Bread, Stolen Labor 147
```
It is precisely this sort of mass liberal co-option and diversion of energy
that organizers, as politicized “strategists,” are meant to be best positioned
to resist. But the unemployed organizers were busy trying to unify and
form a national council that could wield “real power.” Frustrated with
the “looseness” of the early councils, they wanted stronger organizations.
Organizers of all socialist tendencies “shared the view that the victories
won by the unemployed in the early Depression were mere handouts.
A significant political movement capable of winning major victories de-
pended, they thought, on firmly structured local and state organizations
knit together in a national body and with a national program.”^25
This shared perspective, that real power flows from unified orga-
nizations, helped the organizers destroy the very power they wanted to
expand.

```
While the leaders of the unemployed groups had been concentrat-
ing on forming a national organization complete with a constitution
and a bureaucratic structure, the local groups across the country were
declining. They were declining largely as a result of the Roosevelt
Administration’s more liberal relief machinery, which diverted local
groups from disruptive tactics and absorbed local leaders in bureau-
cratic roles. And once the movement weakened, and the instability of
which it was one expression subsided, relief was cut back. That this
happened speaks mainly to the resiliency of the American political
system. That it happened so quickly, however, and at so cheap a price,
speaks to the role played by leaders of the unemployed themselves.^26
```
Organizers’ visions of what an actual political organization looked
like played straight into the hands of liberal recuperation, and what tem-
porary gains the movement achieved with direct action were misunder-
stood by organizers as the sign to form a “real” movement. In doing so,
they repressed the direct actions, leaving those gains vulnerable to im-
mediate cut back as local power collapsed. They also left the historical
narrative in the hands of FDR and his New Deal, which did nothing
more than strangle a revolutionary movement in its cradle but which is


148 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

now remembered as having saved the poor of the Great Depression. We
can’t afford to repeat those mistakes.

By centering looting, and seeing its frequent sidelining, re-
jection, or even repression by the organizers, historians, and bureaucrats
of the labor movement, I hope we can begin to shake loose certain con-
ceptions of what revolutionary activity can and must look like to succeed.
Meeting the needs and desires of the proletarian, the worker, the un-
employed, and the downtrodden through direct struggle is not a mistake
or a deviation from the real fight. It is not a failure that must be corrected
by a militant, nor an opportunity to be seized by an organizer. It is the
thing itself, the new world opening up, however briefly, in all its chaotic
frenzy. It is uncontrollable, and as long as those who fight for freedom
fear that uncontrollability, as long as they measure their success by their
ability to direct, to dictate, to marshal, and to focus, they will never be
able to achieve the liberation they seek. They must allow the real move-
ment to change them, or they can only live to see themselves become its
enemy.

chapter six (^) | NO SUCH THING AS NONVIOLENCE
I
n the four hundred years of barbaric, white supremacist, co-
lonial, and genocidal history known as the United States, the civil rights
movement stands out as a bright, beautiful, all-too-brief moment of hope
and struggle. We still live in the shadow of the leaders, theory, and im-
ages that emerged from those years, and any struggle in America that
overlooks the work (both philosophical and organizational) produced in
those decades does so at its own peril. However, why is it drilled into our
heads, from grade school onward, in every single venue, by presidents,
professors, and police chiefs alike, that the civil rights movement was
victorious because it was nonviolent? Surely, we should be suspicious of
any narrative that the entire white establishment agrees is of the utmost
importance.
It is an appealingly simple narrative: in the fifties and sixties there
was the good, successful, nonviolent civil rights movement in the South,
which in the late sixties and early seventies gave way to a misguided,
violent northern Black Power aftermath. This myth shapes not only our
understanding of that period but also our perspectives on modern so-
cial movement activity in America. The division between nonviolence
and militancy—the former moral, normative, and widely supported,


150 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

embodied by Martin Luther King Jr. and the March on Washington,
the latter unpopular, macho, and adventurist, represented by Malcolm X
and the Black Panthers—did not exist until that period, but it has been
used to attack and divide every movement since.
When police and politicians claim that it is nonviolent protesters that
they listen to and protect, they are using this myth against our move-
ments. It is why liberals, in the face of looting and rioting, share memes
about what protesting used to look like featuring picket lines of civil
rights activists, claiming that they would support that kind of protest. (At
the time, of course, even that kind of protest was unpopular among white
liberals, and Martin Luther King Jr. called out the white moderate as the
“great stumbling block” to freedom.)
Though this myth is based on selective historical truths, the broader
narrative is entirely false. To start with, there was no straightforwardly
nonviolent civil rights movement. Nonviolence was a tactic designed at
the time to appeal to Northern white liberals for funding and support.
Nonviolence proved itself effective in desegregating certain public facili-
ties, particularly with the student lunch counter sit-ins that spread across
the South in 1960. Throughout the fifties and sixties, however, away from
the cameras, demonstrators and organizers armed themselves. Idealistic,
nonviolence-trained Freedom Riders were guarded where they worked,
lived, and slept by local people with guns, sometimes over their objec-
tions. One of the most significant struggles in the whole nonviolent pan-
theon, the Birmingham, Alabama, desegregation movement, went from
disciplined nonviolence to decidedly not-nonviolent rioting, with local
teens throwing rocks and attacking property and police in its final victori-
ous days. The very image of disciplined, philosophical nonviolence, Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. traveled with a heavily armed entourage. His home
was protected by armed guards, and one visitor described the inside as
“an arsenal.” Guns were a crucial part of the freedom movement.
But what exactly was that movement? Although we learn about it
in school as the series of struggles that achieved mass recognition—the
Montgomery bus boycott, Little Rock, student sit-ins, Freedom Rides,
Birmingham, the March on Washington, the Mississippi Freedom Dem-
ocratic Party, Selma—the civil rights movement is better understood as


```
No Such Thing as Nonviolence 151
```
the culmination of hundreds of local struggles against white supremacy,
struggles large and small, across the entire country, unfolding across de-
cades. These local movements shared some infrastructure, ideology, and
tactics but had different histories, strategies (including rioting), goals,
and results.
Nor was the Black Freedom movement predominantly driven by
changes in federal law—Brown v. Board, the Civil Rights Act, and so
forth—or by male ministers at the helms of a series of acronymned na-
tional civil rights organizations. Organizational histories, legal narratives,
and leadership biographies are easier to write, to research, and to tell than
the real, messy, grassroots history of social movements: they leave a paper
trail and a clear subject to focus on. Rather than the resulting action of
following orders from on high, however, social movements were usually
organized through direct democratic mass meetings, enabling the grass
roots to keep or wrench power from the big-name leaders. Those na-
tional leaders generally brought more media attention and fundraising
opportunities than actual organizational strength. The majority of move-
ment work was done by local people, joined in struggle and facilitated by
young, idealistic student activists and experienced Black women organiz-
ers like Septima Clark, Ella Baker, and Jo Ann Robinson.^1
Also, there is no clean historical break between the civil rights era
and the era of Black Power. People practiced armed self-defense, orga-
nized around economic autonomy, and fought for Black community
control—perhaps the core tenets of Black Power—throughout the years
when nonviolent direct action was at its height of renown.
Similarly, Black Power and militant resistance cannot be simply
reduced to Malcolm X, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Com-
mittee, and the Black Panther Party, important though they all are. As
Jeanne Theoharis and Komozi Woodard argue, the ideologies of self-
defense, pan-Africanism, socialism, and independent Black political ac-
tion all emerged from grassroots struggles. The leaders did not invent the
rhetoric, ideology, and tactics of Black Power but merely gave effective
expression to them, as police and government commissions consistently
discovered when they tried to find the instigators and conspirators behind
urban uprisings. Hardly limited to the urban North, Black Power also


152 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

wasn’t predominantly a nationalist movement: it had an avowedly antico-
lonial and internationalist perspective, connecting its actions in solidarity
and direct alliance with Third World liberation movements.
Black Power, in other words, was a popular grassroots movement
built in both small-scale local organizing and massive rebellions. The
riots in Watts (1965) and Newark and Detroit (1967) are the most famous
uprisings, but such urban rebellions by no means only occurred in the
North; they spread across the entire country in dozens of major riots and
hundreds of smaller ones. Between 1964 and 1971, 750 Black riots and
rebellions took place in the United States. Rioting and looting were not
accidental offshoots of the Black Freedom movement, not some “oppor-
tunistic” or “tragic” consequence of civil rights struggle. Instead, they
formed a central part of the movement’s power and effectiveness and a
core experience of the movement for many of those who rose up against
white supremacy.
And finally, and most tragically, is the myth that the civil rights move-
ment succeeded. It is often told that the fall of Jim Crow, the granting
of the vote, and the destruction of openly racist laws via federal action,
through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and
the Fair Housing Act of 1968, achieved the core goals of the civil rights
movement.
From the start, the civil rights movement was about much more than
the right to vote and the end of segregation—it always centered economic
justice, freedom from violence, and communal autonomy. The move-
ment’s spark wasn’t the Montgomery bus boycott against segregation in
December 1955 but the national reaction to the lynching of Emmett Till
that August: safety from white violence preceded integration as a concern
of the movement.
As Robin D. G. Kelley argues, this radical and broadly focused move-
ment was “defeated on the shoals of race and property by liberals and
neoliberals” who co-opted and redefined the struggle into terms that did
not threaten their class position.^2 Even as it was unfolding, the media,
the government, moderate organizations, and white supporters worked
to make it appear that desegregation and voting rights were the only de-


```
No Such Thing as Nonviolence 153
```
mands of the movement, just as they worked to make nonviolence seem
like the only viable tactic.
Furthermore, the end of segregation laws did not mean the end of
segregation. American public schools—perhaps the most important ter-
rain of integration struggles—are more segregated now than they were in
the 1970s. Cities are slightly less segregated racially, but class-based urban
segregation is more intense now than it has ever been, a circumstance that
can perhaps be explained by the postmovement admittance of a small,
nonwhite wing to the middle and upper classes. And the overturning
of key parts of the Voting Rights Act, the disenfranchisement of felons,
mass incarceration, gerrymandering, and the various other forms of voter
suppression have meant that even that most basic victory—voting rights
for all—may have been achieved in law but has remained sufficiently
nonexistent in practice to put Donald Trump in the White House. Just
as suppression of Black voters kept the Democrats empowered in the
post-Reconstruction South, so does it keep the Republicans viable today.
The history of the Black Freedom struggle, alongside the histories
of the associated and sometimes overlapping feminist, American Indian,
Chicanx, Asian American, Puerto Rican, disability, queer liberation, and
antiwar movements, has been mythologized and mystified. This mystifi-
cation serves in the present day to divide us in our movements. It keeps
those willing to follow the credo “by any means necessary” isolated and
marginal; props up nonthreatening forms of resistance while attacking
those who take the biggest risks and the biggest leaps to get free.
There is an increasingly clear historical consensus that there was
never a purely nonviolent civil rights movement. The majority of those
who worked within the nonviolent tradition treated nonviolence as an
effective tactic, not a moral philosophy. Furthermore, to the degree that
nonviolence was an effective tactic, it was so only because of a histori-
cal combination of national and international dynamics—chiefly North-
ern disdain for Southern backwardness and Cold War competition for
influence over newly formed postcolonial governments in the Global
South—that allowed Northern liberals to side with Southern Black activ-
ists to force the federal government to care about its moral image in the


154 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

world. And still, even under those circumstances, nonviolent campaigners
were often protected by force of arms, and many campaigns “devolved”
into decidedly not-nonviolent rioting and direct action.
To understand riots and social movements today, tactically, strategi-
cally, and historically, many of us must transform our image of the Black
Freedom movement. We cannot afford to think of the Black Freedom
movement as made up of simple divisions between nonviolence and
militancy, civil rights and Black Power, South and North, leaders and
masses. Those historical and conceptual divisions were used then and are
used now to appease white liberals and to enforce the white supremacist
strategy of divide and conquer. The rioter and the looter were as funda-
mental to the movement as the Freedom Rider and the bus boycotter.
They are deserving of just as much honor, gratitude, and study.

The Black Freedom movement was at its most powerful and
its most visible during the years 1955–1975. But the struggle did not begin
suddenly in 1955, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a
white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama. Intense civil rights struggles
ensued throughout the forties. By 1955, however, these movements had
been decimated by a massive wave of political and social repression orga-
nized under the banner of anticommunism. When the civil rights move-
ment finally blossomed into national prominence, it grew from the ashes
of a radical social justice movement dismantled by McCarthyism.
As France fell to Hitler’s blitzkrieging armies in 1940, the United
States embarked on an incredible expansion of defense spending and
industrialization as it prepared to enter the war in Europe. It was this
massive wave of military production that finally ended the Great Depres-
sion. The US government also began a military draft, which kicked into
overdrive as the United States officially entered the war in December

1941. By the end of the war, nineteen million men had been drafted into
the US Army.
    War production created a lot of jobs, and more still were vacated
by drafted young men. Most of these jobs were in heavy industry. Up


```
No Such Thing as Nonviolence 155
```
until the war, this type of job had largely been the exclusive domain of
white men, protected and maintained as such by racist union organizing
and management hiring policy. But war destabilizes such traditions, and
Black, Asian, and Chicanx men and women, as well as white women,
were suddenly hired to fill the need for rapid production.
To get these jobs, and to escape the white supremacist violence of seg-
regationists, millions of Black people migrated out of the South in what
historians call the Second Great Migration, the largest internal migration
in American history.* They left sharecropping and domestic servitude
behind, hopefully forever, for the promise of higher-waged jobs and less
discrimination in industrial urban centers. As one woman who worked in
a factory during the war sardonically put it, “Lincoln may have freed the
slaves, but Hitler was the one that got us out of the white folks’ kitchen.”3†
But the needs of war production did not suddenly turn American
capitalists into champions of racial equity and justice. Black workers still
did the worst jobs in the plants, and at lower pay than white people in
the same positions. Black migrants ended up in redlined neighborhoods
and faced terrible treatment at the hand of Northern whites, particularly
landlords, police, and bosses.

*This migration was most pronounced on the West Coast, where Black populations grew
exponentially in San Diego, Oakland, LA, Richmond, and other cities with naval pro-
duction centers, but many laborers also went to Detroit, Chicago, the Twin Cities, and
St. Louis, as well as Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. The migration con-
tinued for two decades after the war, though at a slower rate. Many of those who stayed
in the South moved out of the fields and took jobs in cities like Charlotte, Memphis, or
Atlanta. The Second Great Migration can also be understood as a movement of Black
urbanization—by its completion, 80 percent of the American Black population lived in
cities. The period also saw massive numbers of Latinx workers and families migrate to the
same production centers. Much of the racial makeup of American cities was determined
in these years, although migration from Southeast Asia, China, Central America, and
Mexico post-1970, much of it in response to the Vietnam War and other US imperialist
violence, would further transform the West, while Caribbean migration changed the
Gulf states and migration from Brazil, North Africa, and the Middle East transformed
the Midwest and East Coast. White flight and then gentrification have caused white
populations to fluctuate dramatically in contested urban cores to this day.
†Jokes about Hitler and Tojo doing more to emancipate Black workers than FDR and
Lincoln were common in the war years (Dan Georgakas and Marvin Surkin, Detroit,
I Do Mind Dying: A Study in Urban Revolution [Cambridge, MA: South End Press,
1999]).


156 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

As a result of all these factors, World War II was a period of intense
racial conflict and social movement on the home front. Riots occurred
across the country, especially during the summer of 1943. The most infa-
mous incident is the June 1943 Zoot Suit Riot, which saw gangs of white
servicemen attack Mexican and Black teenagers in Los Angeles for wear-
ing oversized, baggy zoot suits, a subversive, countercultural, and, in the
face of wartime wool rationing, antimilitarist fashion. A few weeks later
a white versus Black brawl turned into a massive riot in Detroit, one of
the largest race riots of the twentieth century, in which thirty-four people
were killed in sixty hours of combat that was only quelled when federal
troops intervened. But rioting was not the only form of social conflict in
the period.
In 1941, A. Philip Randolph—leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping
Car Porters—planned what would become known as the first March on
Washington to protest segregation in the armed forces and the defense
industries. As it became clear, a week before the march, that he had orga-
nized more than a hundred thousand people to move on DC, President
Roosevelt panicked. Via executive order FDR banned segregation in the
war effort and created the Fair Employment Practices Committee. As a
result of this victory, Randolph called off the march but kept the organi-
zational infrastructure in place, turning it into the March on Washington
Movement (MOWM).
The Fair Employment Practices Committee proved to be another of
FDR’s canny concessions—it lacked enforcement mechanisms sufficient
to create real integration. Still, MOWM could claim victory, and it gave
agitators a framework for action. Alongside the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)—which, with the bril-
liant Ella Baker as new director of branches, would see its membership
grow ten times during the war—Congress of Racial Equality (CORE),
and other activist groups, MOWM continued to fight against defense
industry segregation, successfully forcing more federal action in 1943.
MOWM took a militant and radical approach, with an all-Black mem-
bership, a reliance on direct action, and open support for armed self-
defense and “fighting the war against racism” at home. Local movements

for work and housing justice also spread throughout the country, with
pickets, boycotts, and marches among the most common tactics.^4
As America fought a war in Europe against fascism, American lead-
ers were forced to publicly denounce the racist logic that animated it.
Black people called out the hypocrisy, pointing to racial discrimination
in the United States and demanding a “double V”—victory over fascism
at home and abroad. And the US allyship with the USSR meant the gov-
ernment had to stop promoting anticommunism, which since 1919 had
been a potent force of social control. Indeed, propaganda and political
pronouncements of the time praised the Soviet Union.
As a result, communists and radicals of all stripes, whose movement
had ebbed dramatically from their revolutionary heights in the mid-thir-
ties, were able to organize more openly. The Communist Party USA
(CPUSA), with a large Black membership, reached seventy-five thou-
sand strong in 1939, although much of the party’s working-class base had
left the party, and it was increasingly made up of professionals and the
middle classes. Unions that had been whites-only opened up with the
influx of Black workers into their industries and as emboldened radical
voices took center stage in the labor movement. And so a social justice
movement, involving Black Communists, reformers, and activists, uni-
fied with radical segments of labor, grew around demands for better hous-
ing, economic justice, and an end to Jim Crow and police violence.^5
Meanwhile, within the armed forces, resistance grew in the ranks of
Black soldiers. It is not stressed in heroic remembrances of the war, but
the US military was segregated. The irony of a Jim Crow army fighting
in the name of antifascism was not lost on Black soldiers. As Japanese cit-
izens were shipped off to FDR’s concentration camps, the vast majority
of Black soldiers were shipped around the world as laborers, not com-
batants. Something like 90 percent of the Black men who went through
basic training spent their service in work crews behind the lines, often
doing hard, dirty work under miserable labor conditions, sometimes un-
der white army officers/overseers pulled straight out of the sharecrop-
ping South. The Black regiments that did face battle, meanwhile, were
deployed into continuous action on the front lines for much longer

stretches than white regiments, which also received more rest and lived
in better conditions in camp.^6
This ill treatment of militarily trained young Black men had serious
repercussions. As historian Timothy Tyson writes, “The War Department
reported in 1943 [that] there was ‘general unrest’ among black troops all
over the country and the imminent danger of revolt; ‘most Negro sol-
diers have secreted ammunition,’ one War Department memo stated.”^7
Fights and riots broke out on bases and at training sites across the country
as Black servicemen fought with white supremacist police, officers, and
locals.
The full revolt never materialized, however, and the soldiers would
not win their double V.* Nevertheless, like their World War I predeces-
sors, Black veterans returned from fighting a “war for Democracy” abroad
to a racist social system at home. Trained in armed combat, these veterans
would become “the shock troops of the modern civil rights movement.”^8
When the war ended, many of the gains and concessions won by
Black activists were lost. As war production spun down, Black workers
were laid off in massive numbers—Black workers in America have always
been last hired, first fired—turning already cramped and underserved
Black neighborhoods into impoverished ghettos rife with unemploy-
ment. As white soldiers demobilized, white vigilante violence spiked.
Bosses stoked racial conflict to keep labor divided.
Still, the wartime movement, which combined labor and communist
radicalism with national Black civil rights struggle, might have survived
this and sparked a radical, even revolutionary civil rights movement ten
years earlier. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the United
States, projecting itself as the victorious champion of democracy as it
occupied Japan and much of Europe, had to counterpoise these claims

*The armed forces wouldn’t be desegregated until the movement and considerable in-
ternational embarrassment forced Truman’s hand in 1948. And after World War II, as
the US Army occupied what would become West Germany, Black soldiers experienced
better freedom of movement and action and more respect in post-Nazi Germany than
they ever had in the Southern United States, an experience they would bring back with
them into the freedom struggle (Maria Höhn, “‘We Will Never Go Back to the Old Way
Again’: Germany in the African-American Debate on Civil Rights,” Central European
History 41, no. 4 [2008], 605–637).

with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a postwar increase in
racial violence and lynching, and the army’s segregation. As global at-
tention turned to the war’s victors, more than just Black Americans recog-
nized Jim Crow for the fascism it clearly was. Black Communists such as
Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Claudia Jones advanced as leading
national figures of the period, touring the country, writing, organizing,
performing, and speaking on racial injustice and fascism at home.
For the white power structure, then, the Cold War provided a perfect
opportunity to change the conversation and unleash a wave of repression.
As US foreign policy turned from fighting fascism to solidifying US im-
perialism, in the form of market and political influence over the (soon-
to-be-deemed) Third World, the Soviet Union transformed into enemy
number one. And as a crucial domestic component of the Cold War, a
paranoid, fear-mongering Far Right movement, spawned in the offices of
FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, seeped out from the federal government to
pervade the entire United States, with disastrous consequences.
In the name of “anticommunism,” thousands upon thousands of
Americans lost their jobs, their careers, their freedom, and sometimes
even their lives. The second Red Scare, more often referred to as Mc-
Carthyism, is most famous for two particular moments: Senator Joe
McCarthy accusing hundreds of government employees of Communist
subversion and artists, intellectuals, and Hollywood stars testifying in
front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and the
ensuing Hollywood blacklist. But it was much more.
At its height, from 1947 to 1957, the Red Scare, carried out by a
network of intelligence agents, cops, federal employees, informants,
and businessmen, argued that Communists had infiltrated the United
States and all of its institutions. These Communists had to be mercilessly
named, shamed, and taken out of positions of power to protect national
interests and national defense.
The scare saw hundreds of political prosecutions, deportations of ac-
cused Communists, and even two people, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg,
sent to the electric chair.^9 But its most widespread tactics were economic
coercion, blacklists, and a generalized atmosphere of fear and suspicion.
Thousands of rank-and-file workers in all industries, a huge number of

them Black, most of them union, were fired and blacklisted, making
earning a livelihood impossible. Workers were fired for associating with
radical labor, leftist political organizations, and CPUSA front groups, for
expressing left-of-mainstream opinions, or simply for being accused of
any of the above. Radical academics, journalists, lawyers, and other pro-
fessionals lost their jobs, and often their careers, as did many Hollywood
writers, actors, and producers. The CPUSA, which had already largely
been abandoned by working-class white people bought off by the New
Deal, basically collapsed. Claudia Jones was imprisoned and deported;
Robeson and Du Bois had their passports revoked.
The Red Scare, like all anticommunist and anti-Left repressions his-
torically, included a significant uptick in oppression along other axes.
A massive outing and purge of gay men and lesbian women in the fed-
eral government occurred, sometimes referred to as the Lavender Scare.
Civil rights organizations such as the NAACP were accused of Com-
munist infiltration and collaboration, and, shamefully, they too barred
Communists from their organization and participated in purges of their
ranks. As Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor writes, “Socialists and communists
were so identified with the antiracist movement that antiracist organizing
was automatically assumed to be the work of communists.”^10
The final transformation of major labor unions into predominantly
reactionary organizations was achieved in the period. Liberals and right
wingers within unions, insisting on their patriotism, used the Red Scare
to eliminate their political opponents on the left, while anticommunist
unions used the scare to smash radical ones and take over their shops
and industries. The CIO, little more than a decade removed from its
heroic sit-down strikes, led the way, publicly and patriotically declaring
the barring of Communists and the purging of leftists. The fact that these
radicals and their unions were often the strongest and most dedicated
organizers meant the labor movement would never again achieve the
strength it had before the scare.*

*Of course, there were moments when labor seemed to be reviving in strength, partic-
ularly the powerful antiracist labor upsurge that lasted from 1969 to 1973. We are seeing
a similar upsurge as of this writing, in 2020, with three years of increased labor activity
building into the coronavirus-19 wildcats that are tearing through the country at the


```

```
Along with the disciplining of the labor movement and the near total
collapse of the CPUSA came a general atmosphere of antiradicalism.
Being accused of Communist sympathies could cost you everything:
“These sanctions—or more commonly the fear of them—were sufficient
to keep people from joining the Left or advocating unpopular positions
in public.”^11
This atmosphere destroyed the momentum of Black organizing built
during the war years. For one example, a powerful movement called the
Black Popular Front had emerged in New York City in the late 1940s. As
historian Brian Purnell writes, the Black Popular Front “brought together
many different organizations and activists—labor unions, religious insti-
tutions, fraternal organizations, women’s groups, Democratic and third-
party politicians, Communists, Socialists, and others—and pushed an
antiracist agenda into mainstream municipal and state policy debates.”^12
But these alliances collapsed under the pressure of anticommunist accu-
sations, smears, and paranoia. Thus, social movements and organizations
not only kicked out radicals within their own ranks but also drifted away
from one another. The cross-racial, cross-issue alliances built during the
war died.
Gerald Horne has argued that the Red Scare, which disempowered
Black radicals and led to an absence of radical labor and Communist
organizers in Black communities, was one key factor in separatist Black
nationalism—rather than a more anticapitalist politics—becoming the
spontaneous worldview for many who rose up in the Black Freedom
movement of the sixties.^13 Whatever the case, the Red Scare meant that
when Rosa Parks did sit down on that bus in Montgomery, on Decem-
ber 1, 1955, she did so in a country that had swung far to the right on
questions of economic and social justice, a country where potential allies
were largely disorganized and demoralized.

time of this writing. But radical labor would never again be the leader of a general and
nationwide movement for liberation in the United States, as it would be in Europe and
Latin America in the 1960s and 1970s.


162 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

When Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her
seat on that fateful morning, her local activist network saw it as the per-
fect “test case” they had been waiting for to challenge Montgomery seg-
regation. Parks would go to trial the following Monday, December 5.
The Women’s Political Council—a local advocacy organization run by
Black women—organized a bus boycott against segregation for the day
of Parks’s trial, hand printing thousands of leaflets overnight and distrib-
uting them over the weekend. The NAACP and a group of Montgomery
ministers helped the Women’s Political Council get the word out and
joined them in supporting the boycott.
Almost no Black people rode the buses on the fifth; the boycott was
a success beyond the organizers’ anticipations. The boycott was meant
to last only the one day, but at a mass meeting that night—a boisterous,
joyous meeting that featured the inspiring oratory of a young preacher re-
cently moved to Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr.—the crowd unan-
imously voted to extend the boycott indefinitely.
The boycott lasted an entire year. Demonstrating the possibilities
of grassroots organization in practice, the people of Montgomery and
the Montgomery Improvement Association maintained the boycott by
organizing and dispatching caravans of cars that brought thirty thousand
working people to and from their jobs in white homes and businesses in
downtown Montgomery every day.* As Rosa Parks describes it, “Quite a
sophisticated system was developed. There were twenty private cars and
fourteen station wagons. There were thirty-two pickup and transfer sites,
and scheduled service from five-thirty in the morning until twelve-thirty
at night.”^14 It was an incredible achievement: the entire community orga-
nized and mobilized for a full year, overcoming police harassment and
waves of arrest, intimidation, and bargaining. Their inspiring struggle

*Founded on December 4, the Montgomery Improvement Association was an autono-
mous local organization headed by Dr. King. It was formed to lead the boycott so as to
avoid national interference from the NAACP, of which many of the MIA leaders, includ-
ing Parks and King, were also members. They feared that the NAACP might either ne-
gotiate away the movement to declare an early victory or try to dominate the movement
to follow in its image.


```

```
and eventual victory made headlines worldwide. King and Parks, in par-
ticular, were brought to national prominence during the boycott.
Even at the time, the incredible, women-led feat of people power
was beginning to be mythologized and transformed into a story of indi-
vidual heroics on the part of King and Parks. The myth that Parks had
sparked the movement because of the singular bravery and novelty of her
action was already growing. Though incredibly brave, she was not the
first person to be arrested standing up to bus segregation in Montgom-
ery. Nine months previously, Claudette Colvin had been arrested on the
same charge for the same action. But Black organizers had decided that
Colvin would not be their test case: Colvin was fifteen, impoverished,
and pregnant out of wedlock from an affair with a married man. She was
described as “feisty” and “mouthy.” Her father had been in prison. She
did not have the dignified, middle-class life or manners of Parks. Colvin’s
resistance, they reasoned, would have taken a backseat to a trial of her
character.^15
But even in portraying Parks as the definition of nonviolent, respect-
able femininity, as a quiet, demure seamstress who one day changed the
world, the narrative clouds history to deradicalize its protagonists. Parks
and Colvin were hardly alone: though theirs would become the most
famous instigating moment, dozens of direct action movements were un-
der way across the South in 1955. And Parks herself had been organizing
for more than a decade already when she sat down on that bus. Though
she was a proponent of organized nonviolent protest, she also believed in
and practiced armed self-defense. Parks was a supporter of Robert F. Wil-
liams and would later call Malcolm X her personal hero. She spent her
entire life a militant activist against segregation, sexual violence, and the
justice system; on a few occasions she resisted white racists with threats
of violence.^16 To reduce this radical lifelong activist to a single quiet act
of protest serves as a good metonym for reducing the extensive spread of
cultural, political, and social movements for Black liberation to a handful
of nonviolent campaigns, protests, and sit-ins.
The choice to organize around Parks rather than Colvin was a tac-
tical one made by a small organization that could have had no idea of


164 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

its decision’s success, let alone its national or historical impact. But still,
from its very first moments of national recognition, the Southern civil
rights struggle was stage-managed to appear respectable.
This strategy emerged from the antiradical movement atmosphere of
post-McCarthyite America. Though it would win some allies and assist
in some struggles, the political logic of nonviolence, propriety, media-
focused-activism, organizational hierarchy, and internal antiradicalism
placed a massive limit on possibilities that the movement would have to
overcome. The strategy benefited middle-class leaders and middle-class
concerns at the expense of true revolutionary change. Appeals to the
movement’s image and the moral imperative of nonviolence were used
to silence and control poor Black people in their struggles, and they have
been used in the intervening years to erase the vision and contributions
of these people.

For many in the civil rights struggle, the contradiction em-
bodied by Rosa Parks—believing in the efficacy of the tactic of nonvio-
lence and the moral righteousness of protecting yourself with guns—was
solved rather simply. When white terrorists attacked the home of Hartman
Turnbow, a Black farmer in Holmes County, Mississippi, he “pushed his
family out the back door and grabbed the rifle off the wall and started
shooting. And his explanation was simply that ‘I was not being .  . .
non-nonviolent, I was protecting my wife and family.’”^17 In the face of
white supremacist terror, shooting back was not a moral question, it was
a necessity.
As the title of Charles Cobb’s book about his experience in the move-
ment put it, many in the South believed that This Nonviolent Stuff’ll
Get You Killed. The South in the 1950s was a place of constant state and
vigilante violence. As Cobb writes, mass public “spectacle lynching” had
largely disappeared. Instead, in the 1940s and 1950s “antiblack violence
began to take on a more covert character: assassination, kidnapping,
bombings.”^18 The most common image of white supremacist terror was
no longer the lynch mob or the white rioter but the night rider. The night


```

rider gets his name from his most famous activity: driving through Black
neighborhoods under cover of darkness, firing guns, throwing firebombs,
kidnapping people, and making noise to intimidate. The night rider was
no less common than his predecessors, but he did not always operate with
the safety in numbers of the popular mobs of the prewar era, making him
more vulnerable to a blast of buckshot.
The night rider gained national attention during the very first years of
the civil rights struggle as the tactic spread across the South in response to
Supreme Court decisions that pushed back against Jim Crow. In 1954 the
Supreme Court ruled, in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated
schools were unconstitutional. As James Baldwin noted, many Black peo-
ple at the time understood that “this immense concession would [never]
have been made if it had not been for the competition of the Cold War,
and the fact that Africa was clearly liberating herself and therefore had,
for political reasons, to be wooed by the descendants of her former mas-
ters.”* Throughout the era, the importance of America’s global image in
securing the allegiance of newly postcolonial African nations was para-
mount in national civil rights legislation, while links with anticolonial
struggles in Africa inspired Black activists to greater and greater militancy.
Brown v. Board applied no mode of enforcement, no road map for
integration. Nevertheless, it was a landmark decision. It provided a legal
basis for change, allowing activists to bring lawsuits that resulted in court
decisions outlawing local school segregation. But it would have remained
a mere political gesture were it not for movements enforcing its decision.
The first to move were not the forces of integration, however, but
of reaction. Immediately after the decision, Virginia senator Harry Byrd
described it as an unprecedented threat to “states’ rights”—a phrase that
always has and always will mean white power. He got to work organiz-
ing politicians around what he would famously call “massive resistance”
in which Southern state governments fought integration by all available
methods.

*The quotation continues: “Had it been a matter of love or justice, the 1954 decision
would surely have occurred sooner; were it not for the realities of power in this difficult
era, it might very well not have occurred yet” (James Baldwin, Fire Next Time [New York:
Random House, 1993], 75).

Massive resistance intensified segregation and its associated violence
dramatically. In response to desegregation of school systems by local
courts, whites-only private schools opened across the South. Some local
school systems literally shut down, refusing to educate even their own
white children rather than integrate. But massive resistance also meant
a dramatic uptick in night riding, assassination, firebombing, and pub-
lic harassment. The White Citizen Councils and the KKK dramatically
increased their memberships, their presence, and their rates of action.
They targeted politically active residents and community leaders in an
effort to destroy local civil rights infrastructure.
Even so, dozens and dozens of struggles, large and small, north and
south, desegregation campaigns, and organized self-defense were waged
in the period between Montgomery’s boycott of 1956 and the student sit-
ins of 1960. But the outcomes of these struggles were often frustrating or
inconclusive.
The most famous, the integration of Central High School in Little
Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, demonstrates the ambivalence of the period’s vic-
tories. Nine Black students, the so-called Little Rock Nine, enrolled, with
the help of the NAACP, at all-white Central High in the summer of 1957.
When they showed up for the first week of school, they were blocked by a
racist mob. They were eventually admitted to the school at bayonet point
when scenes of the mob ballooned into a national scandal and President
Eisenhower sent in the National Guard. Even with the guard, the stu-
dents faced white mobs lining their path, with harassment and threats
of violence hurled at them every day. They suffered physical attacks and
abuse in the school itself. The governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, shut
down the entire Little Rock school system for academic year 1958–1959
rather than follow a court order to integrate further. When school re-
sumed in the fall of 1959, so did the mobs. Though the impossibly brave
Little Rock Nine continued to attend Central High, they hardly received
a good public education, and they were not immediately followed by
other Black students.
Thus, massive resistance, supported by state and vigilante alike,
proved to be an effective block to nonviolent integration struggles. Of
course, vigilantes were not particularly far removed from the state. Night

riders and KKK processions were often escorted and led by police cars in
the name of “public safety,” and police turned over prisoners to Klans-
men for savage beatings and lynchings.^19 It has been revealed that Bir-
mingham, Alabama, public safety commissioner Bull Connor and local
police coordinated the KKK attacks on Freedom Riders in 1961 and again
on protesters in 1963, all with the knowledge and implicit consent of the
FBI. But this kind of cooperation happened behind closed doors. Most
often just enough room was left between government and assassins to
provide plausible deniability.
Another major way the state supported night riders, white rapists,
and lynchers was by not prosecuting them. In the rare instances when
charges were brought—as in the case of Emmett Till—white juries just
never found lynchers guilty. The police today have inherited not only
their predecessors’ campaign of terror and violence but also their judicial
immunity. With no recourse to the courts or the police, and with the
ever-present threat of the Klansman and the night riders, Black folks in
the South did what they had been doing since the Civil War: they armed
themselves.

chapter seven (^) | USING GUNS NONVIOLENTLY
I
n 1959, Robert F. Williams, president of the Monroe, North
Carolina, branch of the NAACP, caused a national scandal when he de-
clared to reporters, after the acquittal of a white rapist who had attacked
a woman in broad daylight and in front of witnesses, that it was “time to
meet violence with violence.” Though largely forgotten now, Williams
was nearly as important and famous a figure for the Black Power move-
ment as Malcolm X.
Robert F. Williams was not, however, some visionary individually
pushing militancy forward. His comments that day had been wrenched
out of him by the women of Monroe, who were absolutely furious with
him. Just before he spoke, the women had been admonishing Williams
for convincing them not to attack the rapist’s house and get justice on
their own terms, as they had planned. Williams had insisted that they
should wait for the courts, that they would find justice there. The analysis
by Williams, who would go on to advocate armed struggle and become
an internationally known proponent of Black Power and socialist revolu-
tion, was on that day trailing far behind that of the women. This inter-
nationalist revolutionary was the product of his local movement, whose
core activist base was poor Black women.


170 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

The struggle in Monroe had begun in earnest in the summer of 1957,
when a Black boy drowned in a swimming hole outside of town. Monroe
had a swimming pool, but it was whites-only, and so Black children beat
the summer heat in unsupervised and often dangerous swimming holes
in the countryside. As a result, drownings were a regular occurrence: pool
segregation was lethal. So Robert Williams and local chapter vice presi-
dent Dr. Albert Perry gathered a group of local young folks and went to
“stand-in” at the pool.
The NAACP is hardly renowned for militant direct action—it was
predominantly a respectable, middle-class organization focused on hir-
ing lawyers to pursue legal challenges to segregation. But in many towns
in the South, it was the only Black political organization around. In the
period, its local branches were often more radical and less middle class
than its central office and national image.
The Monroe chapter was particularly working class. Williams had
inherited an almost entirely inactive branch and had directly focused on
recruiting from pool halls, beauty parlors, and other places working-class
folks were found. This makeup of the Monroe movement no doubt
helped it set aside respectability politics as the summer and the struggle
over the pool heated up. The town refused to integrate the pool and re-
fused a number of other compromises Williams and the NAACP offered.
And so activists would go down to the pool to try to get in, and officials
would close the pool while Williams and others picketed outside.
But Williams hadn’t merely revived the Monroe NAACP, he had also
chartered a National Rifle Association (NRA) chapter. Many Black folks
in Monroe who didn’t already have guns acquired some, and men and
women learned to shoot straighter as members of a gun club Williams
organized.
These guns reflected the fact that Monroe was also one of the main
centers of KKK activity in North Carolina. As the summer wore on, white
crowds outside the pool and Klan night riders intensified their attacks.
Rumor spread that the KKK was going to attack Dr. Perry’s home. Ac-
tivists reinforced his house with sandbags and stationed an armed guard
there. The rumors were right: one night, the Klan showed up to shoot up
the place, but the Monroe movement was prepared and the house was


```
Using Guns Nonviolently 171
```
full of activists, who fired back. Surprised, the Klan fled. It appears that
the defenders killed a Klansman in the fight, but the white folks covered
it up so as not to let the news get out too widely that armed Black people
had defeated the Klan.
This gunfight largely ended white violence in Monroe, both against
demonstrators and from night riders. In Williams’s analysis, white fas-
cists are cowards: believing their lives to be more valuable than those of
whom they oppress, they are rarely willing to risk death for their goals.
Though the Klan continued to occasionally harass and threaten Williams
and other leaders, it never regained the upper hand. As Williams would
write five years later, “Our sit-ins proved that self-defense and nonviolence
could be successfully combined. There was less violence in the Monroe
sit-ins than in any other sit-ins in the South. In other communities there
were Negroes who had their skulls fractured, but not a single demonstra-
tor was even spat upon during our sit-ins. We had less violence because we
had shown the willingness and readiness to fight and defend ourselves.”^1
When, in 1959, Williams declared it was time to “meet violence
with violence,” he wasn’t espousing a macho creed, he was reflecting
the learned wisdom of the Monroe movement.* And, as his wife, Mabel

*Williams’s remarks were published widely in the national press, which claimed that
an NAACP leader was calling for race war. After the controversy, the NAACP national
office sanctioned Williams and stripped him of his presidency. But the local people
organized around and protected Williams and kept him in a leadership position—where
he would help the movement in its successful desegregation of Monroe civic services
such as the pool and the public library. After a series of inspiring struggles in Monroe,
tensions built to the point when a full-on insurrection seemed in the offing. To head it
off, Williams was framed for kidnapping a white couple and chased out of the county,
and then the country, and then off the continent. Williams would go on to organize and
agitate from Cuba, where he wrote an autobiography, Negroes with Guns, a monthly
radical newsletter, The Crusader, and a radio show, Radio Free Dixie, with which he sent
increasingly militant propaganda into the South. He encouraged people to form gun
clubs and to organize around self-defense, critiqued nonviolence as a moral philosophy,
and presciently predicted and analyzed the riots of the mid-1960s. His journal gave in-
structions in guerilla and urban warfare and taught people how to make Molotov cock-
tails and explosives. But despite being hosted by Cuba and then, later, Mao’s China, he
resisted joining their official Communist Parties, maintaining an independent position
as a Black radical and becoming leader in exile of the Revolutionary Action Movement
(RAM) and then the Republic of New Afrika. For more on the incredible life of Robert
F. Williams, read his autobiography, Negroes with Guns, and read Timothy B. Tyson’s
Radio Free Dixie.

Williams, remarked that same year, “Women are pushing harder than
the men. . . . That is where our drive is coming from.” In one of the first
major moments in the campaign, before even the assault on his house,
Dr. Perry had been arrested and was in danger of being lynched, so a
group of women had gathered rifles and stormed the jail, freeing him.
Monroe’s vision of an armed, self-defensive civil rights movement—
though it was officially opposed by the NAACP, CORE, and the newly
formed Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) centered
around Martin Luther King and the other charismatic Southern preach-
ers of the movement—had supporters across the country, including
SCLC-aligned Rosa Parks and Ella Baker. It would go on to be the inspi-
ration for many movements across the South, culminating most visibly
in the Deacons for Defense and Justice, a group that formed in 1964 to
provide armed escorts to marches in Louisiana and Mississippi.^2 But the
inspiration of the events in Monroe largely remained unofficial and in
the shadows because, in 1960, the students of Greensboro, North Caro-
lina, spectacularly and bravely demonstrated the power of nonviolence,
and nonviolence became the “official” tactic and philosophy of the
movement.

The events of 1960–1963 are the most famous and mytholo-
gized of the entire civil rights era and among the most famous of the
twentieth century in America. On February 1, 1960, four students from
North Carolina A&T University sat down at a whites-only lunch counter
in the Greensboro Woolworth, where they were refused service. They
stayed until closing time. The next day twenty students showed up. The
following, sixty. The day after that, three hundred protesters. Within
a few weeks, sit-ins had spread all across North Carolina and to Nash-
ville, Tennessee, Lexington, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia. By the
spring, almost all the cities of the South were experiencing nonviolent
sit-in movements in their downtowns. Dozens of lunch counters, hotels,
and restaurants were desegregated, although some weathered the storm
and remained whites-only.

Images of students being beaten, spat upon, and arrested for sitting
on a stool spread nationwide and did exactly what nonviolence tactics
are meant to do: galvanize anger, support, resistance, and pity. It was an
important, radicalizing moment. To capture the energy unleashed by the
student movement, Ella Baker, frustrated with the misogyny, hierarchy,
and cult of personality dominating the SCLC she had just left, set up a
meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, in April that would give birth to the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).
The organization was infused with Baker’s organizational style, which
was structured around a simple, antihierarchical principle: “strong peo-
ple don’t need strong leaders.” In the same vein, she would never be
its official head, leaving that position to the students, though she would
remain its philosophical and organizational lodestone. The SNCC ad-
opted her grassroots approach that focused on cultivating local organiz-
ers, with the goal that an organizer eventually made herself unnecessary
as the local movement took on its own momentum. This was coupled
with internal democracy that made the organization capable of shift-
ing dynamically to reflect the changing opinions of its membership.^3
This bottom-up approach, opposed to the paper-membership, media-
spectacle, mass-demonstration style that has been passed down to us as
MLK’s legacy, made SNCC perhaps the most vital force in the Southern
movement.
Nonviolent tactics again proved effective in the next massive cam-
paign, the Freedom Rides of 1961. Modeled on the 1947 Journey for
Reconciliation, in which CORE activists had attempted to test a 1946
Supreme Court ruling outlawing segregation on interstate travel, CORE
again organized white and Black activists to ride together on buses into
the Deep South, to test that and another Supreme Court ruling, from
1960, that desegregated restaurants and seating areas in stations.
The Freedom Riders traveled through the upper South in relative
peace, but in Alabama and Mississippi they faced terrible violence, with
a few activists beaten nearly to death. After a ferocious attack by the Klan
in Birmingham, Alabama—coordinated with local police and with FBI
knowledge—CORE withdrew its organizers. SNCC, led by Diane Nash,
was convinced such a defeat at the hands of mob violence would be


174 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

a disaster and sent replacement activists to continue the rides. Massive
mobs met buses at stations; segregationists lit one bus on fire while Free-
dom Riders were still on board. The violence shocked the country, and
the rides lasted throughout the summer of 1961, eventually forcing Presi-
dent Kennedy to end bus segregation on interstate travel.
The Freedom Rides were incredibly inspiring events, putting the
whole country on notice of the seriousness of the movement. They both
proved SNCC’s effectiveness and inspired local movements wherever
Freedom Riders went in the South. Ironically, however, the Freedom
Rides, which cemented nonviolence as the definitive tactic of the move-
ment, would also be the last major success of the tactic.
As struggles blossomed all over the South, the philosophy of nonvio-
lence met the reality of Black life under Jim Crow and the truth of night
riders, the KKK, and fascist police. Many Black people in the rural South
were already armed as a result of subsistence hunting combined with a
history of effective Black self-defense and a generalized Southern gun
culture: many Northern workers who went south acquired guns as well.
Even the Freedom Riders had been protected, while they stayed with
Black supporters overnight, by armed guards.
As many recent historical studies have demonstrated, although the
major organizations—SNCC, CORE, NAACP, SCLC—all declared
themselves officially nonviolent, guns kept their activists safe in the South
while they carried out agitation, organization, and movement.* Akinyele
Omowale Umoja argues that Robert F. Williams was an exception be-
cause he advocated armed tactics publicly, not because he used those
tactics—most of the movements and activists in the South had recourse
to guns during their struggle. As professor and SNCC member Charles
Cobb wrote, “Willingness to engage in armed self-defense played an im-
portant role in the southern Freedom Movement, for without it, terrorists
would have killed far more people in the movement.” Rather than the
stark distinction polemically laid out by Malcolm X, that it was either

the ballot or the bullet, Kwame Jeffries writes that for most in the Black
Freedom movement, “the relationship between ballots and bullets was
both/and.”^4
The advocates of nonviolence were, of course, well aware of this dy-
namic. Charles Cobb writes, “For most activists .  . . nonviolence was
simply a useful tactic, one that did not preclude self-defense whenever it
was considered necessary and possible. Even King . . . acknowledged the
legitimacy of self-defense and sometimes blurred the line between non-
violence and self-defense.”^5 It wasn’t just MLK. As Lance Hill records:
“James Lawson, the movement’s foremost spokesperson for Gandhian
nonviolence, admitted later that there ‘never has been an acceptance
of the nonviolent approach’ in the South and the idea that blacks had
initially accepted nonviolence and then became disillusioned was
‘nonsense.’”^6
But if none of that was the historical case, how has it become such
a unified narrative? As ever, history has been written by the victors. The
Northern media and white liberals were eager to support the end of
Jim Crow, as it tainted the image of the United States in the Cold War
and, no less significantly, offered a massive potential bloc of Black vot-
ers to the party that could end it. But, just like their Republican and
union predecessors a hundred years previously, they were unwilling to
accept any fundamental challenges to the system, let alone any tactics
that might threaten their own white supremacist hegemony in the West
and the North, and so “nonviolence” became the happy and celebrated
compromise.
The tactic of nonviolence was critiqued and ultimately disproven
in the streets, but, after the movement was defeated in the early 1970s,
a huge media, academic, and governmental project of falsification via
co-optation of MLK, Parks, and the movement took place, unfolding over
decades and slowly defanging and mystifying the actual way the move-
ment moved. And the falsification involved in proving the efficacy of
nonviolence is nowhere clearer than in the history of Birmingham.


176 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

It was the struggle in Birmingham, Alabama, that would lead
to the creation of the first Civil Rights Act. The Birmingham desegrega-
tion fight in 1963 shook the world, with televised images of Black children
being blasted with fire hoses and attacked by public safety commissioner
Eugene “Bull” Connor’s police dogs. The harrowing images brought
MLK and the SCLC, leaders of the Birmingham struggle, back into the
national spotlight after a disastrous previous campaign.
From 1961 to 1962 in Albany, Georgia, King and fellow activists had
been utterly defeated by chief of police Laurie Pritchett, who took careful
advantage of nonviolence’s tactical weaknesses. Disciplining his police
force to never engage in violent arrests, and dispersing arrested activists to
jails outside of and around Albany—thus destroying the core nonviolent
tactic of “filling the jails” that creates logistical crises for the police—
Pritchett completely removed nonviolence’s main forms of leverage. The
Albany movement, despite a very large activist base and almost fully mo-
bilized community, ended in bitter defeat.
But, though the Birmingham campaign started much the same way
as Albany had, it faced a much less peaceful and disciplined police force
and was itself less insistent on nonviolence. King had much less con-
trol, and this lack of top-down control was to the movement’s benefit.
As activist-historian Lorenzo Raymond writes: “King wasn’t able to get
consistent media coverage until after protests became, as Taylor Branch
put it, ‘a duel of rocks and fire hoses.’ One of King’s aides, Vincent Hard-
ing, later acknowledged that the black youth who came to dominate the
campaign’s street action were ‘the children of Malcom X’ and that their
escalation to ‘a burning, car-smashing, police-battling response’ marked
Birmingham as ‘the first of the period’s urban rebellions.’”^7
Rioters took over and held the downtown for days, smashing store-
fronts and successfully beating back the police. This rioting not only de-
fined the campaign but also proved crucial to its historical effects and
relevance. It was this riot and the fear of it spreading to other cities—
combined with international relations problems caused by images of Bir-
mingham police violence—that forced Kennedy into giving his famous
speech calling for civil rights legislation and compelled his administra-
tion to draft what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The rioting


```

```
wouldn’t have happened without the organizing, marches, and rallies of
the movement, and that effort, as in Albany, wouldn’t have won without
the rioting.
But in the wake of Birmingham, national civil rights leaders down-
played the violence. The official text of the moment became MLK’s
Letter from a Birmingham Jail, while the images that broke through the
national consciousness (and remain to this day) are dogs snapping and
firehoses blasting Black children—images of Black victimization—not
images of those children getting up and throwing rocks at the police.
MLK distanced himself from the rioters to promote a narrative of a uni-
fied and nonviolent philosophy of the movement, and he immediately
pivoted toward organizing the March on Washington.
If so many of the movements were driven by not-nonviolent methods,
and so many of the activists remained alive by force of arms, why did they
so widely spread the myth of their own nonviolence?*

Nonviolence gave the early civil rights movement the legit-
imacy it required to receive support from Northern liberals. Money from
liberals kept organizers in the field, while white media coverage kept
national attention on the struggle. Nonviolence gave Black folks moral
room to maneuver in a country that always a priori viewed them as crim-
inal and immoral—no small achievement. And it won widespread sym-
pathy and demonstrated that the violence of police and (Southern) white
people was unprovoked and thus inherent to their power.

*I use the rather clunky phrase not-nonviolent purposely. For some nonviolence ideo-
logues, breaking windows, lighting trash on fire, or even building barricades in the street
is “violent.” I once witnessed a group of Black teens chanting “Fuck the Police” get
shouted at for “being violent” by a white protester. Though there are more forms of vi-
olence than just literal physical blows to a human body, I don’t believe a conception of
“violence” that encompasses both throwing trash in the street and the murder of Michael
Brown is remotely helpful. Calling breaking a window “violent” reproduces this useless
definition and places the whole argument within the rhetorical structure of nonviolence
ideology. Not-nonviolent, then, becomes the more useful term. I first encountered the
term in the work of Lorenzo Raymond.


178 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

But nonviolence suffered from strategic weaknesses, too, namely,
overestimating the power of the white liberal. The strategy of nonvio-
lence hinged on Southern racist violence producing sympathy among
liberals and thus leading them to fight for structural change in state and
federal governments. As C. E. Wilson wrote in 1964, “The extent of white
liberal influence with the power structure had been totally overestimated
and its direction misunderstood. The Southern white liberal was only a
celebrity in the North and the Northern white liberal was more inter-
ested in the South. In his own back yard the white liberal was virtually
powerless or isolated and attacked by other hostile whites.”^8
But there is a more fundamental problem with nonviolence: when it
is no longer a tactic among many, and is instead pushed as a philosoph-
ical, moral, or religious principle, it gains a nasty, authoritarian edge. As
Lance Hill writes: “By giving the luster of religious precept to a pragmatic
stratagem to attract white liberals—while accommodating liberal fears of
black violence—the national civil rights leadership took the high moral
ground and made their critics look like nihilistic advocates of violence.”^9
This moral division adds a new layer of shame and rejection onto those
who take not-nonviolent action to free themselves, which, as we’ve seen,
actually included most of the Southern movement.
The strategic maintenance of the image of nonviolence, pushed by the
heads of organizations, the media, liberal politicians, and well- meaning
but naive middle-class white allies alike, forced many activists into si-
lence, keeping them from telling the truth of their experience, namely,
that guns were keeping them safe, that self-defense worked. As the move-
ment moved forward, and urban riots and rebellions spread, liberals, who
had only a few years previously believed any civil disobedience was too
militant and that Black folks were moving too fast, used the principle of
nonviolence they now embraced to dismiss and attack the uprisings.
Police have learned this technique particularly well. Nonviolence is
the essential tool in the protest policing technique of “controlled man-
agement” and the tactic of divide and conquer, as they try to “coordinate”
protest marches with organization officials and protest marshals and ac-
cuse outside agitators, antifa, “white anarchists,” or any other preferred
boogeyman for the militancy that emerges organically from struggles for


```
Using Guns Nonviolently 179
```
freedom. The police are helped by people theoretically on our side, who
are happy to accuse anyone who acts not-nonviolently of being an agent
provocateur and who will even turn people in for not-nonviolent acts,
damning them to the terrible violence of the police and prison system in
the name of pacifism.
But what is nonviolent resistance? It seems obvious, but, in fact,
nonviolent resistance is an incredibly nebulous and murky concept. In
practice, it can mean almost anything: Birmingham is claimed as a non-
violent success—the rioting is unmentioned or written off as unimport-
ant or as things “getting out of hand”—whereas breaking a window on a
march today, although no one is hurt, is almost always called violence.
The 2011 revolution in Egypt is still sometimes described as a non-
violent victory, despite the vast arson of police and government buildings;
massive rioting in Suez, Alexandria, and Cairo; widespread looting; and
the killing of over a dozen police officers. Meanwhile, the Movement for
Black Lives, which, despite including looting and arson, has killed no
one, is roundly condemned as too violent. Nonviolent ideologues tend to
claim militant movements as evidence of their philosophy’s power if the
movements happen far away—geographically or historically—but they
attack any and all militancy that occurs closer to home.
This open-ended definition provides for much of nonviolence’s au-
thoritarian character. Gandhi, the racist, misogynist founder of modern
nonviolent philosophy, firmly kept for himself the power to determine
what was violent in the Indian independence movement. On two oc-
casions he called off strikes by his followers by calling them “violent”—
forcing the movement into months of introspection, self-critique, and
reorganization—because friends of his owned the factories being struck
against. His anti-Blackness is now widely known: as an advocate for In-
dians in South Africa, he continually expressed his hatred and disdain
for Black Africans, worrying that European colonizers were degrading
Indians to “their level.” He also believed menstruation was a sign of cor-
ruption, campaigned against contraception, believed fathers were right
to honor-kill assaulted daughters, and made young female followers sleep
naked in bed with him to prove his purity. All of these positions are appar-
ently in accord with nonviolence.


180 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

In the United States in the sixties, nonviolence was equally used as
a tool to bludgeon movements the powerful didn’t like. Liberals used
nonviolence to rail against the 1964 “stall-in” organized by Brooklyn’s
CORE, which would have congested traffic to the World’s Fair by stall-
ing out cars on the highway. The action was meant to focus the eyes of
the city and the world on Black poverty, partially achieved by the fact
that impoverished neighborhoods would be directly visible to World Fair
visitors stuck on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Opponents screamed
that CORE had abandoned nonviolence. If causing a traffic jam is mor-
ally reprehensible violence, then nonviolence truly leaves us with almost
no tools to fight oppression.
Nonviolence in the civil rights movement was mostly pointed toward
gaining liberal support, instigating federal intervention in the South, and
forcing the creation of new laws. But new laws are enforced by the police,
and federal intervention often entails sending in the National Guard.
Why does sending the National Guard to defend a march at gunpoint
constitute nonviolence? Nonviolent practitioners today are happy to or-
ganize their marches in collaboration with the police, who are the main
purveyors of white supremacist violence in our cities. Why is armed po-
lice protection nonviolent?
Nonviolence as a philosophy is ultimately not about reducing vio-
lence or increasing peace; it is about purifying the activist, about clean-
ing their hands. Nonviolence means outsourcing the power you need to
meet your objectives to the police or to federal marshals—in other words,
to the state. It means disavowing that power, not actually destroying it.
Nonviolence is a tactic based in keeping current distributions of power
in place.
As a result, in the last analysis, nonviolence is structured around vic-
tim blaming and anti-Blackness. As Robert F. Williams wrote, “Why do
the white liberals ask us to be non-violent? We are not the aggressors; we
have been victimized for over 300 years! Yet nobody spends money to go
into the South and ask the racists to be martyrs or pacifists. But they al-
ways come to the downtrodden Negroes, who are already oppressed and
too submissive as a group, and ask them not to fight back.”^10


```

Nonviolence puts the entire moral weight of politics onto the backs
of the oppressed. It takes the history of white supremacy and settler colo-
nialism for granted and says that the responsibility for changing the vio-
lent nature of that history lies entirely with the people who are currently
crushed under that violence. But any serious engagement with history
should lead us to see the wisdom in the claim made by Stokely Carmi-
chael (later Kwame Ture) that “responsibility for the use of violence by
black men, whether in self-defense or initiated by them, lies with the
white community.” Black people wouldn’t even be in the United States,
nor, indeed, would there be any United States, were it not for chattel
slavery, white supremacy, and settler colonialism.
Nonviolence turns this historical accounting upside down. As anar-
chist theorist Peter Gelderloos writes, nonviolence advocates often argue
that the state will use militant struggle or armed resistance to “‘justify’
violent repression. Well, to whom is this violent repression justified, and
why aren’t those who claim to be against violence trying to unjustify it?”^11
The nonviolent worldview, focusing entirely on protesters and not on
police, ultimately obscures the responsibilities of the state, racists, and
fascists, because it frames their much more extreme repressive violence
as “natural” and normal. Nonviolence lets the police, and the systems
that they defend, off the hook.
I want to make clear that this discussion is not meant to denigrate
anyone who uses nonviolent tactics in their struggles. Most of the tactics
available and desirable to us fall within the parameters of “nonviolence”:
discussion, education, study, community organizing, mutual aid, protest.
Indeed, it is recognizing the extent of the horrible violence of the state,
capitalism, white supremacy, imperialism, cisheteropatriarchy, and set-
tler colonialism that makes me believe revolution is the only way forward.
But I do not believe that my refusal to attack property, fight physi-
cally, or make a ruckus helps us toward radical change: that refusal does
not lessen the degree to which I benefit from systems of domination. It
may assuage my personal aversion to violence, but history shows that it
ultimately limits my ability to get free. By not lighting fires at a protest, by
not defending myself from police attack, I am not successfully avoiding


182 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

violence. I believe it demonstrates a much deeper complicity with vio-
lence, for example, to let someone be arrested and taken into the carceral
system when I could prevent it, than it is to shove a cop in order to let that
person get away.
And though I don’t believe that we can cleanly separate means from
ends, I also think violence is much too broad and imprecise an idea to
be a metric of tactics in and of itself. There is, in my opinion, no legiti-
mate moral, ethical, or political equivalence that can be made between
the police murdering Freddie Gray and protesters breaking a cop car’s
windows in response, and yet both can be called “violence.” Similarly,
I believe that “nonviolence” has become a bankrupt concept freighted
with moral righteousness but lacking actual content. And without the po-
litical context of the sixties—in particular, the moral imperative created
by victorious anticolonial struggle in Africa and Asia—it is strategically
and tactically bankrupt, too.
The nonviolent activists of the sixties were impossibly brave, acting
with incredible discipline and restraint in the face of massive historical
and physical violence. They did so out of a commitment to freedom and
justice, and we owe them the utmost respect and honor. But most activ-
ists in the sixties also practiced or benefited from armed self-defense, and
many eventually left nonviolence behind. A vast number of participants
in the movement were involved in decidedly not-nonviolent riots and
uprisings.
This more complicated and fluid relationship to the idea of nonvio-
lence has been lost in the intervening years. When we remove the rioters
and rebels from our image of the movement, we fundamentally misun-
derstand the nature of the struggle and ignore the open-minded perspec-
tives and diverse tactics of its activists, who wanted, above all, to get free.

A true liberatory politics is also antipatriarchal, and non-
violence advocates often claim this (indisputable) point is in their fa-
vor, arguing the existence of an inherent link between militant tactics,
machismo, and misogyny. But between the Birmingham riots and the


```

```
lead-up to the March on Washington, during the very height of nonvio-
lent organizing, a number of Black women in the movement, many of
whom had been at the forefront of militant, radical efforts, found them-
selves silenced.
The 1963 March on Washington, the great event in the history of
nonviolence, and perhaps the most iconic moment of the entire struggle,
shows how often nonviolence is actually a collaborationist and misogynist
affair. Malcolm X traced the history of the march in his “Message to the
Grassroots” and, later, in his autobiography. As he records it, the idea of a
March on Washington, which had been present in the movement since
A. Phillip Randolph’s 1941 MOWM, began to percolate again among the
grass roots in the North in 1962.
The march, given shape by Black labor radicals that included Ran-
dolph, was originally planned by people predominantly in the North,
who focused on the intersection of racial and class exploitation. Its origi-
nal goal was to fight against the “economic subordination” of Black peo-
ple. March organizers began working with the heads of other movement
organizations, however, and expanded the definition of the march to in-
clude civil rights struggle: it would become a “March for Jobs and Free-
dom.” At first this only expanded its scope. The march had the support
of the grass roots, and a militant plan emerged. Poor Black people were
going to go down to DC however they could for two days, march on the
Congress and the White House in a series of dispersed direct actions, and
shut down the government.
President John F. Kennedy, just as FDR had twenty years before him,
panicked in the face of the planned attack on the capital, and called a
meeting with the moderate leaders of the civil rights movement, begging
them to stop the march in exchange for concessions. When they told
him that energy for the march was flowing from the bottom up and they
couldn’t stop the event, JFK graciously “authorized” an official march,
which would be headed up, funded, and organized by the fine, middle-
class gentlemen of the leadership and which would end with an official
delegation meeting with the president. In return, the movement’s lead-
ership assured the president that the march, rather than a riotous mob of
the poor descending on the seat of government, would see a polite crowd


184 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

stay on the Mall for only a day—they all left that same evening!—to be
shipped out without doing any damage. It would be nonviolent, racially
mixed, and even the signs and chants would be controlled. Malcolm
called it the “farce on Washington.”^12
This co-optation was intensified by the internal misogyny of the civil
rights organizations. Dorothy I. Height, Pauli Murray, and Ella Baker
record, from their positions within the leadership’s inner sanctum, how
the mainstream leaders were evasive and dismissive when it came to
questions of gender and representation. As the major organizations came
together to plan the big day, women advocated for their place at the po-
dium. Height describes the situation:

```
We women were expected to put all our energies into it. Clearly, there
was a low tolerance level for anyone raising the questions about the
women’s participation, per se.
The men seemed to feel that women were digressing and pulling
the discussion off the main track. . . . It was thought that we were mak-
ing a lot of fuss about an insignificant issue, that we did not recognize
that the March was about racism, not sexism.^13
```
Women were the core organizers of the civil rights movement. Na-
tional organizers like Baker, Parks, Murray, Height, and Septima Clark
did constant, thankless work building organizational infrastructure,
discovering grassroots leaders, and building voting drives and freedom
schools (which taught reading and basic political literacy) in towns all
over the South. Meanwhile, organizers like Gloria Richardson, Daisy
Bates, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ruth Batson, and Amelia Platts Boynton
emerged from their communities to lead the most exciting and militant
local struggles in the country.
But as planning for the March on Washington was coming together,
despite the fact that much of the work for the march itself was being car-
ried out by women, it was made clear that no women were going to be
allowed to speak at the dais. Despite the angry protests of many women
leaders, “the organizers gave a number of us prominent seats on the plat-
form. We were seated. In all the March on Washington pictures, we’re


```
Using Guns Nonviolently 185
```
right there on the platform. There were several women who just refused
to do anything. Some were so angry that they didn’t really want to take
part.”^14
Pauli Murray sums up this anger well: “It was bitterly humiliating for
Negro Women on August 28, to see themselves accorded little more than
token recognition in the historic March on Washington. Not a single
woman was invited to make one of the major speeches or to be part of
the delegation of leaders who went to the White House. The omission
was deliberate.”^15
The patriarchal erasure of these women from the struggle’s most his-
toric moment is of a piece with the anti-militancy of the affair, which at
the last minute refused SNCC’s John Lewis his speaking role until he
removed language promising revolution and criticizing JFK’s civil rights
bill. Patriarchy and anti-militancy are part of the same political program.
These days, however, those who violate absolute nonviolence and
act militantly are often accused of being macho, immature, middle
class, and in league with the police. The fact is, the nonviolent wing
of the movement was most pronounced in its misogyny, most middle
class in its leadership, and most complicit with the state. Whereas the
overwhelming majority of famous figures in the pantheon of the Black
Freedom movement are men, it is Black Power, and in particular the
Black Panther Party (BPP), that is singled out for accusations of misogyny
and machismo.
But the idea that the BPP was particularly misogynistic is simply not
true. At its height, two-thirds of the BPP membership were women. The
vast majority of BPP activities, a wide range of “medical, housing, cloth-
ing, free breakfast and education programs,” were run and organized
by women.^16 It was this work, in support of the armed self-defense, that
J. Edgar Hoover thought made the BPP particularly dangerous, because
with these programs the Panthers could win mass appeal and receive
support from many sectors of society. As Panther Frankye Malika Adams
said, “Women ran the BPP pretty much. I don’t know how it got to be a
male’s party or thought of as being a male’s party.” BPP rallies featured
women standing shoulder to shoulder with men wearing the same uni-
forms. It was, furthermore, the only major organization of the period to


186 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

be publicly led by a woman: Elaine Brown chaired the BPP from 1974 to
1977, and it was one of the only organizations to officially take a position
on women’s liberation.^17 *
This is not to deny or excuse the fact that the BPP was afflicted with
patriarchal and misogynist views and practices we would find objection-
able today (nor to say that there aren’t many of the same problems in our
movements now; they’re just not as explicitly expressed). Women still did
the vast majority of the caring, cooking, and cleaning and were expected
to raise children and do the social services and administrative work while
men were chosen for media appearances and glamorous direct actions.
The BPP traded in macho rhetoric, and Eldridge Cleaver’s best-selling
Soul on Ice, written in 1965 before he was a party member but published
in 1968 and associated widely with the Panthers, has a horrific passage of
rape apology and misogynoir in its opening pages.
But even though these facts are relatively common knowledge about
the Panthers, we rarely, if ever, hear about the rampant misogyny of the
white middle-class peace movement, hippie culture, or the civil rights
mainstream. It is not to deny the misogyny of the party to ask: Why is the
BPP so often singled out for its machismo? I believe that it is partially
because of its mass lower-class character.† But it is also the result of a

*SNCC, the most militant of the civil rights groups and the organization that first de-
clared and popularized Black Power, was founded and coordinated behind the scenes
by Ella Baker, cultivated women leaders like Fannie Lou Hamer, and had women in all
ranks of its leadership. On the other hand, the “cultural nationalist” organizations within
the Black Power tendency, such as Ron Karenga’s US (United Slaves) and the Nation of
Islam, had strongly proscribed positions for women built into an explicitly chauvinistic
ideology of “natural” gender roles. But these organizations were opposed to political
struggle, let alone revolutionary politics, believing instead in individual uplift, Black cap-
italism, and cultural cohesion as the goal. Historically, the less militant or revolutionary
the organization, the less liberatory its gender politics tended to be. This is not without
exceptions and is definitely not an excuse for male revolutionaries to rest on their laurels
and not explicitly struggle against patriarchy within themselves, their communities, and
other organizations. It is, however, reason to question received narratives around mili-
tancy and machismo.
†The poor, less sophisticated at hiding their patriarchal opinions and more frequently
punished for their violence, are always accused of greater misogyny than the rich and
middle classes, who can more easily keep their violence behind closed doors and who
organize and systematize their patriarchy through fraternities, business clubs, family life,
sexual control of employees and staff, and other such strategies.

general attempt to connect militancy to masculine posturing—a percep-
tion not always discouraged by male activists—in order to discredit not-
nonviolent tactics.
Not-nonviolent tactics are not just decried as macho, however; they
are often treated as evidence of “provocateurs.” The supposed moral su-
periority of nonviolence, and the connected belief that “violence” is what
the state wants us to do, often sees liberals and well-meaning activists
accuse anyone who escalates conflict of being a government agent at-
tempting to discredit the movement. This acts as a direct brake on street
action and serves to unnecessarily divide us in the streets.
Is it any surprise, then, that in many public schools and public ac-
counts, the Black Power movement, if taught at all, is viewed as a mili-
tant error, an excessive overreaction, while the civil rights movement is
reduced to King’s “I Have a Dream” speech given at the march? That
march was the product of a series of sellouts and silencings, of nonviolent
leaders dampening the militancy of the grass roots, of middle-class leaders
taking control of a working-class movement, of government-sanctioned
protest replacing mass insurgency, of men taking credit for the work of
women. That the march was an inspiring and historic moment cannot
be denied—but it was also mostly a symbolic one, one that sapped move-
ment energy and focused it into a daylong rally. It is not militancy but
nonviolence that truly helps the state.

chapter eight (^) | CIVIL RIOTS
T
hough incredibly important, the winning of national civil
rights legislation and legal desegregation through these most visible
campaigns in the South was not the apex of the movement’s power or
achievements. The fall of Jim Crow prepared the terrain for a more rad-
ical restructuring of American society—it was, in many ways, only the
opening part of the struggle. However, history does not unfold like a book,
and we must also push against the idea that the movement simply grew
progressively stronger and more radical until it climaxed in the Black
Panther Party and various revolutionary tendencies of the late sixties and
early seventies. Following the premise that looting represents an incred-
ibly powerful tactic in the revolutionary strike against white supremacy
allows us to focus on the string of hundreds of urban riots from 1964 to
1968 as an escalation of the movements already in progress, an escalation
that most acutely demonstrated the extent and breadth of white suprem-
acy and offered the most prolonged and successful attack upon it.
Otherwise, the riots and uprisings that explode onto the scene in the
Northeast in 1964 seem inexplicable or somehow related only negatively
to the Southern movement: If the country was really experiencing a trans-
formation of race relations, why were things still so bad in the North?


190 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Whereas de jure segregation may have been a Southern thing, de facto
segregation through redlining, public schools, and racist unions and hir-
ing practices was no less prevalent in the North. Protests for housing,
employment, and educational justice were widespread in this period; for
example, in the years preceding the Watts rebellion, 250 civil rights pro-
tests took place in LA.
And it wasn’t just legislative victories these protests achieved: rioting
won huge concessions in the form of cash and programs, federal funding
that flowed into cities and ghettos through the seventies. This cash nei-
ther solved the problems the riots fought against nor survived the right-
ward swing, neoliberal cuts, and restructuring that started in the eighties.
But it is still a significant historical fact of the period, and one that is often
disconnected from the “movement” proper.
What else shifts in the narrative of the Black Freedom movement
if you focus on the urban riots rather than the more formal movements
surrounding them? I do this not because I believe that the major riots
of the 1960s are the only or even the most important component of the
movement. But in most histories the riots themselves, which make up a
huge and crucial part of the experience of the people who fought for their
freedom, tend to be narrative blank spaces.
Carefully investigated contemporaneous sociological studies and gov-
ernment reports, such as the McCone and Kerner Commissions reports,
tended to treat riots primarily as “outbursts,” reflex actions responding
mechanically to the tragic conditions of the ghetto. Focused on discov-
ering riots’ causes in order to prevent future occurrences through fed-
eral government action, these studies decontextualize the riots from the
broader movement. They instead portray riots as resulting from the ex-
istence of pathological communities and criminal depravity and defined
by poverty, broken families, and general social collapse. Riots were seen
as criminal, and the explosion of riots all over the country was explained
as a kind of “infection” spreading senselessly through imitation and des-
peration. If, following Christina Sharpe, anti-Blackness is the weather,
then these riots appear as hurricanes or flash floods, a terrible fact of the
climate that must be accommodated, against which infrastructure (po-


```
Civil Riots 191
```
lice, prisons, insurance, national guards, curfews, deescalating “leaders”)
must be built but about which nothing can be done.^1
Even in excellent, vital histories that reject the pull of this anti-Black
narrative, riots are often treated like signposts, objective markers of racial
tensions. They are treated as a natural and naturalized fact rather than as
serious and focused bursts of grassroots movement, organization, struggle,
and rebellion. But these riots often manifested as crucial moments that
molded activists, radicalized masses, and transformed the movement’s
trajectory.

Despite the national and historical focus on the March on
Washington, it was the preceding struggle in Birmingham, the “duel of
rocks and fire hoses,” that pointed in the major direction the movement
was headed. Through 1963 and 1964, as movements proliferated across
the South—including the incredibly important grassroots organizing of
the Mississippi Freedom movement, whose 1964 defeat at the Demo-
cratic National Convention would convince most SNCC activists that
there was no future for them in federal politics or the Democratic Party—
urban rebellions also began to pop off, including the early rebellions in
Cambridge, Maryland.^2
I’m not surprised if you haven’t heard of Gloria Richardson and the
Cambridge, Maryland, civil rights struggle she led; I hadn’t until I re-
searched this book. But considering her fame during the movement, we
absolutely should have known about her. Richardson “received nearly
daily front-page coverage in local and national newspapers in 1963 and
1964.” And yet, “Gloria Richardson and the Cambridge Movement were
not mentioned by the authors of the leading studies of the Civil Rights
Movement.”^3
Cambridge is a picturesque seaside town, geographically isolated
from the mainland of Maryland. In the fifties and sixties, its Black in-
habitants were desperately poor. As in so many towns across the coun-
try with large Black populations, in the wake of the 1960 student sit-in


192 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

movement—and further influenced by a Freedom Ride that came to
Cambridge in 1961—civil rights organizing began to grow in Cambridge.
At the age of thirty-nine, Gloria Richardson, the respectable manager of
a local pharmacy, was voted leader of the Cambridge Nonviolent Action
Committee (a local branch of SNCC), the organization at the center of
the Cambridge movement.
The Cambridge movement started with sit-ins against business seg-
regation, but its demands always included economic justice as well, in
particular, economic justice related to poor housing and hiring oppor-
tunities. The movement was incredibly active. At its height from 1962
to 1964, Cambridge activists “regularly sat-in at movie theaters, bowling
alleys, restaurants, and other public places; marched in the streets of
Cambridge; picketed downtown businesses; wrote letters to newspaper
editors; and occasionally responded to violent attacks with violence of
their own.”^4 But it was the last fact that made Richardson (and her move-
ment) both famous and a kind of pariah.
Richardson and the Cambridge movement openly disavowed non-
violence, choosing to fight back against white racists who attacked their
sit-ins, pickets, and marches. On June 12, 1963, protests turned into full-
fledged rioting, with Molotov cocktails and shootouts between Black
activists and white racists and police. The National Guard was sent in
and would remain in Cambridge for months. Nevertheless, Richardson
refused to disavow the riot or her participation in it.* Nor should she

*Richardson was also controversial for her anti-elections stance. In an attempt to buy off
the movement, the Cambridge town government put a desegregation bill up for refer-
endum. But Richardson “opposed this measure because she believed that equality had
already been guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.” She pointed to the fact that many in
her movement were Korean War vets—they had already earned the right to vote by fight-
ing for the United States. “In addition, Richardson pointed out . . . that African Amer-
icans in Cambridge had been participating in elections for nearly one hundred years
and it had not significantly changed the quality of their life.” She argued this directly
against the NAACP, Adam Clayton Powell, Robert Kennedy, and MLK. On her advice,
the Black community boycotted the vote and refused to legitimize the local government.
This move kept the movement in the streets and kept it focused on its core principles of
economic justice, jobs, homes, and food for all. A year later, when the Voting Rights Act
made desegregation the law of the land anyway, she was proven right not to have traded
a street movement for such concessions (Jeff Kisseloff, Generations on Fire: Voices of
Protest from the 1960s, an Oral History [Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 2007]).

have, because their tactics worked: the Cambridge movement was wildly
successful, winning desegregation of transportation, schools, the library,
the hospital, and other public accommodations within a year. They
demonstrated, even more clearly than Monroe, the continuities between
fighting for civil rights and economic justice and between protest and
violent insurrection.
Cambridge also shows that urban riots were hardly a Northern phe-
nomenon: the first two famous ones in the movement, after all, took place
in Birmingham and Cambridge. A riot had broken out a year earlier, in
1962, in Kinloch, Missouri, a small suburb of St. Louis, after police killed
a Black teenager, with another in North St. Louis in June 1964. A riot in
Jacksonville, Florida, in the spring of 1964 gained nationwide attention,
because Black students attacked police and vigilantes with rocks. But these
uprisings are not always included in histories of 1960s urban riots, which
traditionally begin in the North with the famous Harlem Riot of 1964.
That riot began on July 16 after police killed a fifteen-year-old boy,
James Powell, shooting him down in the streets. CORE had planned a
rally in Harlem that day for three civil rights activists whose disappear-
ance in Mississippi was provoking national outrage: James Chaney, Mi-
chael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman.† At the last minute, CORE
changed the subject of the rally to justice for James Powell and against
police brutality. This is a crucial moment of continuity and connection.
The struggle against Jim Crow and white violence, for civil rights and
economic justice, in North and South directly transformed—through lit-
erally the same demonstrations, infrastructure, and organizations—into
urban rebellions, rebellions that would bring the United States seem-
ingly to the edge of revolution by 1968.
Because that day in July 1964 people didn’t just want to rally. They
marched and then ran through the streets, fought with police, smashed

†The three activists had gone south to participate in SNCC’s Mississippi Freedom Sum-
mer, but they had been arrested by Mississippi police and then turned over to the KKK
and lynched. Their disappearance was a huge news item all summer and focused the
nation’s eyes on Mississippi’s horrific violence. Their bodies were found at the end of the
summer, and only decades later would the real story of police and KKK collusion come
out, though it was widely suspected at the time.

store windows, and lit fires. Rioting lasted for two nights when no charges
were brought against the cop, at which point Brooklyn CORE called
a rally in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a neighborhood in north Brooklyn. That
rally also turned into a riot. For six nights total, fighting with police, loot-
ing, and arson spread across Harlem and Bed-Stuy.
Inspired by the events in New York and sparked by local outrages, up-
risings against white supremacist police violence ran rampant across the
country. First upstate to Rochester, New York, then across the Hudson to
Jersey City. The next riots also took place in New Jersey, first in Paterson,
then Elizabeth. A riot popped off in Dixmoor, a Chicago suburb. Next a
major riot erupted in Philadelphia. All of these riots occurred within six
weeks of each other, July–August 1964.
Activists and revolutionaries participated in and pushed forward
these uprisings. As we’ve seen, CORE called the rallies that began the
New York riots. Martially trained Black Muslims deployed their skills
in the streets, playing a particularly important part in Rochester. Mal-
colm X had just split from the Nation of Islam and, rejecting its pol-
icies of separatism and political disengagement, was in the process of
building an independent, revolutionary Muslim tendency: his followers
were most present in the fighting. Members of the Revolutionary Action
Movement—a Marxist Black nationalist revolutionary group—agitated,
propagandized, and fought as well, particularly in Philadelphia, where
they had a large presence as a result of organizing successfully there for
two years.
Though these riots were sparked by instances of police brutality, riot-
ing isn’t simply a mechanical reaction to police violence: it’s not a knee
unbending beneath a doctor’s hammer. If it were, riots would occur ev-
ery day in every city in the United States. Riots, instead, emerge out of
movement.
Sometimes they come out of that subterranean, invisible but ongoing
movement for freedom, justice, and Jubilee that Karl Marx called the
“historical party” that runs through the entire history of capitalism, reap-
pearing seemingly suddenly and spontaneously (though specific histories
of uprisings always tell a more complicated story of rising local tensions
and grievances). But uprisings occur much more frequently when social

Civil Riots 195
```
movement is highly visible, agitating, and powerful. Riots transform the
consciousness of their participants, widen the group of people taking part
in political action, and usually produce a new generation of revolution-
aries, opening up new directions for further action.

Charles Fuller, who would eventually go on to win the Pu-
litzer Prize for drama, was a young writer just starting his career when
the Philadelphia uprising occurred. In the important Black arts news-
paper The Liberator, he described walking through town the morning
after the riot began. His essay captures beautifully the transformations of
consciousness created by these uprisings. Rather than frightening him
and making him feel unsafe, the riot flipped the normal racial order, and
its distribution of safety and violence, on its head: “Then you slow down,
and stop in front of the first store whose windows haven’t been smashed,
and you read the sign: ‘this is a black woman’s store!’ and somehow
you feel good. You tell yourself again, you are safe because you are black.”
He experiences “an unbelievable courtesy” as he walks through the
streets, a feeling of solidarity and mutual respect: “Maybe it’s the tension,
maybe it’s the power the people feel they possess, but no black man is
discourteous to another black man. Somehow, in this sea of black faces it
no longer becomes necessary to fear one another.” This experience of dis-
appearing fear and rising strength and cohesion is described everywhere
riots happened across the period and is described today in the wake of
antipolice riots. That particular feeling takes months to fade, and most
who experience it remember it their whole lives. Many become activists,
revolutionaries, or otherwise socially active. Dozens of social, cultural,
and political groups and groupings pop up to carry that feeling forward.
Within the atmosphere produced by riots, looting then functions to
tie that sense of community to a questioning of the historical ties of white
supremacy, property, and the law. “You go past a ‘Fish-Fry’ joint where
some drunken broad in her fifties steals a white cooking apron and walks
away satisfied. You ask more questions, and you tell yourself unbeliev-
ingly that she just wanted a souvenir, and you realize there is more than


196 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

that going on inside her, that somehow she has lashed out at every white
store owner on the Avenue, has gotten back all the hurt she suffered; you
quickly dismiss this idea, and call her a thief.”^5
Reducing looting and rioting to a question of crime, calling the
looter “just a thief,” as Fuller ironically suggests, serves to mask the lib-
eratory content of the action taking place.^6 In the midst of the uprising,
onlookers and participants alike begin to question the ideology support-
ing property and commodity, order and law. As such, looting represents a
fundamental threat to a society ordered by white supremacy, a threat that
often goes beyond the boundaries that activists or even self-proclaimed
revolutionaries feel comfortable with.
These riots all came immediately after the passage of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, which finally, legally declared the end of segregation. The
Harlem Riots took place only fourteen days afterward. As liberals de-
clared victory, and an end to racial discrimination, Black people north
and south called bullshit.
But the riots did more than just express a voice. Riots are more than
just the “language of the unheard,” as MLK called them. Riots give
birth to revolutionary transformation. The three largest riots of the pe-
riod, Watts, Newark, and Detroit, created three different but powerful
revolutionary movements in their wake, each indicating the degree to
which riots expand and empower political consciousness and action, and
the three together demonstrating how they can do so in unpredictable
directions.

The tension between liberal declarations of victory over
racism and the real lived experience of Black people in America exploded
into full contradiction with the Watts Uprising in LA. The passage of the
Voting Rights Act, on August 6, 1965, was widely described as a revolution
in race relations, an epochal victory of the civil rights movement. Five
days later, on August 11, something that looked like an altogether different
kind of revolution broke out.


```
Civil Riots 197
```
That afternoon, twenty-one-year-old Marquette Frye was pulled over
by a California Highway Patrol officer not far from his house in South
LA. In the passenger seat was his younger brother Ronald, just home
from the Air Force. As Marquette was interrogated outside the car, a
crowd gathered, mostly watching and cracking jokes. Ronald ran home
to get their mom, Rena, who arrived and began berating Marquette for
drunk driving. A second cop car arrived. Those officers began to harass
and yell at the Fryes. One officer bashed Marquette on the head with a
baton. Rena jumped forward at him, and an officer slapped her, twisted
her arm behind her back, and handcuffed her. Another beat Marquette
and arrested him. The crowd jeered as all three were beaten, stuffed in
the back of cop cars, and driven away. As news and rumors of the beatings
spread, people poured into the streets in protest.
What followed was six days of “insurrection against all authority,” as
the local CBS radio station reported it. “If it had gone much further,”
the news report said, “it would have become civil war.”^7 More than 950
buildings were damaged, and 260 were totally destroyed. Looting and
property destruction amounted to over $40 million in damages—nearly
$330 million today adjusted for inflation.
But the destruction was hardly wanton or senseless. Almost no homes,
schools, libraries, churches, or public buildings were even partially dam-
aged. The use of arson was strategic and controlled. The majority of
Black-owned businesses were not looted, nor were those businesses that
were seen as dealing fairly with the community. Signs went up saying
“Black-owned” or “soul brother” and the like, which would (usually) pro-
tect a shop from rioters. On the other hand, businesses that had tradition-
ally exploited people, in particular pawnshops, check-cashing stores, and
department stores that operated aggressively on credit, went up in flames.
Credit records were usually destroyed before anything else took place.
Brave rioters even made attacks on police stations; one was set alight.
The tactics were simple but effective, as Gerald Horne records in his
important history of the Watts Uprising, Fire This Time. One common
tactic saw a group of rioters, usually young men, drive up to a business,
hop out, break out the windows, then drive away. Then cars of looters,


198 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

a much more mixed group, split between men and women, young and
old, would arrive and work to empty the store. The store would only be
set alight once credit records had been destroyed and goods had been
fully looted. Rioters usually remained nearby to make sure the building
burned, attacking firemen with bricks and bottles if they tried to put out
the flames before the fire had fully consumed the hated business.^8
Tactics reflected effective communication and mobility among
the rebels. Rioters transmitted information over the radio waves, used
payphones to spread intel, and listened in to police broadcasts to see
where cops would be deployed. False reports were called in to send po-
lice scrambling, at which point areas they’d just “pacified” could be re-
taken. In areas they didn’t entirely control, rioters focused on hit-and-run
strikes, then dispersing quickly to reappear elsewhere. All of these tactics
would be adopted and practiced, with local modifications, in other riots
throughout the period.
The media described these as guerilla tactics, and police and reac-
tionaries compared the situation in Watts to fighting the Viet Cong or
the Mau Mau of Kenya. Rioters often appreciated the comparison: many,
encouraged by the thought of Malcolm X, Revolutionary Action Move-
ment (RAM), Robert F. Williams, and local militants, understood their
actions as guerilla warfare, too. Other rioters tied their actions to antico-
lonial struggle via resistance to imperialist war. Many men of draft age
interviewed afterward said something very similar to what one rioter told
SNCC newspaper The Movement: “I’d rather die here than in Vietnam.”^9
The predominantly white, middle-class, university-based antiwar
movement failed, however, to see the crucial anti-Vietnam dimension of
the riots, and therefore failed to form unity with rioters, which it might
have done by creating defense committees or solidarity demonstrations.
The Vietnam War and the movement against it were ramping up across
the years of the urban rebellions, and this connection might have helped
transform the antiwar movement in a truly revolutionary direction. Rather
than listen to or organize with rioters, all but the most radical tended to
see Watts only as a “race thing,” failing to understand the links among
revolution, antiracism, and anti-imperialism—links that had been at the


```
Civil Riots 199
```
forefront of Black radical theorizing for decades and that were increas-
ingly spreading through the Black Freedom movement at large.
Only too late, once the riots had mostly subsided after 1968, did
large sections of the antiwar movement recognize these connections.
This same fatal reactionary error is being made today by members of the
social- democratic Left who say focusing on race (or “identity politics”)
is wrong, that we should focus instead on class. They fail to recognize
the degree to which Black Freedom struggles are already about class and
race, something they would realize if they simply listened to the people
taking part in those struggles.
As in Philadelphia, the action in Watts greatly increased feelings of
strength and unity. As Jimmy Garrett recorded in The Movement: “The
unity came out in the words ‘Burn baby burn.’ It expressed itself Friday
night on 42nd street and Avalon boulevard when a young Negro stood in
front of a Negro business shouting ‘Don’t bother this one, He’s a brother.
He’s a brother.’ It showed when another young Negro politely asked a
woman her size, then stepped through a broken window of a dress shop
to pick out ten or twelve dresses. It was seeing people with their heads up
and smiles on their faces.”^10
Not some dour, grim thing, Watts, like most major riots, took on a
carnivalesque, celebratory atmosphere. Participation was widespread.
Gerald Horne quotes one report that said one in seven residents of the
affected area took part. The Kerner Commission, formed to study the
riots of 1967, indicates that 18 percent, or nearly one in five residents, par-
ticipated in those urban uprisings. Not some tiny cabal of troublemakers,
rioters were the community: those numbers mean nearly everyone had an
active participant in either their family or among their friends.
The cops, for their part, practiced vicious collective punishment on
Black people. The first thing the police did when looting broke out was
deploy to protect the banks, which they prioritized over pawnshops full
of guns and even their own precinct houses. After the second day, the
governor declared a curfew, enabling police to carry out mass arrests
of anyone on the streets. On top of police, fourteen thousand national
guardsmen were sent into the curfew zone. Two days after rioting ended,


200 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

on August 18, LAPD attacked the Nation of Islam mosque in Watts—the
most visible symbol of Black organization in the ghetto—firing hundreds
of rounds into the mosque, absolutely riddling it with bullets. It was a
miracle they killed no one, although they injured a number of nation
members, mostly with flying glass shards.
Over the course of the riots, 3,438 people were arrested, the vast ma-
jority of them with no criminal record. Over 1,000 people were injured,
mostly civilians beaten or shot by police forces. And 34 people died, all
but 3 of them civilians killed by LAPD or National Guard, while the
remaining three included a firefighter killed by a falling wall and two
police officers killed by friendly fire.
Most of those killed were shot for looting. But all the police and Na-
tional Guard murders were ruled justifiable homicides. As Horne writes,
reviewers “were not concerned about the propriety—legal and other-
wise—of a shoot-to-kill procedure directed at unarmed suspects in the
midst of committing what were arguably misdemeanors.”^11 Property is
always valued over life, particularly Black life, in this society. But in the
liberated, carnival atmosphere of the riot, the enjoyment of everything
by everyone—looting—overturns this logic. The celebration of freedom
and life overcomes all notions of law, property, and commodity. Police
make looting a capital offense in a riot precisely to reassert their system
of values. The media, police chain of command, judiciary, and local and
federal governments all support them: this is the essence of their job.
Killing for property is restoring order, because worship of property at the
expense of Black death is what American order is.
The LAPD had already earned its reputation as one of the most vio-
lent, racist, and out-of-control police forces in the world before the riots.
In the wake of the Watts Uprising, rather than trying to improve their
relations with the community—police brutality started the riot and was
one of the main issues cited by rioters, after all—the LAPD increased its
military capacity and developed more explicitly counterinsurgent forces.
All police “innovations” come in response to struggles and uprisings by
the people, because it is these uprisings that police exist to destroy. The
LAPD instituted constant helicopter flyovers, “eye-in-the-sky” policing,


```
Civil Riots 201
```
which persists today, and introduced a comprehensive computerized
control center for tactical domination of all of LA.
The most famous result of this is the SWAT—special weapons and
tactics—team. These famous paramilitary police squads developed in LA
in response to the riots. But they were introduced on the national stage
when they first went into action in a 1969 standoff and raid of the offices
of another major organizational legacy of the riots, the Black Panther
Party.
The Watts rebellion helped launch Black nationalism and more mil-
itant revolutionary Black politics into the mainstream. Polls showed that
after Watts, “civil rights” replaced Vietnam as the number one political
concern of Americans.
In LA, the riots led to creation of the Black Congress, an umbrella
organization brought together from a series of Black nationalist and revo-
lutionary organizations. These groups, most of them formed and all grow-
ing exponentially in the wake of the riots, included Ron Karenga’s United
Slaves (US Organization); the Community Alert Patrol, which developed
armed patrolling of the police, which would become the founding prin-
ciple and practice of the Black Panther Party; the Black Student Alliance,
a variety of civil rights and antiwar groups; and a Revolutionary Action
Movement–led Black Panther Party chapter.*
Most of the revolutionary organizations and activists in LA in the fol-
lowing years passed through the Black Congress. A yearly Black national-
ist arts festival was organized to keep the spirit of Watts alive, and the street
gangs that took part in the riots declared a truce, many of them reorganiz-
ing as the radical Sons of Watts, most of whom would later become Black
Panther Party cadre. Two months after the uprising, rioters and activists
turned an abandoned furniture store into the Watts Happening Coffee

*This party was not originally connected to the Black Panther Party for self-defense that
emerged in Oakland, California. Both groups independently took their name from the
Mississippi Black Panther Party, led by Stokely Carmichael, which emerged in 1966.
The LA group was largely led by RAM militants, but it would eventually be subsumed
by the Oakland BPP, a final moment in the collapse of RAM power and influence; the
group was largely defunct by 1967.

House, a gallery and performance space that became a major center of
both artistic and revolutionary practice in LA. The LAPD, of course, did
everything it could to arrest, harass, infiltrate, and destroy this flourishing
movement of working-class culture and democracy.
But Watts was incredibly important state- and nationwide, and its
most famous child is probably the Black Panther Party. BPP members took
their uniform—black pants, leather jackets, and dark turtlenecks—from
Watts rioters. But the connection went much deeper. In Revolutionary
Suicide, BPP founder Huey Newton begins a chapter on the formation
of the party with an analysis of Watts. As he wrote, he and cofounder
Bobby Seale “had seen Watts rise up the previous year. We had seen how
the police attacked the Watts community after causing the trouble in the
first place. We had seen Martin Luther King come to Watts in an effort to
calm the people, and we had seen his philosophy of nonviolence reject-
ed.”^12 It was this, combined with the increasing violence of the Oakland
PD, that led them to conceive of and create the party in 1966.
And Watts remained a touchstone of BPP analysis. As Newton said
in a speech called “The Correct Handling of a Revolution,” rioting like
Watts was politically powerful because it could not be reinterpreted nor
easily recuperated by the press. In Watts, “the economy and property of
the oppressor was destroyed to such an extent that no matter how the
oppressor tried in his press to whitewash the activities of the Black broth-
ers, the real nature and cause of the activity was communicated to every
Black community.”^13 The Panthers aimed to produce similarly unambig-
uous actions through both their armed actions and their powerful com-
munity programs.*
But the uprisings also gave the BPP its potential base and its sense
of purpose. As Elaine Brown, chairman of the BPP for three years, ex-

*The range of programs was immense. They “eventually included the Free Breakfast
for Children Program, liberation schools, free health clinics, the Free Food Distribu-
tion Program, the Free Clothing Program, child development centers, the Free Shoe
Program, the Free Busing to Prison Program, the Sickle Cell Anemia Research Founda-
tion, free housing cooperatives, the Free Pest Control Program, the Free Plumbing and
Maintenance Program, renter’s assistance, legal aid, the Seniors Escorts Program, and
the Free Ambulance Program” (Joshua Bloom and Waldo Martin, Black Against Empire
[Berkeley: University of California Press, 2013]).

plained the party’s purpose, “those rebellions, from Harlem to Watts, had
been endorsed by the entire black underclass, shouting ‘Hallelujah.’ The
party intended to educate and politicize that mass of energy, creating
vanguard soldiers from the hard core and a mass of black people ready
for revolution.”^14
The Watts (and other) riots demonstrated to the BPP that the time
was right for a revolutionary party, an organization with an explicitly not-
nonviolent philosophy and one aimed toward total social transformation.
The Panthers’ strategy was based on directly organizing the poor, the
unemployed, the socially marginalized, and the criminal gangs of the
ghetto into a revolutionary party. This may seem to make their politics
a “natural” fit with riots, which we are taught to incorrectly presume
are carried out by the most isolated, alienated, and criminalized in so-
ciety. But it was hardly the only form of organization born in the flames
of looted department stores. In Newark, a movement focused on gain-
ing local political power and pushing cultural and social transformation
through control of existing city structures—a favorite dream of reformers
and those revolutionaries who disdain insurrection—rose out of a mas-
sive riot’s ashes. A few weeks later, insurrection in Detroit gave birth to
a radical labor movement, precisely the kind of movement that many
“socialists” who condemn rioters claim they would support.

By the time Newark went up in flames, on July 12, 1967, riots
had seemingly become a fact of American life. “In 1964, 15 urban rebel-
lions shook the country; in 1965 there were 9; in 1966: 38; in 1967, 128.”^15
People talked about the “long, hot summers” of riots; they were the new
normal. The political temperature in America was rising.
Civil rights struggles continued to move in the streets, including
fights for welfare, tenants’ rights, school busing, sanitation, electoral
representation, and many other issues, large and small. But despite the
passage of civil and voting rights acts, conditions on the ground were
changing only slowly in the South. SNCC organizing grew increasingly
militant, and nonviolent marchers in Mississippi and Louisiana were now


204 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

protected by an openly armed movement bodyguard, the Deacons for
Defense. During one march in 1966, Stokely Carmichael and marchers
proclaimed their goal was “Black Power!” The motto spread like wildfire
across the country, giving a name to the growing militancy and terrifying
white liberals, most of whom were showing their true colors and turning
away from the movement.
While SNCC deepened the struggle in the South, Martin Luther
King’s SCLC moved north. There they found that although economic
and housing discrimination created much the same conditions as in
the South, nonviolent marches were much less effective. When MLK
marched in Chicago, unlike in small Southern towns, thousands of white
supremacists could come out to a counterprotest, an incredibly threaten-
ing and disempowering experience. Mayor Richard Daley also demon-
strated the anti-movement efficacy of Northern Democratic politicians,
as he appeared publicly to negotiate and accept movement demands
while actually stonewalling on all but the most minor concessions.
As a result of these experiences, MLK grew increasingly radical and
pessimistic about reform. He began believing that Black people were
“integrating into a burning house” and that a more fundamental, social-
ist transformation of society was required. By 1967, he was arguing for
radical, fundamental change, because “only by structural change can
current evils be eliminated, because the roots are in the system rather
than in man or faulty operations.” As he would put it in a speech in 1967:
“It didn’t cost a penny to deal with lunch counters and integrate lunch
counters. It didn’t cost the nation one penny to guarantee the right to
vote. . . . It is much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to erad-
icate slums.”^16 The country wasn’t willing to do the latter, and, as more
and more activists recognized the fact, they started proclaiming their al-
legiance to revolution.
Those in power were forced into giving concessions, and they did
so with money: federal funding to cities, towns, and social initiatives in-
creased dramatically. Liberals hoped to mitigate the effects of rioters’
victory by buying off the rioters’ allegiance, producing government pro-
grams that would co-opt and contain activist energy, bringing their grass-
roots organizing effort into working for government programs, as their


```

predecessors had done with the New Deal. This had partially worked in
1963 and 1964, when CORE and SNCC activists in the South focused
their efforts on voter registration despite the fact that locals consistently
wanted them to tackle economic issues; they were receiving much of
their funding from Democratic Party organs anxious to keep their hold
on the South, and so kept the focus on elections.
President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s attempts to tackle the racial and
economic crises of the period, his War on Poverty and Great Society pro-
grams, were despised by white reactionaries, while in radicalized poor
and Black communities they were recognized as insufficient and ineffec-
tive Band-Aids. In most cities, War on Poverty programs just increased
funding to existing infrastructure, thus doubling down on education,
youth, and job training programs that were already failing Black ghetto
residents. Mired in bureaucratic problems, based in an analysis that
saw both unrest and racial discrimination as crime—which is to say, as
problems caused by individuals—Johnson’s programs couldn’t offer the
fundamental transformation and empowerment the movement pointed
toward. And anyway, the cost of the War on Poverty paled in compar-
ison to the cost of the war on the impoverished people of Vietnam; as
many activists pointed out at the time, imperialist war in Vietnam kept
the ghetto poor.
The lead-up to the Newark uprising was marked by conflict around
all these problems. Increasing grassroots activity and increasing aware-
ness of the limits of political participation marked the years before the
riots in Newark. From 1965, Black women, as they always do, had taken
the lead in organizing, pushing for maximum benefit from the new War
on Poverty programs. They tried to take control of the local Area Boards
that distributed funds, they educated their neighbors and communities
on how to apply for grants and foundations, and they built programs for
housing stock improvement, social centers, and other such projects. But
all of this required constant, exhausting struggle with the government
bureaucracy, struggle that often failed to achieve activists’ goals.
There was also an ongoing, powerful antipolice movement in New-
ark, which had organized massive rallies and memorials for Black resi-
dents murdered by police. Only a few weeks before the uprisings, police


206 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

on the East Orange–Newark border had raided, fought with, and arrested
Nation of Islam militants, increasing tensions. And Amiri Baraka and
his Spirit House group were transforming and politicizing the culture of
Newark with Black nationalist poetry readings and street theater, perfor-
mances that not only featured political themes but also became, them-
selves, rallies and protests.*
It is in this context that Newark police ruthlessly beat and arrested
cab driver John Smith on the night of July 12, 1967, setting off six days of
massive rioting. The police and National Guard killed 24 people. “More
than 1,100 sustained injuries; approximately 1,400 were arrested; some
350 arsons damaged private and public buildings; millions of dollars of
merchandise was destroyed or stolen; and law enforcement expended
13,326 rounds of ammunition.”^17 As in Watts, the people held the initia-
tive on the first few days, after which point massive violence, collective
punishment, and repression on the part of police and the National Guard
began to win the struggle.
Looting was massive and organized. The rioters used Molotov cock-
tails in attacks on police and property. A few months before the riots, an
anonymous pamphlet had circulated with instructions on how to make
them. Despite this militancy, though, the rioting in Newark was experi-
enced as a massive party. Indeed, “on a profound level, the gleeful spirits
of the riot crowds disturbed public officials as much as the prospect of
violence. When Newark’s police director Dominick Spina toured the riot
scene with Mayor Addonizio and Governor Hughes . . . Hughes was said
to have been particularly ‘appalled at the holiday air he felt in the ghet-
to.’”^18 The experience of pleasure, joy, and freedom in the midst of a riot,
an experience we almost never have in these city streets where we are
exploited, controlled, and dominated, is a force that transforms rioters,
sometimes forever: the experience of such freedom can be unforgettable.
And it was movement people fighting in the streets. The riots kicked
off after demonstrations were organized and CORE activist Robert

*This tradition has been powerfully continued in the current movement by political
prisoner Ceebo Tha Rapper, an LA artist who, after the August 2011 murder of his cousin
Ezell Ford, spearheaded the movement for Ford, writing songs and shooting music vid-
eos about the movement that were themselves staged as protests.

Curvin appealed to crowds outside the precinct house where Smith
was being held. In one of the most infamous moments of the riot, Amiri
Baraka was pulled from a car by police and beaten within an inch of
his life. The people fighting in the streets in Newark were not sudden
opportunists; they had been educated and politicized by years of steady
movement and struggle.
As in Watts and other cities, signs in windows protected Black-owned
businesses from attack, although in Newark this had a sinister twist: in
the final days of rioting, police and National Guard drove through town
shooting out the windows and shooting up the businesses that rioters had
carefully protected. Police again killed on sight for looting, for example,
shooting Billy Furr, twenty-four, in the back, murdering him directly in
front of a reporter and photographer for Life magazine. Furr had been
looting a six-pack of beer; the photos of his murder were seen by millions.
But many were also killed as police, “fighting against snipers,” fired
indiscriminately into apartment buildings and homes. Though some
people in Newark fired guns at the police, these shots were much less
widespread than reported. Where shooting did occur, it tended to be
warning or pot shots, fired to keep police and firemen away from areas of
looting and arson.
Still, media, police, and national guardsmen hysterically circulated
the idea of sniping to justify collective punishment. Across the riots of
the period, dozens of people were murdered in their homes by police
and guardsmen firing into apartment buildings “in fear of snipers.” The
chain of command told guardsmen that they were heading into an area
of massive sniping to terrify them and authorize them to murder Black
civilians. The media, embedded as it was in police stations and guard
posts, reported on this “widespread” sniping, thus deepening repressive
forces’ fear on the ground while explaining the repression to the rest of
the country. White supremacist forces always play the victim to justify
their ongoing anti-Black oppression.
But despite the repression, the uprising marked an important turn
for the Newark movement. Its many trends—Black nationalism, Black
arts, antipolice activism, welfare activism, and Black community con-
trol—consolidated and grew into a unified movement for Black Power


208 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

after the riots. The movement’s center formed around the Community
for Unified Newark (CFUN), an umbrella organization that had begun
life as the United Brothers. The United Brothers literally formed as con-
cerned activists gathered at Amiri Baraka’s bedside while he recovered
from the police beating he endured in the riots. As Komozi Woodard
writes, “The Black Power movement rose like Phoenix out of the ashes
of the Newark Rebellion. CFUN came to symbolize the politics born of
the urban uprisings.”^19
Rather than forming a national, militant revolutionary party like the
Panthers, CFUN took a different approach to addressing the political and
economic crises of the ghetto. As Woodard records, CFUN

```
ran candidates for public office, fashioned public policies, advocated
reforms, mobilized huge demonstrations to resist President Richard
Nixon’s political reaction, and, above all, established an elaborate
network of institutions, programs, and business . . . the Spirit House
Movers and Players, for drama and poetry; the African Free School,
for early childhood education; the Black NewArk newspaper, for local
communication; the Unity & Struggle newspaper, for national pol-
itics; Events, Inc., for public relations; Proposals, for development
grants; and Kawaida Towers and the NJR-32 Project Area Committee,
for urban planning and community development.^20
```
The full story of CFUN, and the inspiring struggle for political trans-
formation in Newark, is beyond the remit of this book. But the move-
ment in Newark points to the fact that hardly an instigator of only openly
insurrectionary politics, riots, and uprisings can inspire and expand
movements that are based around predominantly nonviolent commu-
nity campaigns for political, cultural, and social power. There is nothing
“riot- like” about the activities or tactics of CFUN; nevertheless, it was
born as Newark burned. And insurrection in Detroit would move out
of the streets and into the factories, giving birth to one of the last major,
radical US labor movements of the twentieth century.


```
Civil Riots 209
```
Late in the night of July 23, 1967, six days after the smoke had
cleared over the Newark skyline, Detroit police raided an unlicensed
after- hours drinking club (a “blind pig”). Rather than a few drunks, po-
lice were surprised to find more than eighty partiers, celebrating two vet-
erans’ safe return from Vietnam. Rather than disperse the crowd, police
decided to arrest and brutalize them all.
Five days later, 43 people were dead, 1,189 were injured, and 7,200
were in jail; 1,300 buildings were utterly destroyed, and 2,700 businesses
had been looted. Other than the Los Angeles riots of 1992 and the New
York City Draft Riots of 1863, this was the largest riot in American history.
The American auto industry, centered in Detroit, was the engine and
center of American capitalism for the first half of the twentieth century,
and, as is inevitable in major centers of capitalist dynamism and power,
Detroit featured some of the most dramatic social conflict in the coun-
try. The Detroit strike of 1933 and the Flint sit-down strikes in 1936–1937
against General Motors were among the hardest fought in the Great De-
pression. The Detroit race riots of 1943 had been the largest and most
violent of the twentieth century.
But white flight, automation, and deindustrialization meant Detroit
was in trouble by 1967. Detroit and the car industry were no longer the
driving economic power in American society, although it was hard to
recognize this from the inside at first. The full fallout and effects of these
trends would only be recognized in the decades following the riots. (As
a result, white folks have often blamed Detroit’s decline on the riots, de-
spite the simultaneous industrial decline of the entire Midwest.)
It’s not surprising the riots traumatized and terrified the white powers
of Detroit. Unlike in Newark and Watts, where fear of snipers was mostly
unjustified, Detroit saw some actual sniping. The first night they were
deployed, the National Guard indiscriminately fired machine guns from
the street into apartment buildings, claiming they were fighting snipers,
killing nine—none of whom were proven to have weapons. Looters were
shot on sight—a direct order from the National Guard command hier-
archy—and police and guardsmen were caught moving and rearranging
bodies to indicate the people they killed had been looting. In the face
of this violence, snipers started shooting back. Things got so serious in


210 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Detroit that LBJ sent in the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions of the US
Army, which had seen combat in Vietnam. Rolling through Detroit in
tanks and armored personnel carriers, soldiers came straight from mur-
dering Vietnamese people to attack and murder Black Americans.
Many radicals fetishize military-style conflict as the sign of true rev-
olutionary potential. This was especially true of the movements of the
late sixties and early seventies, that all proclaimed armed struggle and
saw the “guerilla” as something of a revolutionary saint. But the revolu-
tionary content of the riots does not lie mainly in these military aspects.
The shooting is a small piece, not the main component of the attack
on white supremacy, the state, property, and the commodity. Whereas
armed self-defense will always be an important part of struggles for liber-
ation, the arms themselves have no magical property to make our move-
ments more serious, more revolutionary, more powerful. The power of
the attack on white settler society is seen instead in the broad lawless-
ness, property destruction, looting, and cop-free zones produced by the
riot and is reflected in the attendant sense of freedom, unity, and radical
safety felt by the rioters.*
Detroit was in full-blown insurrection. Arsonists in Detroit controlled
their fires much less effectively than rebels had in Newark and Watts, as
a strong wind was blowing off Lake Erie throughout the days of the riot.
As a result, fires spread much farther in Detroit, destroying many homes,
not just businesses. But despite this, participation in rioting was truly

*The shooting of a few cops and soldiers may well be necessary in the course of a rev-
olutionary struggle, but the emphasis on snipers by the police and media isn’t merely
a repressive justification strategy; it is also a kind of strategic optimism: the state wants
to face its enemies in a military conflict, not a social one; the state wants to fight an
army, not a mob. Armies, even (perhaps especially) guerilla ones, are shaped around
technical expertise and organization, supply lines/chains and logistics, hierarchy, the
harshest discipline, right to punishment up to and including death, laws of conduct, and
an overarching force of social unification. These are all core factors of a state: any army
must become a functional state in miniature. Thus, even if the revolutionaries win the
war, the state will persevere, merely transferred to more progressive bureaucrats. Real
revolution will have been prevented in the militarization of the conflict, which really
means the bureaucratization of the revolutionaries. This, no doubt, must be one of the
basic lessons of the twentieth-century revolutions and anticolonial victories that in many
places dramatically improved daily life but everywhere failed to revolutionize it.

widespread. In Detroit, as Malcolm McLaughlin records, “the Kerner
Commission’s researchers were surprised that half of the seven thousand
people arrested had never been in trouble with the law before. It seemed
that ‘people who weren’t involved in things’ before were ‘getting involved
in this.’ Even ‘people who are living relatively stable lives’ had become
‘involved in some connection with the disturbances.’”^21
Widespread popular participation by previously uninvolved or un-
radicalized people in mass illegal activity points to the desire for and
possibilities of a more total social transformation that rests within every-
one, not just the already activated, and is one of the vital facts marked by
urban uprisings.
Community leaders and nonviolence advocates appeared on the
scene to try to calm the situation and were rebuffed. US representative
John Conyers was shouted down when he tried to address a crowd, while
MLK, who had been heckled in Watts, was laughed at in Detroit. Non-
violence was utterly rejected by a crowd made up of perhaps 20 percent
of the population: nonviolence as a philosophy had been fully defeated
in the streets. Echoes of this rejection of elite leaders reverberated during
the Ferguson uprising of 2014, when professional de-escalators Al Sharp-
ton and Jesse Jackson, sent in to discipline and shut down the crowds,
were instead booed off stage and out of town.
As in most of these riots, the community was instead led by a core
group of rioters, mostly but not exclusively young men. That “leader-
ship,” however, meant inspiration through direct action rather than a
more traditional sense of the word. Lead rioters would break windows,
knock down doors, throw the first rock, light the first Molotov, or commit
an initial act of looting to “create permission” for the crowd to act sim-
ilarly. Action inspires action, and though those lead rioters were often
organized among themselves, communicating with radios and phones,
heading out to vulnerable spots, and fighting or avoiding police in a sys-
tematic fashion, they did not lead in the sense of giving orders, building
hierarchies, or drawing boundaries.
Detroit was home to one of the foremost theorists of this kind of in-
surrection. Reverend Albert Cleage, who ran the Black nationalist Shrine


212 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

of the Black Madonna, had organized and led what had been to that
point the biggest civil rights march in history. In the spring of 1963, he
and Dr. King marched at the head of 200,000 people through downtown
Detroit—a crowd only surpassed by that of the March on Washington.
But after the March on Washington, and in particular the violence of
Birmingham, Cleage’s thinking took a dramatic, militant turn, and he
began arguing for a “strategy of chaos”—rejecting nonviolence, his strat-
egy called for using retaliatory violence and escalation, increasing the
intensity and spread of riots until demands were met. “We’ll get what
we’re after or we’ll tear it up!” was the strategy’s summation. In the years
leading up to the riots, he was increasingly involved in organizing with
the workers in Detroit factories.
So when the army finally succeeded in putting down the uprising,
political organizers, including Cleage, got to work. As activist-historians
Dan Georgakas and Marvin Surkin write in their seminal Detroit, I Do
Mind Dying:

```
An attempt to organize the power of the Great Rebellion into a polit-
ical force capable of restructuring American society began as soon as
minimal order had been restored by the National Guard and police.
Black-owned newspapers and organizations of black industrial work-
ers began to present a series of programs and revolutionary visions in
sharp contrast to the ideas put forward by the [government and labor
bureaucracy response to the riots, the] New Detroit Committee.^22
```
That organizing first manifested in the collective Inner City Voice,
which published a newspaper of the same name and which “was to be
a positive response to the Great Rebellion, elaborating, clarifying, and
articulating what was already in the streets.”^23 Inner City Voice pushed
forward the cause of the Great Rebellion and its “shopping for free,” re-
ferring to the rebellion as “the general strike of ’67.”
The Voice eventually became DRUM, the Dodge Revolutionary
Union Movement, a Black workers’ organization instigating revolutionary
unionism within the auto industry. Within months of becoming DRUM,


```
Civil Riots 213
```
members had instigated a wildcat strike at Dodge’s biggest plant, Dodge
Main, involving four thousand workers. DRUM (and other revolution-
ary movements in the auto industry) came together to form the League
of Revolutionary Black Workers, which struggled against the bosses and
the United Auto Workers (UAW) alike. The UAW was, like most in the
United States, a racist union—Black workers were completely underrep-
resented in union positions and many unionized shops within the plants
were still entirely white—and the top of the UAW bureaucracy were as
rich as many in the higher ranks of the auto industry and a key part of
the Detroit power structure. The league created a militant labor power
to counter the UAW and fight for real worker control of the factories and
the community.
The League of Revolutionary Black Workers balanced on the cutting
edge of a massive wave of radical labor action: the period of 1967–1974
saw the most yearly strikes and days lost to strike action in the United
States since 1946. For years league members broke down racial barriers in
the auto industry, organized massive strikes, and created a militant labor
culture unseen since the forties, one that merged with the Black radi-
cal tradition and antiracist struggles of the sixties to form a revolutionary
Black labor movement. This movement, too, was born of riots.

Less than nine months after the Detroit riots, Martin Lu-
ther King was assassinated, shot down on a motel balcony in Memphis,
Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Memphis rose up in rebellion. Within a
week, riots had spread to 125 cities, where massive rioting was met with
equally massive deployments of the US Army and the National Guard.
The insurrection in DC got within two blocks of the White House, “and
machine guns were mounted on the Capitol balcony and the White
House lawn. Forty-six people were killed across the country, 2500 were
injured, and it took 70,000 federal troops to restore order.”^24
The April uprisings in 1968, taking place during Holy Week leading
up to Easter, created the largest disorder in America since the Civil War,

yet remain wildly understudied, theorized, or historicized. This silence
on the part of historians, scholars, and activists has been deafening.* The
shock and trauma of King’s murder overshadowed the rebellion that it
caused, and the massive, furious, unorganized, and spontaneous nation-
wide uprising fits neatly into few theories of protest or revolution. Unlike
other riots, perhaps, the fact that it was an act of pure mourning, grief,
and rage made it hard even for its participants to summarize afterward.
Or maybe the riots felt so natural, so immediate, so appropriate, even
those who would normally marvel at their scale fell quiet. Or maybe the
state’s massive project, begun immediately upon his death, of recuperat-
ing the image and meaning of King played an active part in enforcing this
silence, this forgetting, and so the riots are seen more as a simple funerary
reaction than an uprising so fierce the government feared the Capitol
would fall. It is, no doubt, some combination of all of these factors. In any
case, the Holy Week uprisings seemed at the time to be a turning point
in American disorder, and even after the fires had smoldered, revolution
seemed just one more “long, hot summer” away.
King had been in Memphis that spring to assist in radical Black la-
bor organizing there. He had spoken to a crowd of fifteen thousand on
March 18, calling for a general strike. The march he led from that speech
resulted in rioting and looting—even his physical presence no longer
guaranteed nonviolence. But in those last years he had begun to speak
about a socialist transformation of America, and though he wasn’t call-
ing for violent revolution, neither was he chastising or rejecting rioters
anymore.
Unlike the uprisings of the previous summers, the Holy Week riots had
no local instigating incidents of police brutality. Instead, the importance
of Martin Luther King and the decade and a half of Black liberation strug-
gle had pushed the Black community to the point of proto- revolutionary
agitation and organization. People poured out of their houses wherever

*As recently as 2018, in a book on the riots of the 1960s, historian Peter Levy could write
that, beside a single volume written in the immediate aftermath of the riots, these upris-
ings “have received remarkably little attention . . . scholars have virtually ignored them”
(Peter Levy, The Great Uprising [Chelsea, MI: Sheridan Books, 2018], 154).

they were and tore shit up, trying to dismantle the system that murdered
King—the very face of the respectable, peaceful movement the white
power structure claimed it wanted to do business with.
With Dr. King’s death, as Stokely Carmichael put it, “Nonviolence
was dead.” At that point, organizing for the revolution seemed to be the
most realistic way forward. This sense was not purely an American one,
though: the feeling was global. The Cultural Revolution in China was at
its height, and around the world radicals were taking inspiration from the
apparent deepening of the Chinese revolution. Although Che Guevara
had been killed the previous summer in a disastrous guerilla campaign
in Bolivia, where he and his comrades were executed by CIA-backed
forces, he had become a global martyr and symbol of the era. The Cuban
Revolution he helped win was going strong, forming a new pole of radical
leadership distinct from China and the USSR, the latter of which most
revolutionaries in the sixties recognized as a reactionary, capitalist state.
And while many of the revolutionary pan-African and socialist move-
ments were on the back foot in Africa—particularly devastating was the
ousting of Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah in 1966 and the col-
lapse of the revolution in the Congo—others, such as the struggle of the
PAIGC and Amilcar Cabral in Guinea-Bissau, the increasingly success-
ful war for independence in Angola, and the ongoing socialist collectiv-
ization of “Ujamaa” practiced by Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere,
seemed to point to an African continent in the midst of revolution. The
riots of April 1968 in the United States were followed closely in May by
massive riots and a general strike in Paris that almost toppled the gov-
ernment. Salvador Allende would be elected in Chile in 1970 on a wave
of socialist agitation already making itself felt. Meanwhile, the Tet Of-
fensive, launched in January 1968, saw the peasants of North Vietnam
winning a war against the world’s great imperial power.
And so in the wake of the April uprisings, and in light of all these facts,
explicitly revolutionary movements across the country exploded onto
the scene. Following the Black “screaming queens” of the Compton’s
Cafeteria rebellion in 1966, Black trans women again pushed forward
the revolution, leading the Stonewall uprising in New York City in 1969

that gave birth to the queer movement. Within a few years, hundreds
of queer advocacy organizations had sprung up across the country. The
American Indian Movement, formed in the summer of 1968, occupied
Alcatraz Island in San Francisco in November 1969, centering national
attention on their militant demands and the continued colonial genocide
of Indigenous people. The Alcatraz occupation would only be forcibly
evicted by federal troops nineteen months later, and the movement built
strength and power, climaxing in the occupation of Wounded Knee in

1973. The Black Panther Party achieved its meteoric moment of national
prominence from 1968 to 1971. As the state increasingly turned to repres-
sion to tackle these growing movements, the prisons, too, exploded into
organization and action, most famously with the riotous takeover (and
police massacre) at Attica in 1971. That was only one of dozens of prison
uprisings in the period.
    The antiwar movement also radicalized. Students, sometimes armed,
occupied and took over university campuses across the country—this
reached its apotheosis with the National Guard massacre of four pro-
testing students at Kent State on May 4, 1970. The Chicanx wing of the
antiwar movement organized a march under the banner of the Chicano
Moratorium and rioted in East LA in August; police killed four of their
number. Although popular histories sometimes point to the Weath-
ermen—a group of white antiwar radicals who favored pursuing riots,
bombings, and guerilla attacks on the state—they were more exemplary
of a trend than the crazy radicals at the fringes they are usually described
as. It is little remembered now, but the period was one of massive left-
wing terrorism: between January 1969 and the spring of 1970 there were
4,330 bombings in the United States.
    Massive movements emerged from within Chicanx, Asian American,
and Puerto Rican communities—most famous among them the Young
Lords, Asian Americans for Action, and the Brown Berets. Workers or-
ganized an awesome wildcat strike wave from 1967 to 1974, feminism
was transforming awareness across the country as consciousness-raising
groups, books, and demonstrations proliferated, people with disabilities
were organizing and fighting for accessibility and freedom, and a mil-

itant movement of poor mothers was fighting a winning fight for wel-
fare. American soldiers in Vietnam were refusing their orders and killing
their officers at record rates; “fragging” was such a problem that the army
seemed on the verge of total collapse. Everywhere you looked America
seemed ready to explode.
A wide range of movements were thus radicalized and activated by
national Black insurrection and international Third World revolution.
As Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor writes, “When the Black movement goes
into motion, it destabilizes all political life in the United States.”^25 Black
struggle had opened the door for revolutionary movements to blossom
across the country, and it was the riots of 1964–1968 that seemed to indi-
cate that the end of American empire was imminent and that the revolu-
tion only needed to be organized.
But the riots didn’t come back: there were no more long, hot summers.
Without the mass energy and intense threat to the state the riots posed,
white retrenchment and reaction slowly retook control. The COINTEL-
PRO program, run by the FBI and police across the country, would kill
more than twenty Black Panthers and imprison more than a thousand,
would murder dozens of American Indian Movement militants, would
attack, disrupt, and infiltrate the Puerto Rican independence movement
and the radical antiwar groups. Rather than social reform, the United
States built its massive prison system, which grew partially as a way of
guaranteeing the revolutionary movements of the 1960s and 1970s would
not be repeated. Though America lost the Vietnam War, the main lesson
the military learned was that a mass, drafted army in a long, drawn-out
war was too dangerous for morale. So the United States abolished the
draft and developed a volunteer army made up of only the poor and the
patriotic, and it increasingly privatized its military, pointing future US
strategy toward global police action, assassination, and special forces in-
tervention rather than massive ground war.
Without increasing street action, the movements of the late sixties
and seventies fell to repression, fizzled out, or devoured themselves
through splits and infighting. Most of the political gains of the sixties have
since been taken away by generations of “tough on crime” politicians,

Republican and Democrat alike, and the successive crises of the global
capitalist economy, expressing themselves in more and more dramatic
debt bubbles since 1973, have wiped out much of the social progress.
Another revolutionary period ended in defeat. Although many of the
victories have been wiped away, we can resist the suppression and defor-
mation of its history. The centrality of rioting and looting to the period
was intimately understood by its activists, rebels, and revolutionaries. But
their voices have all too often been silenced or co-opted by liberal histo-
rians and conservative politicians.
The question of nonviolence and the efficacy of rioting has once
again been put on the table in Ferguson, Baltimore, Milwaukee, and Ba-
ton Rouge, in Charlotte, Chicago, Oakland, and Minneapolis, in Char-
lottesville, Berkeley, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. We can no longer afford
to misunderstand the sixties, to excise the riots and refuse to recognize
the vital role they played in the upheavals that shook America to its core.
We must do away once and for all with the myth of nonviolence and with
the false moral divisions between uprising and social transformation, be-
tween insurrection and movement, between looting and boycotting, be-
tween rioting and community organization. As Shakur Assata reminds us,
it is our duty to win.

chapter nine (^) | THE INHUMANITY OF LOOTERS
T
he revolution promised in the fires of the long sixties
failed to materialize, and the victories and reforms won proved vul-
nerable to counterattack by state and capitalist alike. The decline of mass
movements was met with a similar decline in the living and working con-
ditions of the masses. However, the movements had broken many of cap-
italism’s favored methods of control at the same moment that capitalism
was running up against important internal limits. So capital, responding
to its own internal crises and the crises caused by decades of upheaval,
changed tack while doing everything it could to co-opt, defang, slander,
and bury once and for all the protagonists of that upheaval. This new
strategic program has often been referred to as “neoliberalism,” and neo-
liberals would begin their five decades of capitalist restructuring while
the embers of the failed revolutionary movement burned out. One of the
tactics in this repressive struggle was the total vilification of the rioter and
the looter.
Capitalism has been in continuous slow-moving crisis since 1973. In
the immediate postwar period, profits and wages in America and in Eu-
rope rose in tandem, as domestic consumerism led to production of more
consumer goods, which led again to more consumption in a virtuous


220 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

cycle. All of this was made possible only by the neocolonial extraction of
raw materials from the Global South. But even with continued imperial
domination, American and European consumerism hit serious limits.
At some point near the end of the “golden years” in the sixties, workers
started saving and investing their money rather than spending it on ever
more elaborate and senseless consumer goods. Meanwhile, the manufac-
turing economies in Japan and Germany had recovered from the rubble
of World War II, providing serious competition for US corporations. Just
as importantly, class struggle was winning victories for workers, forcing
increasingly expensive concessions from both state and capital.
As rioters, protesters, and strikers continued to force wages higher and
increase state programs, and as automation increased global productiv-
ity to be faster than consumption could absorb, corporations suddenly
couldn’t sell enough of their products and profits began to stall out. This
crisis came to a head in the crash and recession of the early 1970s—most
of that decade saw severe economic retrenchment, stagnation, and col-
lapse, as municipal and state governments went broke and jobs disap-
peared. But a total reckoning was staved off by the ending of the Bretton
Woods agreement and the “floating of the dollar,” which decoupled the
value of the dollar from real value in gold, fully transforming the US state
and the Federal Reserve into the backbone of global capital.
The crisis of profitability has never been resolved, but floating the
dollar gave space for a number of strategies to manage it. The violent
impact of the earliest of those strategies—globalization, consumer debt,
service economy development, financialization—was at first lessened
by domestic concessions won by the uprisings of the sixties and seven-
ties and papered over by consumer debt. But in the late seventies and
through the eighties, as working-class power faded, capital took the of-
fensive—most infamously in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and
Margaret Thatcher—and pushed forward strategies of austerity, union
destruction, repression, and privatization. These strategies all combined
to more or less guarantee profit and GDP growth in the medium term at
the expense of long-term social stability.
The inability of the government and the market to truly provide a
response to this crisis became obvious in the widespread destruction and


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 221
```
slow recovery initiated by the 2008 financial collapse. Finessing the un-
employment numbers has become the only jobs program the govern-
ment takes seriously, as stable, long-term jobs are replaced with low- and
minimum-wage, part-time, precarious, and seasonal work. People who
work three jobs but can barely pay the rent or who only get fifteen hours
a week at Target and live one illness away from total penury are gleefully
declared “employed!” by liberal metrics of economic health. The dis-
abled, imprisoned, undocumented, long-term unemployed, and other-
wise marginalized people are permanently cut out of the “official” labor
force statistics, further reducing unemployment numbers without chang-
ing material conditions.
The official poverty threshold is similarly kept absurdly low, not track-
ing changes in costs of education, health care, rent, or debt levels to hide
the fact that some 30 percent of Americans live in poverty while another
20 percent have a higher income but are only three months of unem-
ployment away from total poverty. Misery spreads everywhere while poli-
ticians, economists, and the media gaslight the population with reports of
recovery and economic strength. Wealth concentrates in an increasingly
small and increasingly rich capitalist class. At the time of this writing,
it seems the dam has finally broken on this strategy, as the shock of the
coronavirus shutdown has popped the fragile bubbles resting atop five
decades of debt and logistic schemes and created unimaginable unem-
ployment alongside mass death.
American triumphalism over the fall of the USSR, the victory of
global capitalism, and the “end of history”—the idea that political trans-
formation is over and that instead we will merely witness the global spread
and increase of liberal democracy and wealth—has been revealed for the
farce it always was. In truth, capitalism is gorging itself on the planet, de-
stroying the earth in a horrific ecological crisis that, rather than attempt
to solve, it merely schemes to profit off of even further. It is also killing
off the nation-state, the main form of political power it has relied on over
the last century and a half; governmental bodies such as the EU and
concepts such as “global cities” are testament to the fact that capitalism
requires openness to a total system of global flows more than it does the
development of profits through social spending and trade imbalances.


222 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Rather than a world of harmonious liberal democratic nations, capitalism
instead seems to be headed for a proliferation of high-tech, authoritarian
city-states that compete for resources against the backdrop of migration,
employment, pandemic, and starvation crises in widespread hinterlands
full of populations made surplus by automation and ecological collapse.^1
But this era of general crisis that began in the seventies did not see a
proliferation of mass movements in the United States. Instead, a wave of
revolutionary fervor faded and fell to repression. Although social move-
ments existed in the period—in particular, the gay-led AIDS movement,
the antinuclear movement, Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition, animal
rights, and alter-globalization—they often got bogged down in electoral
or nonprofit “single-issue”-style campaigns. And though instances of anti-
white-supremacist rioting and looting took place—most significantly in
LA in 1992, but antipolice riots popped up every few years throughout
the period—they mostly failed to initiate a cycle of social transformation.
Without a broader movement context, rioters increasingly appeared
as simple pariahs. Looting became the prototypical evidence of Black
pathology and crime. As the political center of gravity in America defin-
itively shifted to the white suburbs, even liberal explanations of rioting
and looting, such as those put forward by LBJ’s Kerner and Governor
Brown’s McCone Commissions, were rejected. Sociology was dismissed
for psychology, and narratives about looting and rioting were explained
as a question of culture, crime, and family. This newly re-racialized defi-
nition of looting would reach its horrific apotheosis in New Orleans in
2005, when police and white vigilantes murdered Hurricane Katrina ref-
ugees with impunity under the aegis of “stopping looting.”

Depending on where you look in the world, you will get a
different historical moment to date the end of the revolutionary wave
of the sixties: the police standoff with United Red Army militants in the
Asama-Sansoˉ incident in Japan in 1972, the coup unseating and killing
Chilean Marxist Salvador Allende in 1973, the end of the Cultural Rev-
olution and China siding with right-wing rebels in Angola in 1975–1976,


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 223
```
the murder of Red Army Faction (RAF) revolutionaries at the end of
the German Autumn of 1977, the precipitous decline of the autonomous
movement after Aldo Moro’s kidnapping in Italy in 1978, and so forth.
For the US movement, historical accounts converge consistently
around the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, as the antiwar movement pro-
vided the most consistent activist base for mass action across the United
States, particularly after the split and collapse of the Black Panther Party’s
national membership in 1970–1971. But perhaps the one moment that
most solidified the turn in national politics away from upheaval, social
justice, and equality and toward that reactionary suburban politics of
white grievance and white vengeance known as “color- blindness” and
“law and order” was the blackout looting in New York City in the sum-
mer of 1977.
A massive power failure on the brutally hot night of July 13, 1977, in-
stigated by lightning striking electric lines north of the city, plunged New
York City into darkness. People spilled out into the streets to help one
another, to party, and to loot, burn, and fight with police. Over sixteen
hundred businesses were looted in the twenty-five hours of blackout, and
forty-five hundred people were arrested—the largest mass arrest in New
York City history.
Looting mostly took place in poor Black and Latinx neighborhoods.
Arson and looting were so dire in Bushwick that business owners refused
to move back into the neighborhood for a decade after the blackout, but
more than thirty neighborhoods in the city were affected. The most bra-
zen acts of looting included teens driving fifty Pontiacs directly out of a
showroom in the Bronx. The widespread looting of otherwise unafford-
able turntables and mixing equipment is often cited as a crucial moment
in the birth and growth of hip-hop and DJ culture.
During the looting, Black businesses were targeted just the same as
white ones. Without the clear racial demarcation between businesses
that many pointed to in the sixties as evidence of looting’s “political”
nature, and without an initiating event of police brutality, defense of the
looting required directly challenging class society, not just racism. It re-
quired directly aligning with the “antisocial” actions of the proletariat in
making their own lives better at the expense of law and order. You’d have


224 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

to stand with them as they acted outside and against white supremacist
commodity society, even when they were not legibly “protesting” it.
But the riots not only lacked an obvious political content, they also
lacked a movement. The rise of the Black middle classes after civil rights
victories had, by 1977, reinforced and widened a significant class line
within Black communities. Income, wealth, and unemployment rates of
poor folks in the late seventies were often worse than they had been in
the sixties, but a small class had benefited. Black middle-class business
owners and politicians, who had replaced movement leaders as “repre-
sentative voices,” disavowed the looting: after all, it attacked their inter-
ests. The editorial board of Harlem’s Amsterdam News led the charge for
the Black middle class, writing an excoriating denunciation of the looting
that was reprinted in papers throughout the country to provide cover for
more openly racist antilooting positions.
Arrested looters, meanwhile, were processed with a deliberate slow-
ness that left thousands in horribly overcrowded cells for five or six days
in the middle of a record heat wave. Given rotten food and insufficient
water, they languished in collective punishment. “We slept on the floor
with our hands next to our body like the slaves brought over from Africa,”
one arrestee testified. It was a rather direct example of what Christina
Sharpe calls Black life “in the Hold.” As a way of reasserting property re-
lations after an act of looting, the state turns to its foundational strategies
and reintroduces the logistical techniques of the slave ship. Looters are
punished for their act by the traumatic (re)experiencing of the condi-
tions of the slave ship, an experience that shadows all racialization and
all property relations in America.^2
But police, judges, and the mayor played down this horrific violence,
instead participating in a broad dehumanization of the looters. They
used the fact that the municipal government of New York City was in
dire financial straits—nearly bankrupt, it had been devastated by white
flight and by the general economic downturn of the seventies—to falsely
claim they couldn’t afford to process looters in a timely fashion.
The poverty in the city was immense. Liberal economic and social
welfare policies had utterly failed to rectify the situation, as Great Society
programs, already too small to combat the problems of the late 1960s,


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 225
```
were completely insufficient in the face of the collapse and stagnation
started in 1973. White flight into the suburbs decimated the city’s tax
base at the same moment that the economy went into crisis. What the
programs had done, however, was give white people an excuse to blame
the Black and Latinx poor for their own condition. After all, hadn’t they
been receiving welfare, War on Poverty programs, affirmative action, and
all sorts of other special treatment from the government?
In his history Blackout, James Goodman traces how this shift was
made visible through the New York Times coverage of the blackout. The
editorial board at first attempted to explain and understand the looting
through the familiar liberal sociological lens of poverty, unemploy-
ment—which was at Great Depression levels in Black and Latinx com-
munities—and lack of services. But white subscribers, many of them now
living far outside the city, wrote in by the thousands, objecting, calling
the looters “animals” and “parasites.” Such “debates” happened in media
across the country, and it was the white suburban voice—which included
not only the newspapers’ and TV stations’ owners and editorial boards
but also the majority of paying customers—that won out. The looting,
white people insisted, was not about poverty—after all, weren’t they liv-
ing high on their welfare checks?—but about the degradation of morals
and a culture of lawlessness, laziness, and entitlement.
There would be no government inquiry, no sociological study: the
looters would not be asked why they had done it. The mayor, Democrat
Abraham Beame, lost the mayoral primaries that fall to conservative Ed
Koch in large part as a result of the blackout rioting. Koch fomented
outrage and blew dog whistles, criticizing Beame for not bringing in the
National Guard and not letting police attack looters more violently, rid-
ing “law and order” racism straight into Gracie Mansion.
The widespread dehumanization of looters and arsonists, of crimi-
nals, in the aftermath of the blackout helped consolidate the new white
supremacist politics of “color-blind” mass incarceration, precarity, pov-
erty, and police murder. Looting became an excellent symbol for this
new form of the old racial politics: it can be easily pointed to as a form
of the “shamelessness” of criminals. Taking place during mass unrest, it
can be treated as representative or reflective of a (Black) cultural or social


226 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

attitude as well as a general societal breakdown of law and order that
requires more authoritarian politics to “renew” the country. Meanwhile,
looting’s submerged history as a racialized relationship to property is
safely evoked without directly using “racist” language. “Looter” becomes
a perfect color-blind dog whistle.
This is why, on whitehouse.gov, Donald Trump’s administration
could write, on their special “Standing Up for Our Law Enforcement
Community” page: “Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the
rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter. Our job is to make life more
comfortable for parents who want their kids to be able to walk the streets
safely. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.”^3 The “rioter” and “looter”
is summoned as an innate enemy of the government and of the people,
of “us.” What about the Black parents who just wanted their kids, like
Michael Brown, “to be able to walk the streets safely”? Black mothers
and fathers are here purposely excluded from the body politic, and yet
the government hasn’t directly used any racialized language. Anti-rioting
is one of the major ways ethnonationalist power talks about its work of
racist oppression.
By the time a massive uprising broke out in Miami in May 1980, in
response to the acquittal of four police officers who had murdered Arthur
McDuffie after he ran a red light, these notions were firmly in place. The
uprising is little remembered now outside of Miami, but it was larger by
many metrics than Watts. More than four thousand police and National
Guard were deployed, and they were joined by white vigilantes. Together
they killed fourteen people, while four people were killed by rioters. A
hundred million dollars in property was looted and destroyed.
But the Miami uprising was not analyzed or discussed as the riots
of the sixties were in terms of inequality and racism. Instead, the Mi-
ami uprising was understood and analyzed through the subtly different
“color-blind” lens of “racial tensions,” which implies that white people
having racist feelings and Black people experiencing the effects of racism
are equivalent. Liberal commentators’ lines shifted, replacing unemploy-
ment and poverty with concepts like “hopelessness” and “despair.”
It’s not that affect and emotion are politically unimportant—quite
the opposite: anger, rage, and mourning are all crucial motivations of


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 227
```
people rising up. Rather, liberal explanations of riots as caused by “pov-
erty” are just as lacking and ahistorical as neoliberal evocations of “de-
spair.” But the turn to moral and psychological explanations for unrest
marks a transition to a frame that deemphasizes systems and structures in
favor of individual responsibility, family values, and “culture.”
The Miami uprising barely made the national news, and it was
quickly erased from the historical memory of the era. President Jimmy
Carter, facing a primary challenge from Ted Kennedy, was campaigning
on a promise of stability and competence. He ignored the Miami riots;
his administration hardly mentioned them. As historian Manning Mar-
able records: “The Miami rebellion was the first major racial uprising in
twelve years—yet it failed to make the front pages of white America’s two
prestige news weeklies, Time and Newsweek.”^4 The white people of the
country didn’t want to talk about Miami, and the memory of the massive
revolt was quickly buried under the rising tide of suburban conservatism
that would bring Ronald Reagan to office in a landslide election five
months later.

The largest US uprising in the twentieth century would not
be so easily ignored. Broadcast live on TV, while newscasters mouthed
platitudes and expressed shock and outrage over news helicopter–
captured images of crowds moving through South Central LA’s sprawl-
ing freeways and parking lots, the 120 hours of rioting and looting that
shook Los Angeles in 1992 seemed to inaugurate a new era of resistance.
Whereas Miami had largely been fought along Black versus white racial
lines, the LA riots quickly became ethnically diverse: “Of the first 5,000
arrests 52 per cent were poor Latinos, 10 per cent whites and only 38 per
cent blacks.”^5 The riots were an uprising of working-class Angelenos that
were initiated by a clear instance of anti-Black oppression and violence.
Resistance emerged along lines of a class solidarity with Black Angelenos
against the police, white supremacy, and capitalist domination.
Rioting was sparked when four police officers, whose beating nearly
to death of motorist Rodney King for speeding was captured on camera


228 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

and aired widely, were acquitted on April 29, 1992, at a trial moved from
LA to lily-white, hyper-conservative Simi Valley.^6 As that famous chant
that spread nationally from the LA uprising goes: “No Justice, No Peace!”
But the acquittal was only one instigating incident. The LAPD is consis-
tently rated as one of the most violent, racist, and fascistic police forces
in America, and police abuse, racism, and murder had escalated in the
years leading up to the riot. Another important incident had occurred six
months earlier, when a Korean store owner, who had murdered fifteen-
year-old Latasha Harlins for supposedly stealing a bottle of orange juice,
was convicted of manslaughter but received only a $500 fine and com-
munity service. The murder was caught on camera, and the $1.79 to pay
for the juice was found in Latasha’s hand.
These meant one angle of the riots was a racial battle between Black
people and the Korean immigrants who had come to own and manage
most of the businesses in South Central. Rioters systematically attacked
Korean businesses, and a television crew happened to be present for a
gunfight between Korean store owners and Black rioters. But much as
Watts was sometimes described as an anti-Semitic uprising, because
Jewish businesses were frequently targeted for destruction, actual “anti-
Korean” sentiment was contingent and largely beside the point. Instead,
just as Jews were in 1965, Koreans in 1992 were “on the front-line of the
confrontation between capital and the residents of central LA—they are
the face of capital for these communities.”^7
This racial pattern is a common strategy settler-colonial society uses
to deflect and misdirect tensions in the urban environment. Forming a
“buffer class” of ethnic entrepreneurs with easy access to small business
loans and support, these small shop owners perform the daily exploita-
tion of capital and as such perpetuate and absorb much of the violence
of the system in exchange for generational entry into the middle class
and whiteness. Black people are thus constantly kept at the bottom of the
racial hierarchy, while immigrant participation in American citizenship
is predicated on the expropriation of Black communities and the repro-
duction of anti-Blackness.
The media further attempted to frame the riots as race riots by focus-
ing on the beating of Reginald Denny. Denny, a white truck driver, had


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 229
```
the misfortune of driving through an intersection where the police and
National Guard had just been violently battling a group of Black teen-
age boys. Rioters pulled Denny from his truck and brutally assaulted and
robbed him. Footage of the beating was caught by a news helicopter—and
newscasters conveniently ignored the police violence preceding his attack
and almost never showed the subsequent rescue of and care for Denny
by other Black rioters, who quickly took him to a hospital, saving his life.
But while these media narratives failed to contain the anger of riot-
ers, neither do they sufficiently explain it. At the time the nature of the
uprising was such that even Newsweek reported that “what happened was
not a ‘race riot’ but a ‘class riot.’”* Black people were not the only ones
rioting. One of the most revolutionary aspects of the LA rebellion was
that the pattern that took a decade to unfold in the civil rights era—Black
people rising up and in turn encouraging the rest of the working class to
insurrection—happened instantaneously. “The rebellion started among
black people, spread immediately to involve Latinos in South Central
(which is about 42 percent Latino) and Pico Union, and then brought in
unemployed white workers from Hollywood in the north to Long Beach
in the south and Venice in the west.”^8 And the rebellion spread quickly to
other cities. Looting, rioting, fighting with the police, arson, and massive
infrastructural shutdowns popped off in San Francisco, the East Bay, San
Diego, San Jose, Tampa Bay, Las Vegas, Seattle, Rochester, and Atlanta,
and “there were smaller riots in Riverside, California, Denver, Miami,
and Peoria and Springfield, Illinois. Riots broke out in various locations
in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Alabama.”^9
Over a billion dollars in damages was done, and sixty-three people
died, the vast majority of whom perished at the hands of the fourteen
thousand police, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, National
Guard, federal marshals, border patrol agents, Army service members,
and Marines deployed on May 2 to put down the riots. More than eleven
thousand arrests were made, and a conservative estimate has 150,000 peo-
ple participating in the uprising.

*As is one of the core arguments of this book, such a clean distinction between class and
race is untenably problematic. But this does show that the strategy of explaining every-
thing solely through a nonclass, nonintersectional white–Black racial lens had failed.


230 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

The main aspect the rioting took was looting and arson: direct ex-
propriation of wealth and attacks on property. Unlike in Detroit in 1968,
there was little sniping at police (though rioters were definitely armed).
As journalist Mike Davis recorded at the time, “The gangs have refrained
from the deadly guerrilla warfare that they are so formidably equipped
to conduct.” As with every uprising, while (often gang-affiliated) youth
performed most of the combat, the looting crowd was diverse. “Men and
women, Black and white, young and old. People have brought their chil-
dren out here!” one gobsmacked TV journalist reported. A rioter inter-
viewed on live TV said, “Look around you! These people are not thugs
and gang members, these are women, children, babies, people that live
in this community who are tired of the constant oppression, the con-
stant abuse they have been served.” Reporters quickly turned to another
interview.
Whereas the uprising generalized across the working class, the riots
were led by a new group of the urban poor. Members of a new underclass
of the near permanently unemployed, cut adrift by the Reagan-driven
destruction of social services and the collapse of manufacturing jobs, ex-
isting largely outside of the circuits of production and consumption, this
class lives at the very margins of the market and of society. At the time
of the uprising, the LA court bureaucracy was referring to cases around
impoverished Black males as “NHI”—“No Humans Involved.” As Sylvia
Wynter writes, Rodney King was a member of these new Black masses,
who, in distinction to the Black middle class that had grown since the
sixties, “have come to occupy a doubled pariah status, no longer that
of only being Black, but of also belonging to the rapidly accelerating
Post-Industrial category of the poor and jobless.” People the state con-
sidered NHI led the LA uprising, and in thinking through and fighting
alongside their rebellion, Wynter argues, we can begin to overturn the
current system that constructs “humanity” in such a way as to exile them
from its protections and care.^10
Many Black radicals in the sixties foresaw this economic and social pro-
cess of double dehumanization: radical movement journals such as Soul-
book, The Movement, The Crusader, and Inner City Voice, to name only
a few, wrote consistently of the danger of coming automation and Black


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 231
```
isolation and alienation. Recognition of this class transformation is what
prompted the Black Panther Party to organize the people Marxists had
traditionally denigrated as the innately reactionary “Lumpenproletariat.”
The LA riots were the first uprising in the United States of this new
postindustrial underclass, which Marxist theorists have referred to as
“surplus populations”—people outside the process of the production of
value, people who aren’t even needed to drive down wages like the usual
mass of unemployed proletarians are. These people whom capitalism
regards as surplus do not and cannot make demands of a traditional in-
dustrial workplace, so their movements are invisible or opaque to many
so-called revolutionaries who believe revolution can only emerge from
a shop floor. And this disregard is furthered by the fact that the form of
organization favored by this new population of declassed poor is not the
union but the criminal gang.

In the weeks before the riot started, two warring sets within
the Crips and a major crew of the Bloods negotiated a truce. The truce
was finalized at a peace summit at the Imperial Courts Project gym in
Watts the day before the riots began, ending a gang war that had gone on
for two decades in which hundreds of people were killed. They called the
truce to build capacity to fight their real enemies, the police. This truce
was a significant factor in the growth of the uprising, as the gangs’ high
level of organization and pseudomilitary training would come in handy
in battling the police and opening up new areas of rebellion. As the fires
burned, most of the other gangs in LA declared peace as well.*
As Gerald Horne traces in his history of the Watts Uprising, Fire
This Time, three major organizational trends emerged in the wake of
Watts: the revolutionary activism of the Black Panther Party (and other

*Ryan Gattis’s All Involved, a widely renowned 2015 novel that frames the LA rebellion as
a moment of total lawlessness in which gang members settled scores and murdered peo-
ple indiscriminately—consistently implying that the only thing keeping gangsters from
going on killing sprees is the presence of the police—is a horrific inversion of these facts
and gets the meaning and effect of the riots on LA gang violence almost exactly wrong.


232 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Black radicals), “cultural” Black nationalism, and criminal gangs. As
COINTELPRO ruthlessly destroyed the revolutionary groups of the six-
ties and seventies, they left cultural nationalism like the Nation of Islam
and gangs as the only forms of organization in the ghetto.^11
To describe gangs as one dominant form of working-class organi-
zation is not to romanticize them. By bringing the international drug
trade through their communities, they manage to produce money and
employment for their “surplus populations” at the expense of dramatic
social damage in the form of addiction and violence. Deeply hierarchi-
cal, built on a sometimes almost cult-like devotion, and focused indelibly
on obtaining money, these are most certainly not revolutionary organiza-
tions—though you could also describe many trade unions the same way.
Another similarity the gangs have to the unions is that, as a form of
working-class organization with clear leaders and a cohesive disciplinary
apparatus, the state will, in moments of rebellion and upheaval, turn to
them to negotiate concessions in return for an end to riots. To this end,
the gangs in LA released a list of demands—most novel of which was the
proposal that a gang member with a video camera should be assigned to
every police patrol to keep them honest, but which also included more
traditional demands about jobs, social centers, amnesty for rioters, and
so forth.
The political role gangs play was even more pronounced in the 2015
Baltimore uprising: after street gangs and the Nation of Islam effectively
teamed up to stop looting and repress rioting, media broadcast the spec-
tacle of gang leaders sitting in on a city council meeting. They hadn’t
actually been welcomed into the official power structure of Baltimore,
and they haven’t achieved a lasting place in the council, but during an
uprising, any group that proves itself able to repress and dampen resis-
tance is temporarily given a seat at the table. Political parties, unions,
gangs, nonprofits, and any other organizational forms that imagine their
route to power goes through the state often stab uprisings in the back and
even ally with the police if it seems to serve them.
Despite propaganda to the contrary, gangs’ existence in the ghetto is
not only tolerated but also approved by the state, as they turn economic
and social violence largely inward while giving the state an unlimited


```

excuse for intervention and repression.* We see this in the widespread po-
lice practices of gang injunctions, gang databases, and mass arrest sweeps,
the most famous of which was the 2016 Bronx 120, when NYPD arrested
120 Black and Latinx youths in a series of massive raids; a huge number of
arrestees were unaffiliated. Gang injunctions name certain blocks, street
corners, or neighborhoods as “hotbeds” of gang activity, allowing police to
act with even more impunity in impoverished urban areas, banning pub-
lic gathering and prima facie criminalizing any young folks they want to
harass on the street. Gang databases, meanwhile, are little more than lists
of the poor urban youth who have had any interactions with law enforce-
ment, inventing gangs whole cloth to churn people more seamlessly into
the prison-industrial complex. But in uprisings against the police, gang-
bangers frequently become frontline soldiers, doing the most dramatic
and dangerous tasks in a riot. This danger—that peace between the gangs
could mean war on the pigs—became a reality during the LA rebellion.
And so, in the aftermath, the LAPD immediately focused on breaking
the gang truce. They attacked and broke up intergang unity rallies, shut
down “truce barbecues” going on all summer, and infiltrated deep into
the various gangs, working to instigate conflict. Nevertheless, the truce
held, and a grassroots-led movement of gang de-escalation spread across
the country, one of the main material victories of the riots. This led to an
immediate, dramatic drop off in gang violence in LA: homicides fell 44
percent in the first two years of the truce. Police, of course, took credit
for this drop, all the while working to undermine the peace. Though the
police couldn’t dismantle the truce directly, they did in the intervening
years manage to loosen and weaken gang organizational structure and
discipline.
The police work romanticized in HBO’s TV series The Wire—study-
ing the ins and outs of gang politics, personalities, and hierarchies in
order to arrest lieutenants and crush leaders—is a fantasy version of the

*This excuse, however, is just that—gang violence is as much a myth the police use as
an actual cause of their action, and, were it not for gangs, they would use something else.
As we have seen, police violence in Black neighborhoods is one of the few constants in
American history, and gangs and the drug war are merely the most recent iteration of the
ongoing explanation of that violence.

process of dis-organizing the gangs the police developed in LA after the ri-
ots and that spread to police departments across the country. Twenty-five
years later, most gangs in the United States now are small, decentralized,
highly localized groups of kids beefing over a few blocks, nothing like
the massive, tightly organized, pseudo-paramilitary forces formed in the
seventies and eighties.
Meanwhile, that form of gang organization and violence grew in
Latin America. These gangs were often direct products of US govern-
ment policy. The most famous example is in El Salvador, where hun-
dreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the US-backed, -militarized, and
-funded twelve-year civil war between left-wing guerillas and the govern-
ment crossed into the United States throughout the eighties. Living here
in poverty, and already once exiled by US policy, many boys joined gangs
as a way of staying safe in the streets of US cities, only to be sent back to
El Salvador under a Clinton-era scheme—initiated in 1995, only three
years after the end of the civil war—that deported any immigrants con-
victed of gang felonies.
So, boys, some of whom had no memory of El Salvador and many
of whom didn’t even speak Spanish, were sent back to a “home” coun-
try they had fled as children or even infants, places where they often
had no or only distant family. They then re-formed gangs based on those
they’d participated in in the States as a way of surviving their new, equally
hostile environment. These gangs have since become massive, terribly
violent, powerful actors. MS-13, one of the gangs transplanted directly
from LA, has, in yet another turn of this self-reinforcing cycle, become a
favorite racist bogeyman of the US anti-immigrant Right.
In other places, such as Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Af-
ghanistan, the enforcers of right-wing state structures put in place by or
emerging after US destabilization become drug warlords, cartels existing
as basically sovereign powers, pseudo-states funded by the more or less
infinite demand for drugs and immigrant laborers in the United States
and Europe. The war on terror is merely a continuation, into different
theaters, of tactics, strategies, and effects developed during the war on
drugs, which was itself an extension of the war on Black communities of
resistance.

The Inhumanity of Looters 235

The 2000s were a terrible decade of social dissolution and
oppression in the United States. The “stability and prosperity” of the
middle classes in the nineties were built on widespread increases in con-
sumer debt, not increased wages; “welfare reform” had doomed millions
to deeper poverty; NAFTA and other globalization trends continued
to smash unions and pull blue-collar jobs out of the country; and mass
incarceration had been expanded and accelerated to all-time highs by
tough-on-crime “new Democrats.”
Movements fared badly, too. The alter-globalization movement, a
bold, increasingly powerful, and militant association of anarchists, labor
radicals, and other activists that made world headlines by rioting to shut
down the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the 1999 Battle of Seattle,
was utterly shattered in the reactionary aftermath of the September 11
terrorist attacks. In their wake, George W. Bush’s administration swung
the state in an even more deeply authoritarian direction, consolidating
incredible powers in the White House, vastly expanding surveillance, im-
plementing more border and police apparatuses, and starting a forever
“War on Terror” in the Middle East.
Massive antipolice riots in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2001 and smaller anti-
Nazi rioting in Toledo, Ohio, in 2005 could not stem the rightward swing
and received little attention nationally. The biggest show of organized re-
sistance to Bush’s regime, the 2003 protests against the Iraq War—which
featured the largest single day of protest in world history—was simply
shrugged off and failed to transition into an ongoing antiwar movement.
And the immigrant rights movement, appearing on the scene with a mas-
sive strike and day of action, the Day Without an Immigrant on May
1, 2006, thereafter strayed increasingly toward patriotic, respectability-
focused, and Democratic Party–centered reform strategies.
The nadir of the entire period came in 2005, when Hurricane Ka-
trina hit the Gulf Coast. Katrina wreaked devastation across the South:
1,836 people died in the immediate flooding and chaos, and another
few thousand died in the next six months from conditions exacerbated
or caused by the storm’s destruction. And when the Mississippi River


236 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

overflowed its banks, destroying the levees and flooding 80 percent of
New Orleans, the anti-Black character of the Bush administration be-
came terribly clear.
As the majority Black city drowned, and the waters rose to fifteen feet
in many places, the federal government barely responded; a Canadian
Search and Rescue team managed to get a support force to New Orle-
ans faster than the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
did. When FEMA finally arrived, in many cases it actually slowed down
rescue and evacuation procedures with bureaucratic power struggles, ri-
diculous paperwork, and general incompetence.
Kanye West’s statement at a televised fundraiser that “George Bush
doesn’t care about Black people” was as clear a fact as could be. It was
an important generational moment, what Mychal Denzel Smith refers
to as a “rebirth of Black rage,” that was captured, shared, and dissemi-
nated widely by millennials using emerging internet technologies.^12 But
in those reactionary times, it was as far as the mainstream political con-
versation about anti-Blackness was going to go.
The municipal government of New Orleans, which had declared a
forced evacuation before the storm, was utterly unprepared for the disas-
ter—the police didn’t even have enough battery-powered radios to oper-
ate once the power went out—and local government totally collapsed.
Those too poor, old, or sick to leave New Orleans were left alone, without
food, route of escape, or safe haven in the midst of one of the largest natu-
ral disasters in US history. Of the nearly 1,836 people who lost their lives,
most of them were poor, Black, and elderly.
Seven thousand prisoners, the vast majority Black and almost all ar-
rested for minor crimes and misdemeanors, who were unlucky enough
to be jailed at the time of the storm, experienced, as prisoners always
do, some of the worst of government malevolence. They survived brutal
beatings and pepper spraying by police and jailers and the utter terror of
near drowning as they watched the waters rise from within locked cells.
Then many were seated outside in handcuffs in the hot sun for days wait-
ing for evacuation, only to spend the next year in prison, regardless of
charges, as the governor suspended habeas corpus. This was referred to
locally as “doing Katrina time.”


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 237
```
But rather than focus on the tragedy or the governmental crimes, me-
dia, both local and national, summoned instead the image of the Black
looter. They reported sniping at helicopters, widespread arson, the kill-
ing of rescue workers, mass rape and murder in the Superdome—“thug-
gery,” they called it. Almost all of these stories were false and had to be
retracted. Studies have consistently shown that in the wake of natural
disasters people come together and help each other, and crime and vio-
lence drop dramatically, and Katrina was no different. But the retractions
all came much too late. The enduring story of Katrina was of lawlessness,
criminality, riot.
White vigilantes and police officers, stewing in the paranoia and the
summer heat, responded with murder and mayhem, though the full ex-
tent of their crimes is unknown (much of the evidence appears to have
gone carefully unrecorded by police or was destroyed by the coroner and
other governmental offices). Oppressive actors, such as property own-
ers, the state, and white supremacists, use natural disasters to “restore”
law and order through brutal violence. It is hard not to see in their vio-
lence in the face of governmental collapse the shadow of the violence
of ex- Confederates in the chaotic early years of Reconstruction, and
in particular in the New Orleans riot in 1866, when police and other
ex-Confederate whites massacred forty-four Black delegates to the Loui-
siana Constitutional Convention.
Constructing a narrative of lawless Katrina survivors justified the hor-
rifying actions of police and white residents. Police murdered families
fleeing New Orleans, most infamously killing two and seriously wound-
ing four unarmed refugees on the Danziger Bridge and murdering
Danny Brumfield in front of the convention center—crimes for which
cops were actually prosecuted, although only a decade later. When two
Black men went to a police outpost looking for an ambulance to take
their friend Henry Glover, dying of a gunshot wound, to the hospital, po-
lice instead arrested and brutally beat the two men, left Glover to bleed
to death in the back of the car, then drove the car to a levee and lit it on
fire so as to not deal with his body.
These cases garnered a lot of media attention, and so prosecutors
focused all their energy and resources on them. But similar crimes went


238 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

pointedly uninvestigated. In white, middle-class Algiers Point, a militia
formed “to protect the neighborhood from looters and criminals” that in
fact hunted Black refugees. One vigilante, Wayne Janak, interviewed in
a documentary made after the storm, described killing Black survivors
as follows: “It was great! It was like pheasant season in South Dakota.
If it moved, you shot it.” Another, Nathan Roper, says police gave them
support and instruction to kill: “If they’re breaking in your property, do
what you gotta do and leave them [the bodies] on the side of the road.”
The emergence of “Stand Your Ground” laws, the first of which came
into being in October 2005 in Florida, another state badly damaged by
Katrina, codified into state laws these forms of white supremacist vigi-
lante murder.
Because these victims might have been “looting”—though they were
almost certainly just trying to get to the evacuation point in Algiers—their
deaths were disregarded, and the militiamen, who proudly described
their actions on video, went unpunished. Journalist A. C. Thompson in-
terviewed Tulane University historian Lance Hill (author of The Deacons
for Defense, cited extensively elsewhere in this book) about the situation:
“Because of the widespread notion that blacks engaged in looting and
thuggery as the disaster unfolded, Hill believes, many white New Orlea-
nians approved of the vigilante activity. ‘By and large, I think the white
mentality is that these people are exempt. . . . I think that if any of these
cases went to trial, and none of them have, I can’t see a white person
being convicted of any kind of crime against an African-American during
that period.’”^13
The New Orleans PD intentionally kept very few records during the
disaster, and the coroner also seems to have destroyed and covered up
information about bodies that came through his office.
Thus “looting,” real or imaginary, becomes an instant marker of the
“NHI” category described by Wynter. From the NYC blackout to LA
to Katrina, looting became the prototypical crime of the Black, poor,
and surplus, an act that immediately exiled its perpetrators from the hu-
man community and sentenced them to death, an action that proved
the righteousness of their disposability. It’s no wonder, after such violent


```
The Inhumanity of Looters 239
```
categorization, that people in movements today want to disavow looting
or distance “real protesters” from looters.
But we must not reproduce that mark of NHI on our comrades, our
siblings in the struggle. Instead, we must join them to overthrow the
world that would see anyone so marked.

H
istory is a funny thing. A CVS store in Baltimore, a Brook-
lyn Duane Reade, a St. Louis QuikTrip: these are not meant to be
historical places. In fact, an entire science, incorporating marketing,
psychology, architecture, and interior design, is devoted to giving cor-
porate spaces like these a sense of the timeless, infinite present of con-
sumption and stripping them of the possibility of change, of difference,
of politics, of history. But struggle can turn even the most consciously
constructed banality into a place of rupture, community, transformation,
and liberation.
That’s good, because in the last forty years capitalism has spread its
corporate banality across the whole of society, to say nothing of its terrible
violence and destruction. But we are once again in the midst of a global
period of struggle, which threatens to destroy and overturn those spaces,
to fill the world instead with life, love, beauty, and adventure, with soli-
darity, care, and peace. At the time of this writing, in April 2020, we are in
a worldwide quarantine lockdown against the coronavirus, looking down
the barrel at an economic collapse on par with that of the Great De-
pression. Worldwide struggles, and the fascist forces unleashed to destroy
them, seem certain to intensify.

When street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi lit himself on fire on De-
cember 17, 2010, in protest of humiliation and harassment at the hands of
municipal authorities, he initiated a wave of struggle that would spread
across Tunisia, through the whole of North Africa, and eventually out
to the entire world in what would be called the Arab Spring. The Arab
Spring’s most significant victories came in the fall of the Tunisian gov-
ernment of Ben Ali and dictator Hosni Mubarak in Egypt. Major move-
ments also sprang up in Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, and Syria, while massive
protests occurred in over a dozen other countries.
The fires spread to Europe that summer as huge social movements
shook Spain and Greece, and the largest riots the UK had seen in decades
unfolded after the police murder of Mark Duggan. From there, the wave
jumped the pond to the United States with the Occupy movement, then
bounced back to Africa with the #OccupyNigeria uprising. In Montreal
a militant student strike soon engulfed the entire city in protest, and the
villagers of Wukan, China, rose up, kicked out their local government,
and declared themselves a commune. Massive social movements seemed
poised to topple governments in Turkey and Brazil in 2013, and Bosnia
in 2014.
Political and social instability has meant opportunities for the Right
as well. The successful 2013 military coup in Egypt and Turkish president
Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s manipulation of a failed 2016 coup have seen
increasingly authoritarian powers put in place: protest has been outlawed
and repression comes at the barrel of a gun. The United States and UN
Security Council helped escalate the Arab Spring into a war in Libya
to take out Muammar Qaddafi, and the uprising in Syria was quickly
overtaken by a civil war in which most actors disdained and repressed
the social revolution. Brazil and Thailand saw right-wing movements ap-
propriate the language and tactics of the 2011–2013 “movement of the
squares,” while in Ukraine a squares-style political revolution was largely
co-opted by bourgeois liberals and right-wing Ukrainian nationalists.
Coups have been dismantling the legacy of the Pink Tide socialists in
Latin America. And Far Right parties and politicians have won electoral
victories in India, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, the UK, Hungary, the United
States, and the Philippines.

But still, liberation struggles spread. Many see the revolutionary ex-
periment in Kurdish Rojava as the Spanish Civil War of our time. In the
summer of 2014, Palestinians again rose up against the Zionist occupation
in Jerusalem, and solidarity marches and actions proliferated globally.
Movement has exploded in France: 2016 riots against a vicious reactionary
labor law were joined by the Nuit debout movement—a movement of the
squares that seemed to arrive three years past that tactic’s expiration date.
The year 2017 saw weeks-long antipolice #JusticepourTheo uprisings, and
in 2018–2019 the Gilet Jaunes (Yellow Vests) movement, featuring the most
destructive rioting in Paris since 1968, as struggle blazed across the entirety
of France, including the neocolonized African island nation of Reunion.
In 2016, a huge strike wave engulfed China, including a massive wild-
cat strike across Walmart factories throughout the country: strikes, despite
being outlawed, have been increasing in size and number year on year
in China, as have protests. The 2017 Gasolinazo movement in Mexico
followed in the footsteps of #OccupyNigeria, as, just as Nigerians had
exactly five years previously, widespread rioting and unrest flared against
cuts in gasoline subsidies, including significant looting and highway and
border shutdowns. Gasoline price rises also drove a huge rebellion in Su-
dan, which eventually saw the government of President Omar al-Bashir
toppled. The second half of 2018 included increasingly dramatic strug-
gles erupting across Haitian society, and these have continued into the
present. As this book was nearing completion, the world has seen another
wave of action akin to the struggles of 2011, as Chile, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon,
Algeria, Jordan, India, Indonesia, Colombia, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Ecua-
dor, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii have all had massive uprisings,
many verging on revolutionary upheaval.
And in the United States, alongside the struggles in Puerto Rico and
Hawaii, the historic #NoDAPL pipeline struggle, the largest prison strike
in American history, the generalization of militant antifascism, the anti-
ICE movement, and the movement that directly gave rise to this book,
the antipolice uprisings of the Movement for Black Lives, have all con-
tinued to agitate.
These American movements have been on the defensive under
the administration of Donald Trump. His first act in office was to push


244 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

through the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), and his police state agenda
has emboldened police officers and Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment (ICE) agents: the first days after his election huge gains in correc-
tions and military-industry stocks kept market indexes from suffering a
drop. The question of reforms, both of police departments and of the
prison system, seems moot. But, as Angela Davis puts it, “We cannot
simply call for reform. The entire history of police, the entire history of
prisons is a history of reform.”^1
A new energy of resistance is building across the country: the rate
and spread of struggle, at least as of this writing, seems to be intensifying,
as a wave of labor actions and rent strikes surges in response to the new
economic crisis. Combined with the impossibility of reform—symbol-
ized most recently in the Democratic Party’s defeat of the Bernie Sanders
campaign—it brings with it the growing sense that a more imaginative
solution is required. Abolition of the police and the prisons, as part of
the destruction of the state and the communist transformation of society,
seems to be the only path out of an otherwise fascistic future.
But as we enter a new period of heightened struggle, we must learn
the vital lessons of our history if we hope to truly shape our future. There
is quite simply no freedom without an end to white supremacy and settler
colonialism, without the victory of Black and Indigenous liberation. Cap-
italism, settler colonialism, and whiteness are so deeply intertwined that
any resistance against capitalism that fails to take on white supremacy is
doomed to repeating the failures of the past or, perhaps more horrifyingly,
to a reactionary victory that would innovate and reinvigorate capitalism
with new forms of settler domination under the guise of revolution.
Nevertheless, one revolutionary contradiction that always faces these
movements in the United States is that the majority of proletarians are
neither Black nor Indigenous, but are white, Latinx, or Asian. Those
people, oppressed by various forms of discrimination and left behind by
capital, are already primed to turn their rage against the system into rage
against Black, Indigenous, and revolutionary movements, and they are
vulnerable to capture by fascist, state, and other reactionary actors. We
saw this reactionary capture when Asian American activists took to the
streets to defend Chinese American cop Peter Liang, who was convicted


```

in 2016 for the 2014 murder of Akai Gurley in a housing project stairwell;
in the victory of Donald Trump among white exurban and Rust Belt
voting blocs; and in the spread of the militia and three-percenter move-
ments in the rural West. (The alt-right was much more homogenously
urban middle and upper class.)
This danger is greatest among white proletarians: as this book has
argued, an attack on the systems of property is an attack, ultimately, on
that axiomatic property whiteness, and this property-in-whiteness is the
only property many poor white people know. They see this piece of prop-
erty threatened by the abolition of whiteness and react with disgust at
the idea that they might be privileged by it—many are after all suffering
in deep generational poverty—at the same moment that they move to
defend it. The tendency among many leftists to disown rioting, property
destruction, and looting, in particular, and to attack “identity politics”
more generally as a way of appealing to liberals and the white working
class is ultimately a defense of whiteness, a way of building a rotten and
reactionary solidarity on behalf of the system.
A material appeal to these non-Black or non-Indigenous proletari-
ans cannot come in any form that downplays the seriousness, centrality,
and power of white supremacy and settler colonialism or that disavows
the leadership and righteousness of Black and Indigenous freedom fight-
ers. To ignore the situation of these proletarians completely, however,
threatens to leave in the rear a mass base for reactionary politics, raising
the specter of civil war. The struggle for the abolition of the police, pris-
ons, and borders offers one potential path through this contradiction, the
struggle against pipelines and ecological destruction in the name of In-
digenous sovereignty linking up with Appalachian pipeline defense offers
another, and the multiracial looting and rioting in solidarity with Black
Angelenos in LA in 1992, yet a third.
A revolutionary movement must reduce the value of whiteness to
zero while simultaneously demonstrating the possibility of better lives for
all of us stuck under its horrifying system—no small task, but not an im-
possible one, either. The very least revolutionaries can do is not disown
and disavow these moments of uprising but instead recognize in them
the wisdom and power of the Black revolutionary tradition, turn toward


246 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

these moments of rupture with joy, attention, and solidarity, and fight to
spread them to every corner of this globe. One tiny piece of that, which
this book hopes to contribute, may well be recognizing the revolutionary
history and potential of looting.
When the rebels of Ferguson stood up for Michael Brown, when they
fought back against continued police violence, domination, and control,
they gave birth to the most militant sustained struggle seen in the United
Stated since the seventies. They rose up both in the midst of a broad
international moment of struggle and crisis and out of the long Black
radical tradition in its specific American forms and its Black Atlantic
internationalism.

When Darren Wilson gunned down Mike Brown for the crime
of being Black in the middle of the street, Wilson’s actions represented no
great break with American history, no change in the nature of American
policing. When the Ferguson Police Department left Brown’s body lying
in the middle of the road for four hours, they practiced an anti-Black
white terrorism as old as the country. But when Brown’s friends, fam-
ily, and community rose up and fought back, when they rioted, looted,
marched, occupied, and organized in the streets of Ferguson, they pulled
us toward a definitive break with that history.
The riots in Ferguson gave birth to a new era of militant resistance in
America, the reemergence of the long movement for emancipation and
Black liberation. Where previous rioting, from Miami in 1980 to LA in
1992 to Cincinnati in 2001 to Oakland in 2009, had burned out in inten-
sity after a few nights, rioting in Ferguson was sustained for nearly two
weeks, with protests, marches, and street organizing continuing there-
after for months. Massive rioting recurred in November, when a grand
jury refused to indict Darren Wilson (despite the fact that, if a prosecutor
wants, a grand jury could “indict a ham sandwich,” as Sol Wachtler, chief
judge of the New York Appeals Court, once claimed).
The rioting in Ferguson became national news with the looting and
burning of a QuikTrip gas station on the first night after Mike Brown’s


```
Out of the Flames of Ferguson 247
```
death. But the riots went far beyond looting and arson. Shooting back at
the police—armed self-defense—and Molotov cocktail attacks on troop
carriers were tactics of the movement, though they were barely reported.^2
This lack of reporting has obvious explanations on both sides, as dis-
cussed in the previous sections on armed self-defense. For the organizers
focused on the outward appearance of the movement, already worried
about media framing of Black criminality and violence, the fact of shoot-
ing at police threatens to completely derail the argument of movement
nonviolence and innocence. For the police and the media, widespread,
organized retaliatory shooting absolutely cannot be reported on because
it represents an utter breakdown of respect for police power and threatens
to spread and generalize that disregard, to give rioters in other cities ideas.
Shooting at police is only reported (and, in these instances, exaggerated)
if and when police or national guardsmen kill rioters, because then it is
needed for justification. But it was through the consistent use of guns,
along with the creative use of cars to broaden chaos and jam up West Flo-
rissant, the main avenue of the uprising, that rioters managed to maintain
a mostly cop-free riot and protest zone for two weeks.
Knowledge of the armed aspect of the rioting should no longer be
kept a shameful secret but instead should be understood and celebrated
as action directly in line with self-defense movements of the Black tradi-
tion, from the Underground Railroad to the antilynching defense forces
to the armed participants in the southern Freedom Movement.
Rioters had more to contend with than only the uniformed police.
Nonviolent de-escalation, coming in the form of various peacekeepers,
politicians, and nonprofit organizers, emerged quickly as a policing prob-
lem from within the movement. Whereas Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson
were booed off stage and out of town, homegrown peacekeepers were
harder to deal with. Though some, particularly in the early days, blocked
looting or arson in the hopes of advancing the struggle ethically, others
did so on behalf of the police, the system of property, or their own politi-
cal power. In Ferguson, local politician Antonio French, the New Black
Panther Party (NBPP), and ministers were the most active peacekeepers.
Raven Rakia describes their actions: “Instead of focusing on the violence
of the police, peacekeepers are focused on silencing and quelling the


248 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

crowd—to the point where they pinpoint the issue being a person throw-
ing a plastic water bottle at a police line in riot gear, equipped with hel-
mets, body armor and armored trucks.”^3
Again, nonviolence emerges to put a brake on Black resistance, to
discipline and silence people rising up, while providing cover for the
intense violence of the state. We can no longer let the police, that despi-
cable occupying army, seem “natural,” nor let anyone paint resistance
to the settler state as an enemy of peace. Their peace is the peace of the
grave.
In Ferguson, such “peacekeepers” provoked immediate and direct
antagonisms. Many protesters saw clergy directly informing the police. In
at least one crucial instance, peacekeepers formed a wall in front of the
cops, preventing attempts by protesters to break police lines because they
were unwilling to charge into the clergymen.
Whereas socialist and pan-African Black nationalisms animated
some of the most important movements from the twenties through the
seventies, the most visible nationalist organizations have proven to be
reactionary forces in the current wave of struggle that use riots as oppor-
tunities to demonstrate their leadership and expand their control. NBPP
and Nation of Islam (NOI) leaders proudly bragged in press conferences
that it was they, and not the police, who were enforcing the curfew and
“controlling” protesters in Ferguson.
The most egregious example of their peacekeeping came in Balti-
more. During the 2015 uprising for Freddie Gray, the Nation of Islam
brokered a peace between gang leaders, not to fight police as in LA 1992,
but instead to stop the riots. TV crews caught scenes of NOI members,
obvious in their suits and bowties, chasing looters out of stores and then
protecting the stores from further looting. The NOI appealed to gang
members’ natural leadership as men in the community, and, “united
as Black men”—in many instances forming a human shield for the po-
lice—they quickly snuffed out instances of looting. Appeals to patriarchy
can always be used to protect private property, because without property
patriarchy is much weaker: the originary and only property guaranteed to
all men are, after all, the wife and children in his family. Here again we
see how often anti-militancy is patriarchal.

And then there are the co-opters of a more subtle variety, the “lead-
ers” and nonprofiteers who try to build careers off of media appearances,
who try to channel spontaneous uprisings into single-demand-based pro-
test models that can appeal to funds and funders, into electoral or re-
formist campaigns more easily controlled. And then there are the writers,
thinkers, activists, and revolutionaries—like me—who, in the name of
pushing the struggle forward, wrench it into theories, arguments, and
texts incapable of truly recapturing the fire and always, as such, threaten-
ing to extinguish it like a wet blanket.
As the flames rose above the Ferguson QuikTrip, those who would
put out the fires were, for the moment, outgunned by those who fought
for Michael Brown. In their moment of rage and mourning, they heard
that famous cry from Watts echoing down the decades: Burn, baby, burn.
After NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo’s acquittal for the murder of Eric
Garner, the flames leapt from Ferguson to New York and the Bay. Then
to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, Milwaukee, and Charlotte.
It seems likely that, with the even further emboldened and empow-
ered police under pig-in-chief Trump, and the global wave of mass re-
sistance and insurrection, a massive antipolice uprising is in the offing.
Maybe this summer, maybe next. Maybe when this book is published
it will already have happened.* When it does, we need to stand fast be-
side looters, rioters, and street fighters and struggle with them against
the liberal commentators, de-escalators, nonprofiteers, right-wing trolls,
vigilantes, and, of course, the police. We need to argue for and defend
every tactic that might help us to overturn this miserable world of white
supremacy, anti-Blackness, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, empire, and
property.
Justice for Mike Brown, for Freddie Gray, for Oscar Grant and Tan-
isha Anderson! Justice for Keith Lamont Scott, Sandra Bland, Sylville

*Author’s note: I handed this book’s final manuscript to the publisher on May 29, 2020.
On May 27, the Minneapolis riots for George Floyd began. As final touches were put on
the manuscript, late in the night as the 13th precinct burned to the ground, solidarity up-
risings had spread to Louisville, LA, Denver, Portland, Columbus, and Phoenix. I hope
by the time this book comes out to have already met some of you in the streets. As I write
this, I have no idea what political world this book will emerge into, and that’s beautiful.


250 IN DEFENSE OF LOOTING

Smith, Tamon Robinson, and Renisha McBride, for Kimani Gray,
Chyna Gibson, and Mercedes Successful! Justice for Trayvon Martin,
Sean Bell, Amadou Diallo, George Floyd, Troy Davis, Philando Castille,
Jamar Clark, Alton Sterling, Manuel Dias, and Joel Acevedo! Justice for
Tamir Rice, Korynn Gaines, Eric Garner, and Miriam Carey! Justice for
all those named and unnamed, those millions whose misfortune it has
been to be alive at the same time as America!
We will fight, and we will win, and build a world deserving of their
memory.

## Acknowledgments

For a variety of reasons, some due to my deep and cultivated laziness, most
due to frustrating factors outside my control, it took five years between begin-
ning this book and publishing it. In those five years I’ve lived in three differ-
ent cities in two different countries. To try to name all the people who have
inspired me, helped me, supported me, struggled beside me, and thought
and theorized with me in that period would be impossible: I could only end
up leaving someone out, and it would break my heart to do so. Instead, if you
think you might be one of the people described above, know that you are.
Thank you so much, this would’ve been impossible without you.
Next I want to acknowledge the rebels of Ferguson who taught me to
strengthen my critique and understanding of anti-Blackness, white suprem-
acy, capitalism, and the police, who inspired me to deepen my commitment
to abolition, revolution, and rebellion, who reignited the fire that’s been
burning as long as this settler colony has existed but have felt in recent de-
cades that it had been reduced to embers. The last six years have been cruel
to many of those activists and fighters, some of whom have been murdered
under mysterious circumstances. I hope this book honors their memory and
acts as a gift of gratitude to all who take the streets.


252252 Acknowledgments

I also want to thank the people who helped the original essay come to-
gether. To Hannah, Rob, Monalisa, and Ayesha, who worked on the original
piece in 2014 in different capacities, thank you so so much. This piece ended
up changing my life, and it wouldn’t have done so without all of your edits,
your time, your energy: while writing the book, I would frequently reflect on
the edits and interventions you made. And to the rest of the team at the New
Inquiry: thank you for the years of support, inspiration, and mutual creation.
You are some of the most talented writers, editors, and thinkers I’ve ever
known. It’s so great to know, all these years later, that a new generation of
editors is keeping the project alive.
Thank you to Rachel for suggesting I pitch the essay to an editor as a
book (and then, when I was too lazy and disorganized to do it, kicking my
ass into gear), and thank you to Katy for (eventually) being that editor. Your
deft editing and constant support over the last year have made the previous
four of frustration seem more than worth it, and you helped me believe that
there was something here when I was on the verge of giving up. Thanks to
the whole Bold Type team, Jocelynn, Miguel, and James. And special thanks
to Ian, who rescued the manuscript from stagnation and helped put it into
their capable hands.
I’d like to thank my family, chosen and bio-fam, who have been there
for me through this whole process. My parents and brother have been cheer-
leaders and supporters despite my decidedly antisocial topic of interest.
Thank you so much. Thanks, too, to Lala and Robespierre, who nestled in
laps, luxuriated in sun puddles, climbed all over the various keyboards on
which this was written, and generally demonstrated that the best life is one
without work, by example (and occasional demands for attention) gently
encouraging me toward that kind of life. And thanks, finally, to Sophie, my
best friend, my beautiful comrade in struggle, in thought, my sexy partner
in crime, my bestie for life. I love you so much. I can’t imagine what my life
would look like had you not come into it. I do know, however, that without
your love, your support, our stupid jokes, and your absolutely inspiring abil-
ity to hold me and all our friends accountable to our own best selves, I never
could have finished this book. Thank you.

sity of West Indies Press, 2006).
15. The history of these maroon communities has been carefully studied by
Russell Maroon Shoatz, who conducts his research from within the modern-day
plantation: Graterford State Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania. Shoatz, de-
spite spending twenty-two years in solitary confinement, has written extensively
and powerfully about the large maroon communities that existed in the American
South. Shoatz was imprisoned in 1972 as part of the “Philly Five,” accused and
convicted of shooting a police officer in an attack on a Philadelphia police station
in 1970. Shoatz, whose book is accurately titled Maroon the Implacable, has spent
a life in resistance, not only carrying out his scholarship but also escaping twice
and organizing with the Pennsylvania Association of Lifers, a group dedicated to
ending life-without-parole sentences. As a political prisoner and an absolute enemy
of the white supremacist carceral state, he has been kept in solitary confinement for
most of his adult life. Along with prison abolition and the history of revolutionary
practice, he has recently added his voice to ecological struggles and questions of
food security. To support him, buy his book, learn more about his life, and read his
incredible scholarship, go to https://russellmaroonshoats.wordpress.com/.
