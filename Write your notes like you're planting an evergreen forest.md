###### [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

You don't need to know how to cut down a forest when you start spreading seeds. All you need to start an evergreen Forest is seeds ([[write what you think]]) and a place to plant them ([[you can write your notes anywhere]]). 

While you're forced won't be able to flourish without a good system that does not mean you need to fully understand the system when you start planting the forest. In fact becoming overwhelmed by the system is the number one reason that Forest failed to grow. While having an unattended forest can be very overwhelming it can also provide the knowledge and context you need in order to choose the correct system.

That being said, if you don't know what an evergreen forest looks like you don't know which kind of seeds to plant.
