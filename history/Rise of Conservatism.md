# Notes

## **Document A**:  [Ronald Reagan's 'A Time to Choose' speech](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1964reagan1.asp)

- This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.
- Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, "What greater service we could render if only we had a little more money and a little more power." But the truth is that outside of its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector.

## **Document B**:  [Ronald Reagan's Inaugural Address, 1981](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/reagan1.asp)

- You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?
- They will go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
- In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.
- From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.
- In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet, not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
- I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.

## **Document C**:  [Ronald Reagan's 'Evil Empire' Speech, 1983](https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/reagan-evil-empire-speech-text/)

- [[religious freedom]]
  - Its discovery was the great triumph of our Founding Fathers, voiced by William Penn when he said: “If we will not be governed by God, we must be governed by tyrants.” Explaining the inalienable rights of men, Jefferson said, “The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.” And it was George Washington who said that “of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.”
  - No matter how well intentioned, [those who believe in secularism]value system is radically different from that of most Americans.
  - When our founding fathers passed the First Amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference. They never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself.
  - The First Amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech.
- I repeat: America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal
- abortion
  - An organization of citizens, sincerely motivated, deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent, some time ago established a nationwide network of clinics to offer help to these girls and, hopefully, alleviate this situation.
  - A judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule. I’ve watched TV panel shows discuss this issue, seen columnists pontificating on our error, but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex.
  - Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity, then its right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must be protected.
- fear mongering
  - I know that you’ve been horrified, as have I, by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice.
  - I pointed out that, as good [[Marxist-Leninists]], the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution.
  - Morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war. And everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat.
  - And we will never stop searching for a genuine peace, but we can assure none of these things America stands for through the so-called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some.
    - Sets up USSR's moral inferiority and then uses it to justify continuing the cold war
- So, I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority. You know, I’ve always believed that old Screwtape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the Church. So, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, I urge you to beware the temptation of pride–the temptation of blithely..uh..declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil.

## **Document D**: [Reagan's Impact and Legacy](https://millercenter.org/president/reagan/impact-and-legacy)

- As the [[Soviet Union]] disappeared into the mists of history, Reagan's partisans asserted that he had "won" the Cold War.
- the number of democratic nations as well as the reach of free-market ideology expanded on Reagan's watch. But, as Russia's recent autocratic path suggests, the permanence of these advances remains in doubt
- Some historians cite the U.S. military buildup under Reagan and the pressures exerted by his pet program, the Strategic Defense Initiative. Others emphasize the increased restiveness of Eastern European nations, particularly Poland, and Soviet overreach in Afghanistan. Still others point to the implosion of the Soviet economy after 75 years of Communist rule.
- On the one hand, tax reduction and a tightening of interest rates by the Federal Reserve led to a record period of peacetime economic growth. On the other, this growth was accompanied by record growth in the national debt, the federal budget deficit, and the trade deficit.
- the supply-side tax cuts did not produce the increase in revenues that Reagan had predicted.
- Reagan also succeeded in a principal goal of reducing the marginal income tax rate, which was 70 percent when he took office and 28 percent when he left.
- This paved the way for Bill Clinton's centrist capture of the Democratic nomination and the presidency in 1992
- Even today, with Democrats back in control, there are more avowed Reagan Republicans in Congress than there ever were during Reagan's lifetime. In the 2008 contest for the Republican presidential nomination, virtually all the candidates proclaimed that they would follow in Reagan's footsteps.
- In the tradition of American populists, Reagan ran for office as an outsider who was determined to restore traditional values.

## **Document E**:  [Excerpts from the Republican Platform, 2016](https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/courses/35892/files/4873566?wrap=1)

- The federal fiscal burden threatens the security, liberty, and independence of our nation...  The Republican path to fiscal sanity and economic expansion begins with a constitutional requirement for a federal balanced budget....
- Our country faces a national security crisis, and only be electing a Republican to the White House will we restore law and order to our land and safety to our citizens.
- We affirm the Constitution’s fundamental principles: limited government, separation of powers, individual liberty, and the rule of law....
- All workers, including union members, must be free to accept raises and rewards without veto power from union officials.
- We oppose tax policies that deliberately divide Americans or promote class warfare.
- Republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative.
- The President and the Democratic party have dismantled Americans' system of healthcare.

# Post

## Part A: How did President Reagan define American conservatism? What were its basic beliefs and goals? What choices did Americans need to make? Were all of the goals consistent with the established beliefs? Why or why not?

Reagan set the standard for [[American Conservatism]] that stands to this day. His three major beliefs were religious conservatism, anti-liberalism, and financial conservatism (Lecture). The most impactful of these beliefs is financial conservatism, which has also been called Reaganomics and supply-side economics. This is the belief that reducing tax rates across the board will allow for more spending and investment and thus more job creation. While this is true for tax cuts on the lower class, who will spend any additional money in the economy, it is not true for the tax cuts of the higher class which will hoard their wealth beyond reason. This is what we see today. Much of this belief is based on the incorrect assumption that [[Reagan]] said so plainly in his 1964 speech, "But the truth is that outside of its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector." (Doc A, para 6) These kinds of beliefs push the idea that the only good government is a small government, which Reagan espoused in his 1981 inaugural address, "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." (Doc B, para 9) Reagan's anti-government stance lead to a crash in 1982 do to over-spending and over-cutting (Lecture). This crash could have been worse but it was saved by regulations put in place after the great depression. (Lecture) Reagan then went back on his word and increased government spending that helped to bring the economy back. The book gives credit to three things for this economic recovery: government spending, lower interest rates, and tax cuts. (Textbook, pg 1106) In opposition to these small-government beliefs, Reagan pushed for large government in many other ways. Reagan aligned the American government with religious and moral superiority and his enemy (the USSR) with secularism and moral inferiority. He used this logic to justify his opposition of the nuclear freeze which aimed to help end the Cold War. (Doc C) Some historians point to this and his increase in military spending as reasons for the USSR's collapse, while others cite Eastern European nations and internal issues as factors. (Doc D) He also used this moral superiority to justify government interference in woman's right to choose. (Doc C) These beliefs were consistent enough to get Americans to vote for him, but for most that was all they were good for. Reagan's campaigns were full of unfulfilled promises, but his rhetoric and charm were enough to keep his approval rating high for his entire two terms.

## Part B: Compare Reagan's goals and language with the Republican Party's platform from 2016. What similarities can you identify? What changed between Reagan's presidency and the election of 2016? How did Reagan set the stage for the current political right? Do any inconsistencies remain in the established beliefs and goals?

I think that the Republican party has stuck very well to Reagan's beliefs while losing the rhetoric, bi-partisanship, and population that made him so successful. One way they have superseded him is in becoming a true opposition party. They still align various political causes with moral imperatives including, "the establishment of a pro-growth tax code," (Doc E, pg 2) and claim that the only way to bring, "safety to [America's] citizens," (Doc E, pg 4) is through a Republican president. Republicans also continue in his trend of campaigning on things that they put no effort towards doing, including abolishing abortion, opposing tax policies that, "divide Americans or promote class warfare," (Doc E, pg 2) and of course balancing the budget. No Republican since and including Reagan has balanced the budget or even reduced the deficit, but they have impeded progress on most everything in the name of it. The only significant change that I see is in the ethnic makeup of America. As we get closer and closer to being majority-minority, Republicans can no longer rely on the middle-class white American to win as Reagan and [[Clinton]] did. (Textbook, 1124)
