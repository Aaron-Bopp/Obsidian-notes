### [Breaking the Cycle of Overthinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUxU6KnjNNs)

- [[Def]] Agoraphobia - fear of going outside
    - developed from the fear of having a panic attack in an unkown environment
    - So afraid of losing control outside of their home but they never leave
    - Agoraphobia lite - leaving the home but constantly analyzing
- "If I ignore it, it will go away. If I talk about it, it becomes real" [[patient]] talking about [[anxiety]]
    - Ignoring it is his way of controlling it
        - ignore is really not letting it into your mind
        - zoning out is ignoring
- [[Ref/DrK]] "If your mind is doing something there's a damn good reason for it"
- Anxious [[parents]] breed anxious children. [[anxiety]]
    - There was a study that gave [[anxiety]] meds to [[parents]] and the kids got the same benefit as meds
