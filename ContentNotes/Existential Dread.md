### [Existential Dread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUC8qF5iDag)
- [[Neuroscience]]
	- When under stress people are unable to focus on things other than the stressors
		- Adrenaline hits in seconds and lasts for minutes
		- Cortisol hits within the hour and last for 4-24 hours
			- Basically keeps you on guard so that you're easier to wake from sleep, more aware, etc.
		- These we formed for physical forms of stress (tigers) but now effect us even for mental stressors 
	- Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions
		- Our brains are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty/find reasons for illogical decisions
			- If given too many options the brain will make choices that we cannot immediately understand the reasons for
		- If we get paralyzed through lack of knowledge we won't act 
			- Existential Dread comes from the knowledge that we are ignorant/can't fully understand the world
		- #Def [Neurosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis) -> the tendency to worry
	- As a human, a lot of what is good for us makes us suffer
		- Most professional success comes from Conscientiousness and Neuroticism  
		- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  5-Factor Model
		- #Def [Neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism) -> sometimes defined as a tendency for quick arousal when stimulated and slow relaxation from arousal, especially with regard to negative emotional arousal.
			- Is a trait in many models within personality theory, but there is significant disagreement on its definition
		- #Def [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) -> the personality trait of being careful, or diligent. 
			- Conscientiousness implies a desire to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. 
			- Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly.
- Difference between anxious thoughts vs a feeling of existential dread
	- Your feelings can manifest as thoughts
	- Feeling alone in the world can come from people fundamentally not understanding you at an early age
- The way the mind works 
	- Mamos -> emotional mind
		- happens within 0-1s and then stores the emotional state
		- Examples
			- emotional
			- likes/dislikes
			- reacts
			- guttural
			- sense
	- Buddhi -> analytical mind
		- Processing emotions
		- using stored coping mechanisms to deal with stored emotional states
		- examples
			- "just try it"
			- "experience new things"
- #Ref/DrK Competence comes from empathic mirroring
	- #TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE Confidence problems come from when parents can't mirror the child's emotional needs
		- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  [[Attachment Theory]]
