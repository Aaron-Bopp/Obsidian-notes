[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] but you don't have a secure identity because => [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] so you have no way of treating this anxiety which leads to [[social discomfort]] => [[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] #TO/DO/REFACTOR these notes which weaken your identity because [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] => which leads to a lack of secure identity, and the [[feedback loop]] repeats.

The only way of this is loop is [[self-actualization]]
