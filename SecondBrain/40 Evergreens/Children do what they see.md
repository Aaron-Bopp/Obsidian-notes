#### [[Children do what they see]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This fact of imitation and modeling is key in [[Behavioral Pyschology]] and [[Social Learning Theory]], as well as [[Evolutionary Pyschology]]. This leads to so many elements of modern society such as [[gender roles]], [[racism]], and [[inter-generational trauma]].

This fact is true in both synchronous interactions like fear responses and [[self soothing]], but also in asynchronous responses like [[gender schema]]'s. This means that children may see and action and then not reproduce for months or years later.
