#### [[Note stubbing vs you don't need to make your vault into wikipedia]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many a [[knowledge management|PKM]] guru has warned against "collecting thought vs creating thought" or ["don't make your vault a second wikipedia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms) and I whole heartedly agree... for beginners. 

There is a difference between idly grabbing every article you read the headline of and creating a process for absorbing articles into you [[second brain]] that involves including the most important text in your vault so you can search for it. There is a difference from bombarding yourself with notes that are summary or copy pasted from wikipedia and using note stubs as a form of connection [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]].
