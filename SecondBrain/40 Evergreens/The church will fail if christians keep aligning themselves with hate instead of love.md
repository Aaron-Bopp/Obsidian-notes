#### [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I honestly think that the only way that the church can continue to exist is through throwing out the sanctity of the bible and cherry-picking it.  Church membership is down 40% in the past 30 years and its only gonna keep going down #TO/DO/REFERENCE 

This is majorly due to [[the politicization of the christian church]]
