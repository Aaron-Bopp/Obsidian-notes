#### [[How Neuroscience impacts our daily lives]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions]]. [^1]  If our brains were unable to create reasoning and thought processes for completely illogical conclusions we wouldn't be where we are today ([[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]). This ability to pattern match is a major part of why we have survived as a species (and how me evolve see [[neurodiversity]]). If a prehistoric human was attacked by a tiger and survived the rest of their life needed to be focused on avoiding tigers. They needed to be able to remember everything that lead up to the encounter, exactly how it happened, and exactly how to get out of it. However, in modern times, these natural instincts are not always needed to survive, and can even cause more emotional anguish than they prevent. This is the basis for [[PTSD]] and [[anxiety]]. 

[[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]] When the human body is put under stress it will produce various chemicals in order to heighten its chance of survival. These include [[Adrenaline]] and [[Cortisol]]. Adrenaline will hit in seconds and last for minutes after it allows for fast action and hyper awareness of the situation. Cortisol will last for 4-24 hours depending on the duration of the encounter and it keeps you aware and ready to act at a moments notice. [^2] These are the chemicals that allow us to survive incredibly dangerous situations without extraordinary strength or resilience, but they can also be activated at times when they are not really needed.
