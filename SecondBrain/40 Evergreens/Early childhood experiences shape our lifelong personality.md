#### [[Early childhood experiences shape our lifelong personality]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Especially in [[early childhood development]], negative experiences can change the way that we act. Because [[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]] and [[Behavioral Pyschology]], these experiences can become integral parts of our [[personality|personalities]] or form into [[mental disorders]].

[[Social anxiety]] disorders can lead to introverted, highly socially aware individuals, and addressing that [[anxiety]] can sometimes be seen as the destruction of an essential part of that person. These assumptions can also result in [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] so while some of these feelings are valid, on the whole removing these anxieties will only allow you to flourish.
