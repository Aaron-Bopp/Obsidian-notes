#### [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

While [[Early childhood experiences shape our lifelong personality]]/[[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]], working through your negative emotions will not change you fundamentally because negative effects are more influential than positive. Those negative effects suppressed parts of you and positive parts are the ones that made it through.  

Because of this working through [[trauma]] will not fundamentally change you.[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]], but we cannot look at world where so many people are affected by [[trauma]] and think that once everybody is healed we will all be the same. In fact working through [[trauma]] will only allow people to more accurately express and become their true selves.
