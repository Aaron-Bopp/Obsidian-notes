#### [[Gender Dysphoria can take many forms]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/REORIENT this and [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]

[[Gender Dysphoria]] does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong [[gender]] with all the wrong body parts. [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]. People will experience [[gender]] differently and any inconsistency with other [[transgender|trans]] people does not invalidate their existence. 

[[videoTransComingOutStory|Abigail Thorn]] relates the experience of being [[transgender]] to being assigned a crappy job at birth and then being told by everyone around you that you could never switch jobs. Not everthing about the job is bad, and you even find joy in it, but it ways on you until you break, or give up, and while transitioning doesn't make everything instantly better it makes life so much more easy and bearable that you can finally start to enjoy it.
