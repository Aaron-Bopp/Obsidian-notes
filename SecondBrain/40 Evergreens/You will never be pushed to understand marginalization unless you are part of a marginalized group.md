#### [[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

For some it will be very difficult to fit their [[self|identity]] into the world around, so they will be forced to struggle through and find purpose and meaning in that journey, but others will fit in easily and never fully understand themselves. These people are disadvantaged because they are taught to be ignorant of struggle.
