## Part A: How did President Reagan define American conservatism? What were its basic beliefs and goals? What choices did Americans need to make? Were all of the goals consistent with the established beliefs? Why or why not?

[[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]   [[Anti-government stances lead to economic crashes]] Some historians point to this and his increase in military spending as reasons for the [[Russia|USSR]]'s collapse, while others cite Eastern European nations and internal issues as factors. ([[Reagans Impact and Legacy]]) He also used this moral superiority to justify [[government]] interference in woman's right to choose. ([[Ronald Reagan Evil Empire Speech]]) These beliefs were consistent enough to get [[America|Americans]] to vote for him, but for most that was all they were good for. [[Reagan]]'s campaigns were full of unfulfilled promises, but his rhetoric and charm were enough to keep his approval rating high for his entire two terms.

## Part B: Compare Reagan's goals and language with the Republican Party's platform from 2016. What similarities can you identify? What changed between Reagan's presidency and the election of 2016? How did Reagan set the stage for the current political right? Do any inconsistencies remain in the established beliefs and goals?

I think that the [[Republican]] party has stuck very well to [[Reagan]]'s beliefs while losing the rhetoric, bi-partisanship, and population that made him so successful. One way they have superseded him is in becoming a true opposition party. They still align various political causes with moral imperatives including, "the establishment of a pro-growth tax code," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 2) and claim that the only way to bring, "safety to [America's] citizens," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 4) is through a [[Republican]] president. Republicans also continue in his trend of campaigning on things that they put no effort towards doing, including abolishing [[abortion]], opposing tax policies that, "divide [[America|Americans]] or promote class warfare," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 2) and of course balancing the budget. No [[Republican]] since and including [[Reagan]] has balanced the budget or even reduced the deficit, but they have impeded progress on most everything in the name of it. The only significant change that I see is in the ethnic makeup of [[America]]. As we get closer and closer to being majority-minority, Republicans can no longer rely on the middle-class white American to win as [[Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]] did.
