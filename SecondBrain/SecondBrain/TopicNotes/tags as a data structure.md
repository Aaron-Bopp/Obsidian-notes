##### [[tags as a data structure]] `=length(this.file.inlinks) + length(this.file.outlinks)`
There are several reasons that you might want to parse through your entire [[personal knowledge management]] system for specific data. Whether it be finding everything you've qouted, everything you've defined, or everything you've referenced, this can be useful for finding something or just for fun. Tags can provide the impotice for formatting such repeated data in a consistent way that can easily be parsed, and they also provide a quick shortcut to find this data manually.

Examples

>  #Qoute/Inspiration All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. 
>  -- Gandalf

#Def Term => a word or phrase used to describe a thing or to express a concept
