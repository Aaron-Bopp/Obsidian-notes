###### [[permanent note]]

A permanent note is a singular concept that you have conceptualized and written down. This term is used across [[personal knowledge management]] and [[Zettlekassen]] systems but its use within specific systems varies. In general, a permanent note is something that you do not want to forget, but it can be combined with other notes, expanded upon, and changed over time. Permanent notes are are a broader category that would include [[evergreen notes]], and a [[zettle]].
