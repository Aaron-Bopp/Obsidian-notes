 [[Self-perception]] is the way that you view yourself externally and it may be instep or out of step with the way your view yourself internally, or your [[self-image]]. This [[perception]] may be based in reality but it is often influenced by societal pressures, [[inter-personal communication]], [[gender dysphoria]], or [[body dysmorphia]]
