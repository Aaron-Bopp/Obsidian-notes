**Definition**:: [[Self-perception]] is the way that you view yourself externally, and it may be instep or out of step with the way you view yourself internally, or your [[self-image]]. This [[perception]] may be based in reality, but it is often influenced by societal pressures, [[inter-personal communication]], [[gender]] schema, or [[body dysmorphia]]
