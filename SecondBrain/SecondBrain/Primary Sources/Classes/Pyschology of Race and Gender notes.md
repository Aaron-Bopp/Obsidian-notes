## Multiculturalism and Colorblindness
- Multiculturalism => multiple cultures living together and supporting each other without assimilating or sacrificing their culture.
	- what if people don't want to be a part of a culture that they are recognized for?
	- cons
		- can lead to tokenism and stereotyping 
		- 
- Color blindness => seeing everybody as equal, not labeling people according to the color of their skins
	- seen as separate from using color blindness to make racist remarks
	- != ignoring race's existence, applies more in individual situations
		- even if you can be colorblind you that will blind you to other peoples racism
