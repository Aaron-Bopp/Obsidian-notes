## Multiculturalism and Colorblindness
- Multiculturalism => multiple cultures living together and supporting each other without assimilating or sacrificing their culture.
	- what if people don't want to be a part of a culture that they are recognized for?
	- cons
		- can lead to tokenism and stereotyping 
		- 
- Color blindness => seeing everybody as equal, not labeling people according to the color of their skins
	- seen as separate from using color blindness to make racist remarks
	- != ignoring race's existence, applies more in individual situations
		- even if you can be colorblind you that will blind you to other peoples racism

# Week 3
## Readings
- [[Historical Foundations of Race]]
- [[Winton (2020) - Scientific Racism and North American Psychology.pdf]]
## Race
- Race is a social classification based solely off of the color of your skin
- Races have been created for classifying and otherizing various groups of people over the years 
- Difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality
	- race is physical experience
	- ethnic background
	- place where a person holds citizenship
- Race is socially constructed
	- there is nothing in our genes that determines what black people or white people look like only arbitrary physical characteristics
	- if race is more than biology
		- racial differences arent due to biology
		- societal hierarchies around race are not based on "real" differences
		- the concepts of race and racial groups are malleable not fixed
	- intially used to reinforce racial inequality
		- science was only incorporated to justify inequality
	- early racial conceptions still persist today through steriotypes, raical categories, scientifiic research
- Race still exist despite being socially constructed
- There is nothing racist about categorizing people by race, it is when you treat people differently based off that group that it becomes racist.
### Scientific Racism
- The use of science to justify racist beliefs and racial stratification
- There has been a lack of objectivity in race based science
- Physiognomy: judging psychological factors based on external appearance, especially the face
	- now known as a pseudo-science 
- r/K theory: species can be ordered on a continuum based on number and quality of offspring
	- lower species have more/worse offspring, "higher" species have fewer/better
- cephalic index: some races have smaller brains == lower IQ scores
- IQ scores increasing over time
	- black scores are increasing faster than other groups
- racial admixture
	- black kids with high iqs do not reliably have more european dna than those with lower IQs
- it all comes down to socio-economic status
