##### [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]] `=length(this.file.inlinks) + length(this.file.outlinks)`

These large insecurities developed because [[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]], and [[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]]. Because of these factors we can value that protection because we have so much stored up ([[Samskara]]) fear for those situations. 

With a small fear, we are often annoyed at it but for a large one, while we may wish it wasn't there we know what the lack of it will mean
