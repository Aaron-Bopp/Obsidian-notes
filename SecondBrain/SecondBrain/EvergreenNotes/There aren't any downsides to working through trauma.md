#### [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
Working through your negative emotions will not change you fundamentally because negative effects are more influential than positive. Those negative effects suppressed parts of you and positive parts are the ones that made it through. 

Especially in [[early childhood development]], negative experiences can change the way that we act. If a young child receives a negative reaction they do not understand, they will make and assumption in order to avoid receiving that negative reaction again. This is a fundamental fact of human psychology ([[How Neuroscience impacts our daily lives]]), but it's affects can be quite powerful. Because [[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]] and because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]], these experiences can become integral parts of our personalities. [[social anxiety]] disorders can lead to introverted, highly socially aware individuals, and addressing that [[anxiety]] can sometimes be seen as the destruction of an essential part of that person. These assumptions can also result in [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. [[Anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] so while some of these feelings are valid, on the whole removing these anxieties will only allow you to flourish. 

Because of the fact that working through [[trauma]] will not fundamentally change a person, we cannot look at world where so many people are affected by [[trauma]] and think that once everybody is healed we will all be the same. [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]] but that does not mean you are letting go of yourself. In fact working through [[trauma]] will only allow people to more accurately express and become their true selves.
