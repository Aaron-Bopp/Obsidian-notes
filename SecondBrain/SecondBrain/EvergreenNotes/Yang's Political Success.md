#### [[Yang's Political Success]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Yang's success in the 2020 primary was and always will be of note. As a relative outsider, he was able to gain a large amount of [[grassroot support]] from both sides of the aisle. He did this by identifying problems of the world in an data driven way that did not overtly offend either party. He cast himself as a successful but empathetic [[business]] man who would be able to navigate the political landscape while being still being an outsider. He did this by basing his campaign on policy and technological change. While Yang did not significantly impact the 2020 race he did bring [[UBI]] to the forefront of American's mind and gave himself name recognition that put him at the head of NYC Mayoral race one year later.
