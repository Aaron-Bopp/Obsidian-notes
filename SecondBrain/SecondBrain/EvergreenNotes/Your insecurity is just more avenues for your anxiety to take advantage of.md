#### [[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When entering into social situations you might feel [[anxiety]] because you don't if you are going to have any friends there, or what exactly the plans are, or how you will interact with the people there. The cause of this [[anxiety]] is the [[fear of consequences]] and specifically the fear of invalidation. 

 [[Our brains are built around survival]] and what will increase our fitness ([[Neuroscience]]) and one of those is [[socialization|social fitness]]. If you are able to interact and win favor among other humans you are more likely to pass on your genes which thus increases your [[socialization|social fitness]]. The way that this primal urge manifests in our complex understanding of emotion is in [[self-worth]] and by contradiction [[insecurity]] of [[self]]. ([[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]]) 

 If you are insecure in your [[self]], you may feel levels of [[social discomfort]] during [[socialization]]. Part of this is because any slight to you, any level of ineptitude, or feeling of disapproval has nothing to be respelled by. [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]], but [[self]] is not always the thing being attacked.

 If you have achieved a high level of [[socialization| social fitness]] you will often be surrounded by people reinforcing your [[self-worth]], but that does not mean you are secure in your [[self]].  Often those who value outside validation the most are the most susceptible to attacks on [[self]], and often they are blind to their own insecurities because their [[socialization]] is valued so highly.
