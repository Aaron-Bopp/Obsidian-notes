#### [[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome, so insecurity of any kind ([[food insecurity]], [[self-doubt]], etc) is going to increase it. 

For social situations, this is why [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

[[Anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
