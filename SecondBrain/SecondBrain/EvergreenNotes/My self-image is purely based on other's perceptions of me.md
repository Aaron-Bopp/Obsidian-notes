#### [[My self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is a bit part of [[My relationship with my parents]]. From an early age, [[A mismatch between your self-image and the way others percieve you destroys self-image]] caused me to not trust my own experience of the world because as a [[transgender|trans]] person, my [[self-image]] or [[my gender]] was wholly different than the [[gender]] that was expected of me.

This really impacted my [[social anxiety]] because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
