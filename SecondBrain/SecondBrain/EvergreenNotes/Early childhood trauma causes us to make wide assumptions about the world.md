#### [[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[early childhood]] [[trauma]] causes use to make massive, sweeping assumptions about our lives, because our understanding of the world is so limited. Any formative experience will impact a large portion of our understanding of the world because we do not understand the context of that experience. 

Early [[childhood trauma]] can be the cause of many of many [[mental disorders]] such as [[anxiety]], [[depression]], [[dissociation]] disorders, and others.
