#### [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Solutions oriented people are too often focused on making the problem go away rather than actually engaging with the material conditions of the situation and finding a solution that is sensible and effective. [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]. 

When communicating with people you don't know (such as through the internet) [[empathy]] is the first and most important thing you should convey. If you do not show a willingness to understand somebodies opinion they will not give you the time of day. Looking for understanding first will also lead to better outcomes when trying to convince someone of your solution
