#### [[Explaining emotion can just be a way of escaping the situation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Being able to explain the emotions you are publicly feeling will relieve the attention that you are receiving. If this is what you want then this is a success but it does not mean that you've effectively dealt with the emotions. 

[[My self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me]]. This means that if other people perceive me as understanding my issues and having dealt with them I think that I have dealt with them, even though I haven't. This has formed a lot of really powerful, and really-limiting [[defense-mechanisms]] in the form of [[self-improvement]]. 

[[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]]. Me having combined avoidance with perceived understanding means that it is doubly as dangerous.
