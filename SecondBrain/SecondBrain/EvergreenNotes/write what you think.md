#### [[write what you think]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Starting to write notes can be intimidating for many reasons, one of which being that you don't know what to write about. The beauty of a [[second brain]] is that it is meant to be an extension of your thought. This means you can write about anything that you are thinking about. Additionally, notes in a [[second brain]] are concept-oriented and atomic, meaning that they do not need to expansive or all encapturing. [[evergreen notes]] can be as small as a few sentences or as expansive as an entire breakdown of an idea. They can also be written about anything, as long as you are interested in writing them.
