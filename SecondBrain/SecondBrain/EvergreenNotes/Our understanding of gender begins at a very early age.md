#### [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Children can tell the difference between male and female faces between bith and three months and develop a [[gender identity]] around 18 months to two years and [[gender constancy]] develops around 3-4. [^1] 

While young children can descern gender at an early age that does not mean gender is not a social construct and in reality children are just as willing to accept [[gender non-comformity]] if it is taught instead of the [[gender binary]]. 

This studied understanding of gender in children only reinforces the validity of [[trans]] children
