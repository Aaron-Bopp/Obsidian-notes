#### [[The many transgressions of the christian church]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> I can't believe that the Bible is infallible because I cannot understand how a loving being could commit genocide so freely and unashamedly. I cannot reconcile a god who would intentionally create a being with the knowledge that they would sin (and create the tree to let them do it) and still condemn them to hell as if it were only on them.
