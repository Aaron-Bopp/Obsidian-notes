###### [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]

Accepting responsibility often requires accepting responsibility for things out of your control. Whether it be your own [[trauma]], the needs of others pushed upon you, or the sins of your ancestors that you still benefit from. Accepting responsibility for these kind of things is not taught at a young age in [[America]] because that goes against [[individualism]].

Accepting responsibility for things outside of your control does not have anything to do with the actions. Actions cannot be reversed, nor can that often be rectified. Accepting responsibility means acknowledging why the event happened, what it did to you, and what it did to other people. These are important parts of moving forward for yourself and for the people affected by the event.
