#### [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This structure is how I [[Make your inbox into an entry point]] and is deeply entwined with [[how I use Obsidian tags]] as a part of [[My Second Brain]]

- TO tags should be used for specific items, not general tasks	
- TO tags are note a daily [[TODO]], they are a way to specify a task inline the to be done in the future. These tags should be temporary, but they are not scheduled 
- #TO  see all the things you want to do in you [[Obsidian (software)]]
	- #TO/DO things that you have to actively take part in,
		- #TO/DO/WRITE write a specific item, not used for need to write or expand an evergreen note
		- #TO/DO/PROGRAM 
		- #TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE 
		- #TO/DO/REFERENCE
		- #TO/DO/REFACTOR 
	- #TO/EXPLORE 
		- #TO/EXPLORE/READ 
		- #TO/EXPLORE/WATCH
		- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH 
	- #TO/PONDER ideas or concepts that require deep thought.
		- #TO/PONDER/ME 
		- #TO/PONDER/SOCIETY

- This structure is both a reference for what kind of note it is, but also an entry point to work on [[evergreen notes]]s
- #EVER see all the [[evergreen notes]] in the [[Obsidian (software)]]
	- #EVER/SEED a concept
		- #EVER/SEED/UNPLANTED a concept that has no links into the [[web of thought]]
		- #EVER/SEED/WATER a concept that I would like to add more to
	- #EVER/SPROUT a concept that has information and value, but I have no current intention of expanding
		- #EVER/SPROUT/WATER concept needs more time and energy put in
		- #EVER/SPROUT/CULTIVATE concept needs to be cleaned up and interconnected with the rest of the [[second brain]]
	- #EVER/GREEN concept that holds weight, value, and knowledge in the [[second brain]] and needs no immediate work
		- #EVER/GREEN/GROWING This is a note that has the solid base of a concept and is interlinked with the [[second brain]], but many of those links need water, or are unplanted. This note is not ever/green because the notes linked within in it are actively changing, and that may require to work on the ever/green
		- #EVER/GREEN/PRUNE [[evergreen notes]] that needs to be looked at and rethought through in the context of the [[second brain]]. May include adding and removing connections, separating out distinct concepts into their own notes and removing inaccurate information
