#### [[Hope is not optimisim it is a practice for producing change]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you can find hope within yourself or within other people its all worth it

> "Kaba states, “I always tell people, for me, hope doesn’t preclude feeling sadness or frustration or anger or any other emotion that makes total sense. Hope isn’t an emotion, you know? **Hope is not optimism**” (p. 26). Kaba views hope as something you practice, a philosophy that is essential in the sustained fight for prison abolition."
