#### [[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gender]] sets expectations for how we exist in the world, and it influences how we shape our habits to fit our society. We shape our mannerisms behaviors, communication and expectations to [[conscious|consciously]] and [[subconscious|subconsciously]] to fit our [[gender]]. [[1 What is Gender]]

This is the best rebuff to, "but they're making it their whole [[personality]]" Of course they are! That's called self-love! but keep in mind [[The difference between identity and presentation]]
