#### [[I thought negative emotions were natural and that positive emotions weren't real]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I think from an early age I had many sources of negative feedback for things that made me feel like who I was supposed to be was unnatural ([[My self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me]]). Whether it was getting my hair cut short, or feeling a rush of testosterone when playing sports or being competitive, things that I was supposed to like weren't reinforced by my assigned [[gender]] ([[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]], [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]). Things that did make me feel good were discouraged. [[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]]

The only logical thought process I could have at that age ([[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]]) was that the positive emotions that received negative condemnation were unnatural and so I made a sweeping generalization that all positive emotions were unnatural. This is why I poured my interests into things that were intellectual pursuits. [[My unfulfilled need for parental validation became a fear of rejection and disregarment of affection]]

While I do think this sweeping generalization was there. Obviously as a child didn't understand it. Sometimes I would pursue things because I thought they really did make me happy, while other times they actually did make me happy but in a way that I didn't think was wrong. I still did things that makes me happy, I'm not going to lose those as I understand myself more ([[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]). As I have questioned my existence more and more I have discovered more and more internalized beliefs of mine that are irrational and unnatural. These discoveries give me hope, but the solution scares me. [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence]]

This expanded on here: [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]
