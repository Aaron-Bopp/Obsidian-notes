#### [[Stereotyping has the pyschological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When meet a new person or interact with a new situation, we fill in assumed information as a part of the process of learning about them. This is a normal process, but overreliance on it can lead to negative stereotyping and making the person feel judged. Stereotyping another groups behavior as worse than our own personal behavior or the behavior of someone we admire is a form of self-enhancement. This behavior leads to harmless distinctions and harmful beliefs ([[racism]], [[homophobia]], etc)

[[Stereotypes are beliefs, prejudices are feelings, and discrimination is treatment towards a group a member of group]]
