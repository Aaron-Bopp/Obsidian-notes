#### [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[trauma]] becomes part of our very nature through the fact that [[Early childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]]. Large parts of our personality and our [[inter-personal communication|inter-personal relationships]] are affected by trauma and so working through it can impact the way we interact the world. Yet it remains true that [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]. You are more that your trauma, working through it may involve letting go of things that you thought were important but were really holding you back. This can also mean [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions|Accepting responsibility for moving past your trauma]].
