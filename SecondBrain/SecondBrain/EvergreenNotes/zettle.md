#### [[zettle]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

A zettle is a single idea or thought as defined by the creator of the [[Zettlekassen]] Method. It is closely related to [[evergreen notes]]s and [[permanent note]]s and shares quite a few similarities with them.

[[Andy Matuschak]] defines the key similarities between zettle's and [[evergreen notes]]s as: [^1]
 - concept-oriented
 - atomicity
 - emphasis on linkage
 - serendipity
 - develop over time
