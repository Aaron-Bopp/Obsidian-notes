#### [[your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you are feeling [[anxiety]] it can often be very difficult to understand where the [[anxiety]] is coming from. In some situations it can be obvious (skydiving, flying, having a child, buying a house) while at other times it may seem obvious but be very nuanced, and at others it can be almost impossible to discover the source of the [[anxiety]], because [[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]].

As you are trying to deal with your [[anxiety]] you may start removing many perceived sources of [[anxiety]] to no success. This may be because there are just too many sources of [[anxiety]], or because the source of [[anxiety]] is much more primal and less obvious. 

For example, people who are mentally handicapped often have very deep [[anxiety]] because they do not have the ability to understand situations and thus aren't able to find the source of the situation and [[anxiety]]. #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Mental handicaps affect on [[anxiety]]. 

You can also experience large amounts of [[anxiety]] if your identity is severely repressed. ([[Identity is your understanding of yourself and your interaction with the world]]) If you do not have an accurate identity, then you will be feeling things without understanding them. This will generate a large amount of [[anxiety]] because you do not understand the sources of the feelings well enough to predict when and understand why they happen. This can happen with a lot with people who have not discovered they are [[transgender]] or even with people who are not allowed to interact with the world how they want to.
