In [[Obsidian (software)]] tags are little more than a stored [[SEARCH]], but they can provide some needed structure and a good amount of use. I primarily use tags as an inbox,[[Make your inbox into an entry point]] a classifier, ([[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]), and finally as a data structure ([[tags as a data structure]])
