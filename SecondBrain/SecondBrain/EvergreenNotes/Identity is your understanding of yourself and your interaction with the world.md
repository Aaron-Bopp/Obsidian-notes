#### [[Identity is your understanding of yourself and your interaction with the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

At the core of [[self]] is how you view yourself vs how the world views you. If you have no view of yourself then how the worlds views you will completely win, resulting in little to no sense of [[self]]. 

Many people will think they have a strong [[self]], but in actuality this [[self]] is just there concerted efforts to conform to society's views. Other's may feel a very strong sense of [[self]] because their in sense of [[self]] is aligned with society's view of them.

Those who think they have a weak [[self]] have either realized that they do not have a sense of [[self]] outside of how other's treat them, or that they do not reveal their inner sense of [[self]] to other people. [[My self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me]], because of my invalidating childhood and [[A mismatch between your self-image and the way others percieve you destroys self-image]] 

If I identify as a homo sapien, I see myself a something that once evolved from a an ape. If I identify as a man, I see myself as somebody who fits the box of whatever I see a man as. If I identify as awkward, I see my interactions with other people and deem them as unnatural and awkward, or perhaps I recognize that certain patterns of behavior that I take part in have often gotten strange reactions from people so I deem my normal actions as awkward. 

However, [[self]] is more than just an objective viewing of our actions. [[self]] is also impacted by the physical reactions that our bodies go through. If we feel a certain way during an interaction that will impact our [[self]], either through a [[conscious]] viewing and reflection on that feeling, or a [[subconscious]] reaction to either avoid or pursue that feeling again. 

If your understanding of the world is impaired that means that your [[self]] will be hard to understand.
