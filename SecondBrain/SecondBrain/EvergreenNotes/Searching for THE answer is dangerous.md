If you only ever [[search]] for answers to problem's you lose sight of the actual point of [[education]], to better understand the world. If your [[search]] for THE answer to answer your question once and for all, you wall yourself off to better understanding that may come from finding out why that answer is wrong or needs to be built on. Additionally, if you spend a long time looking for this answer you will [[subconscious|subconsciously]] be unwilling to accept criticism of that point. Look for answers don't look for solutions.
