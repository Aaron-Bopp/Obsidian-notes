###### [[How to represent a todo list]]

The only required piece of a todo list is that it is temporary. The items on your todo list will get done eventually, but how quickly you expect them to get done is up to you. If you like your todo list to be a running list of quick task those things may get done quickly. If you prefer your todo list of items that you would like to do at some point you may be looking at those items for quite a while before they get finished.

The way you represent a todo note will vary system to system and person to person. The most important thing is that you are able to find the things you need todo quickly and easily. This can mean having a permanent note where you are your todos whenever you think of them, or a feature like a tag or unique symbol that will allow you to find them easily in other notes. You can also create more narrow representations of todo's if the way you will interact is significantly different. Once you have completed a todo, it should be removed from your todo list.

My todo list is represented by [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]. This works because I am not going to my todo list as a daily task, so I am okay with items sitting in there for a long time. The ever/green structure is also meant to be permanent because [[evergreen notes]]s are always changing and growing. For to/do tags, once I finish a task I remove the tag which clears up the [[Obsidian (software)]] tag search for other tasks.
