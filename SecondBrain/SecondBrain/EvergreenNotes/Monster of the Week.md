###### [[Monster of the Week]]

In Monster of the Week, the world of monsters is just below the surface of societies collective consciousness. Much like our real world you've heard ghost stories, and watched shows about bigfoot hunting, maybe you even saw a shape in the shadows that you were just never able to explain. Maybe you never thought they were real, or you had an odd fascination with finding out, or maybe you got a little closer than most people that would have wanted, but there's nothing special about you, except that you're one of the ones who know's monsters are real. ^9b6191

Monster of the Week is a [[TTRPG]] that aims to create condensed and succinct adventures that can be finished in one play session. It does this by centering the gameplay around one creature, *the monster of the week.* The rules of MOTW are also catered towards a specific adventure style. The hunters first learn of the monster, learn about the monster, and then (hopefully) defeat the monster. The characters abilities are catered either around gathering information, gaining resources to fight the monster, or actually fighting the monster. Once the players have defeated the monster, the session is complete.
