#### [[The difference between identity and presentation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Presentation is what we show to the world, it is our hair, style, the way we walk the way we talk. For many it is a performance, for some it is a burden, and for most it is simply the way of life. 

[[self|identity]] is so much more than this, [[Identity is a sense of self not a pattern of traits or behavior]], it is who we are behind our ego, behind our fears, it is everything we could want to be, we must simply unlock it.
