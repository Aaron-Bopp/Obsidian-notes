#####  [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] `=length(this.file.inlinks) + length(this.file.outlinks)`

Human's own conception of their [[self]] is dependent on many things including their [[early childhood]], [[socialization]], and their [[perception]] of the world. [[pessimism]] and [[realism]] are beliefs that equate a negative outlook on the world with intelligence. If a person internalizes the narrative that negative emotions are a sign of intelligence, when they eventually feel sad they will feel as if it is the correct emotion to feel. This is often true. Sadness is often the correct emotion to feel in a situation, but when sadness is not the correct emotion to feel, this person will still believe that they are correct. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]. 

Once a person has set up this belief that negative emotion is associated with intelligence, you can struggle to find [[happiness]] in bleak situations, and find it easy to find sadness in okay situations. Often as your intelligence and knowledge of the world increases, you will find that the only proper reaction is increasing sadness. [[Knowledge of the world is painful]]

This way of living your life is [[subconscious|subconsciously]] attractive, because you will think your increasing sadness is a sign of your increasing [[enlightenment]], while it is exactly the opposite.  You cannot get stuck in this enlightened sadness because it will lead to inaction and because [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence]].

[[The nature of happiness is not doing what you love its detachment from the decisions of the life]]. [[You can be enlightened and still grieve]], but [[enlightenment comes from detachment]]. #TO/DO/REFACTOR these notes

Once someone has reached this state of "[[enlightenment]]," they will not only find it incredibly hard to be happy, they will see any [[happiness]] they do find as illogical, unnatural, and generally unwarranted. So obviously, [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]
