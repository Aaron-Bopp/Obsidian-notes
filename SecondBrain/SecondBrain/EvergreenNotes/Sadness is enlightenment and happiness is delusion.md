Human's own conception of their self is dependent on many things including their [[early childhood]], [[socialization]], and their [[perception of the world]]. [[pessimism]] and [[realism]] are beliefs that equate a negative outlook on the world with intelligence. If a person internalizes the narrative that negative emotions are a sign of intelligence, when they eventually feel sad they will feel as if it is the correct emotion to feel. This is often true. Sadness is often the correct emotion to feel in a situation, but when sadness is not the correct emotion to feel, this person will still believe that they are correct. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]. 

Once a person has set up this belief that negative emotion  is associated with intelligence, you can struggle to find happiness in bleak situations, and find it easy to find sadness in okay situations. Often as your intelligence and knowledge of the world increases, you will find that the only proper reaction is increasing sadness. [[Knowledge of the world is painful]]. 

This way of living your life is subconsciously attractive, because you will think your increasing sadness is a sign of your increasing [[enlightenment]], while it is exactly the opposite. [[You can be enlightened and still grieve]], but [[enlightenment comes from detachment]]. [[Bhuddism is the study of happiness through detachment]]

For me this meant, [[I thought negative emotions were natural and that positive emotions weren't real]]

Once someone has reached this state of "enlightenment," they will not only find it incredibly hard to be happy, they will see any happiness they do find as illogical, unnatural, and generally unwarranted. So obviously, [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]
