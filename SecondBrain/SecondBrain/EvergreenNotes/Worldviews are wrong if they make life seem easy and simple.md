#### [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The pursuit of [[self-actualization]] is different for every person. #TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE ==For some it will be very difficult to fit their [[self|identity]] into the world around, so they will be force to struggle through and find purpose and meaning in that journey, but others will fit in easily and never fully understand themselves. ==These people are disadvantaged because they are taught to be ignorant of struggle. 

This is seen in [[individualism|individualistic]] cultures like [[America]], and in worldviews that are focused on salvation and not [[self-improvement]] ([[Christianity]]). [[The actual work of being a good person isn't explored by Christianity]]
