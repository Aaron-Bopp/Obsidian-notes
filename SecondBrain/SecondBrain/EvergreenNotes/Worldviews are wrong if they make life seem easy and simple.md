#### [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The pursuit of [[self-actualization]] is different for every person. For some it will be hard to fit their [[self|identity]] into the world around so they will struggle through and find purpose and meaning in that journey, but others will fit in easily and never be forced to fully understand themselves. These people are the disadvantaged ones because they are never taught to be ignorant of struggle. 

This is seen in [[individualism|individualistic]] cultures like [[America]], and in worldview that are focused on salvation and not [[self-improvement]] ([[Christianity]]). [[The actual work of being a good person isn't explored by Christianity]]
