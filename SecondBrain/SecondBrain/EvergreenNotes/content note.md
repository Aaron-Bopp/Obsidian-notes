#### [[content note]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

A content note is made up of notes taken while consuming some form of content such as a book, article, video, or podcast. A content note does not contain thoughts or ideas based on the content, just an organization of interesting moments and thoughts within the content.

A content note should also contain important information that is relevant to citing and referencing the resource again. Content notes are like rain for your [[evergreen notes]] forest. ([[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]) Consuming content is an important part about being able to grow and find ideas to write about. 

Template: [[CONTENT]]
