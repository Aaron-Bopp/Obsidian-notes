#### [[To be happy you need to not be sad]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Major sources of sadness such as [[socio-economic]] conditions, [[trauma]] ([[societal trauma]], [[childhood trauma]]) or other major sources of [[depression]], [[gender dysphoria]], [[dissociation]], or other [[mental disorders]] will stop the ability to be happy just by the shear weight of their sadness. Some forms of [[neurodivergency]] ([[ADHD]], [[Autism]]) can also cause chemical imbalances that prevent full or consistent [[happiness]].
