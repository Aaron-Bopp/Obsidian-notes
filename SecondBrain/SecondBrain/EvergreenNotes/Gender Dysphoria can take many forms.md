#### [[Gender Dysphoria can take many forms]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gender Dysphoria]] does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong [[gender]] with all the wrong body parts. [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]. People will experience [[gender]] differently and any inconsistency with other [[transgender|trans]] people does not invalidate their existence.
