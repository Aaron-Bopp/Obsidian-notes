#### [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the core belief's or [[Christianity]] is that we have [[free-will]]. This is important for a couple reasons, we must have the [[free-will]] to choose God's [[love]], and we must have the [[free-will]] to choose to sin. This is the basis of the genesis story and our "sin nature." This belief is also the main reason [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]. Hell is allowed to be such a horrible place because you choose to be in it by refusing god's grace.

Because [[free-will]] is so integral to loving god and avoiding punishment, it becomes a core part of the [[Christianity | christian]] [[worldview]], and when they see a non-believer they [[subconscious | subconsiously]] know that person has made the choice to go to hell. This plays a large part in the drive for evangelism and mission work, but it also changes [[Christianity|Christian]]'s relationships with others.
