#### [[How the patriarchy effects you men's understanding of masculinity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

According to <u>The Bullied Boy,</u> an article by Paul Horton, masculinism is what leads many young boys to bullying. [[Masculinism]] is the belief that a male is supposed to be dominant, and this trait is common in school boys. He says," For boys, then, the question is not whether to take on a typical male sex role, but rather how to position themselves according to the masculine discourses available to them" (Horton, 2018).
