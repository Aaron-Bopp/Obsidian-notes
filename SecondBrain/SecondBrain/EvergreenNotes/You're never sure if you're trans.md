#### [[You're never sure if you're trans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You're never sure you're [[transgender|trans]]. I heard that in a [[tiktok]] today. I don't think you admit that you're [[transgender|trans]]. It's not a decision. You don't even really discover it. You just one day realize that you're a girl, and it makes total sense. That part is so obvious that it doesn't feel real. It feels like a dream that you can't achieve, and the process of achieving it is the difficult part
