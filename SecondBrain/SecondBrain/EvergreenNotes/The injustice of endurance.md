#### [[The injustice of endurance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In a world where there are enough resources to provide for everyone, it is unjust to be forced to endure scarcity just so that some people can be rich. 

You should never be forced to endure. [[Endurance]] is a choice you make to push through, not something that can be forced upon you.
