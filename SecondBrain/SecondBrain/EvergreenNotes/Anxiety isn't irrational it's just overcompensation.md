#### [[Anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

People who say [[anxiety]] is irrational are just unaware of their surroundings. Or they will answer to their fears but not understand where they come from, [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]

For the most part [[anxiety]] is completely natural and normal [[Neuroscience|neurological]] reaction but it can extended into the realm of overcompensation by [[trauma]] (i.e. [[Rejection Sensitivity]]), [[neurodivergency]], or simply a warped sense of reality.
