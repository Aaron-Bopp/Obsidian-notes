#### [[Constantly working on yourself is a form a self-hatred]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You can't hate every mistake you make. You have to accept that you made them and sometimes that's okay. 

If you can never be content that you are good enough, you are just looking for another part of your [[self]] to hate. This is fundamentally different from just loving yourself
