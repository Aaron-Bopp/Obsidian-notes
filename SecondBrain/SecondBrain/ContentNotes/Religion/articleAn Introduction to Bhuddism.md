**Buddhism: An Introduction**

Buddhism is a major global [[religion]] with a complex history and system of beliefs. The following is intended only to introduce Buddhism's history and fundamental tenets, and by no means covers the [[religion]] exhaustively. To learn more about Buddhism, please look through our [Web Resources](https://www.pbs.org/edens/thailand/buddhism.htmwebresources.htm) section for other in-depth, online sources of information.

 ** Siddhartha Gautama: The Buddha**!

Historians estimate that the founder of Buddhism, Siddhartha Gautama, lived from 566(?) to 480(?) B.C. The son of an Indian warrior-king, Gautama led an extravagant life through early adulthood, reveling in the privileges of his social caste. But when he bored of the indulgences of royal life, Gautama wandered into the world in [[SEARCH]] of understanding. After encountering an old man, an ill man, a corpse and an ascetic, Gautama was convinced that [[suffering]] lay at the end of all existence. He renounced his princely title and became a monk, depriving himself of worldly possessions in the hope of comprehending the truth of the world around him. The culmination of his [[SEARCH]] came while meditating beneath a tree, where he finally understood how to be free from [[suffering]], and ultimately, to achieve salvation. Following this epiphany, Gautama was known as the Buddha, meaning the "Enlightened One." The Buddha spent the remainder of his life journeying about India, teaching others what he had come to understand.

 **The Four Noble Truths**

 The Four Noble Truths comprise the essence of Buddha's teachings, though they leave much left unexplained. ==They are the truth of [[suffering]], the truth of the cause of [[suffering]], the truth of the end of [[suffering]], and the truth of the path that leads to the end of [[suffering]]. More simply put, [[suffering]] exists; it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end.== The notion of [[suffering]] is not intended to convey a negative world view, but rather, a pragmatic perspective that deals with the world as it is, and attempts to rectify it. The concept of pleasure is not denied, but acknowledged as fleeting. Pursuit of pleasure can only continue what is ultimately an unquenchable thirst. The same logic belies an understanding of [[happiness]]. In the end, only aging, sickness, and death are certain and unavoidable.

The Four Noble Truths are a contingency plan for dealing with the [[suffering]] humanity faces -- [[suffering]] of a physical kind, or of a mental nature. The First Truth identifies the presence of [[suffering]]. The Second Truth, on the other hand, seeks to determine the cause of [[suffering]]. In Buddhism, [[desire]] and [[ignorance]] lie at the root of [[suffering]]. By [[desire]], Buddhists refer to craving pleasure, material goods, and immortality, all of which are wants that can never be satisfied. As a result, desiring them can only bring [[suffering]]. [[ignorance]], in comparison, relates to not seeing the world as it actually is. Without the capacity for mental concentration and insight, Buddhism explains, one's mind is left undeveloped, unable to grasp the true nature of things. Vices, such as greed, [[envy]], hatred and anger, derive from this [[ignorance]].

The Third Noble Truth, the truth of the end of [[suffering]], has [[dual]] meaning, suggesting either the end of [[suffering]] in this life, on earth, or in the spiritual life, through achieving Nirvana. When one has achieved Nirvana, which is a transcendent state free from [[suffering]] and our worldly cycle of birth and rebirth, spiritual [[enlightenment]] has been reached. The Fourth Noble truth charts the method for attaining the end of [[suffering]], known to Buddhists as the Noble Eightfold Path. The steps of the Noble Eightfold Path are Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Moreover, there are three themes into which the Path is divided: good moral conduct (Understanding, Thought, Speech); [[meditation]] and mental development (Action, Livelihood, Effort), and wisdom or insight (Mindfulness and Concentration).


 Contrary to what is accepted in contemporary society, the Buddhist interpretation of [[karma]] does not refer to preordained fate. [[Karma]] refers to good or bad actions a person takes during her lifetime. Good actions, which involve either the absence of bad actions, or actual positive acts, such as generosity, righteousness, and [[meditation]], bring about [[happiness]] in the long run. Bad actions, such as lying, stealing or killing, bring about unhappiness in the long run. The weight that actions carry is determined by five conditions: frequent, repetitive action; determined, intentional action; action performed without regret; action against extraordinary persons; and action toward those who have helped one in the past. Finally, there is also neutral [[karma]], which derives from acts such as breathing, eating or sleeping. Neutral [[karma]] has no benefits or costs.

 ** The Cycle of Rebirth**

[[Karma]] plays out in the Buddhism cycle of rebirth. There are six separate planes into which any living being can be reborn -- three fortunate realms, and three unfortunate realms. Those with favorable, positive [[karma]] are reborn into one of the fortunate realms: the realm of demigods, the realm of gods, and the realm of men. While the demigods and gods enjoy gratification unknown to men, they also suffer unceasing jealousy and [[envy]]. The realm of man is considered the highest realm of rebirth. Humanity lacks some of the extravagances of the demigods and gods, but is also free from their relentless conflict. Similarly, while inhabitants of the three unfortunate realms -- of animals, ghosts and hell -- suffer untold [[suffering]], the [[suffering]] of the realm of man is far less.

The realm of man also offers one other aspect lacking in the other five planes, an opportunity to achieve [[enlightenment]], or Nirvana. Given the sheer number of living things, to be born human is to Buddhists a precious chance at spiritual bliss, a rarity that one should not forsake.
