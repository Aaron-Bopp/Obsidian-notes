## Highlights

> literature pits identity blindness (e.g., color blindness) against identity [[conscious|consciousness]] (e.g., multiculturalism),


> Color blindness has ego-protective features



> the literature suggests that, with some exceptions, color blindness has negative implications for interracial interactions, minorities’ perceptions and outcomes, and the pursuit of diversity and inclusion in organizational contexts



> The research reviewed coalesces to suggest that while multiculturalism generally has more positive implications for people of color, both models have the potential to further inequality.




> groups associated with perpetrating [[racism]] (e.g., Whites) maintain an egalitarian [[self-image]], because it allows them to believe they are nonprejudiced and are [[self]]-presenting as such



> Whites’ use of color blindness in interracial interaction correlates with external motivation to control prejudice



> When threat-ened, White [[America|Americans]] high in social dominance orienta-tion (i.e., preference for group-based hierarchy) use color blindness to defend the status quo



> Color blind-ness removes the plausibility of [[racism]] and, therefore, the opportunity for addressing it.



> Children in the color-blind condition perceived [[racism]] less and recalled events in ways less likely to alert teachers to rac-ism occurring



> Whites tended to avoid mentioning race when playing with a Black partner, but ironically, the strategy prompted a perception of them as more biased



> color-blindness-abiding Whites showed more cognitive impairment and less ability to inhibit negative nonverbal behaviors.



> If there is evidence of the institution’s commitment to diversity, however, a mes-sage that stresses equal opportunity may be more moti-vating to people of color than one that focuses only on tolerance and diversity efforts, especially when their representation is low


## New highlights added August 24, 2021 at 9:20 PM
- > "Why is it dif-ficult for some people to embrace multiculturalism? One key factor is threat." 
- > "Another possible reason relates to belonging. Diversity tends to be associated with non-White groups (Unzueta & Binning, 2010), and Whites can feel excluded by multiculturalism (Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011)." 
- > "Some research suggests that support for multicultural ideology relates to less stereotyping (Hachfeld et al., 2015; Velasco González et al., 2008), whereas other research points to greater stereotyping (Wolsko, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000). However, in the latter case, stereotyping does not necessarily link to lower regard for ethnic minorities among Whites or ability to use indi-viduating information. With regard to prejudice, Whites and people of color who endorse multiculturalism show lower prejudice (Ryan et al., 2007; Wolsko et al., 2006)" 
    - It seems multiculturalism has complex effects on society
- > "Exposure to a multicultural passage temporarily reduces implicit prejudice (Lai et al., 2014) and results in less implicit and explicit prejudice than color blindness" 
- > "Multiculturalism can also have positive implications for interracial interaction, engagement, performance, and detection of discrimination" 
- > "exposure to a multicultural university statement (stressing strength in and embracing diversity) yielded better performance for [[women]] of color than a color-blind statement (stressing similarity and that social iden-tities are immaterial; Wilton et al., 2015)." 
- > "Whites exposed to multiculturalism displayed more hos-tility in an interracial interaction after being threatened" 
- > "Highlighting an organization’s diversity initiatives can also undermine detection of discrimination. Their pres-ence can create a deceptive impression of organiza-tional [[fairness]], such that high-status group members are less likely to identify discriminatory behavior against low-status group members (Kaiser et al., 2013)." 
- > "Color blindness, while often heralded as a remedy for [[racism]], can foster negative outcomes for people of color (e.g., interper-sonal discrimination). Moreover, color blindness serves to reify the social order, as it allows Whites to see them-selves as nonprejudiced, can be used to defend current racial hierarchies, and diminishes sensitivity to [[racism]]." 
- > "Multiculturalism can provoke threat and prejudice in Whites, but multicultural practices can positively affect outcomes and participation of people of color in differ-ent institutional arenas. Yet it also has the potential to caricature and demotivate them and mask discrimina-tion."
