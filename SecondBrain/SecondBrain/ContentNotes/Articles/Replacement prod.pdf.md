## Highlights

> literature pits identity blindness (e.g., color blindness) against identity consciousness (e.g., multiculturalism),



> Color blindness has ego-protective features



> the literature suggests that, with some exceptions, color blindness has negative implications for interracial interactions, minorities’ perceptions and outcomes, and the pursuit of diversity and inclusion in organizational contexts



> The research reviewed coalesces to suggest that while multiculturalism generally has more positive implications for people of color, both models have the potential to further inequality.




> groups associated with perpetrating racism (e.g., Whites) maintain an egalitarian self-image, because it allows them to believe they are nonprejudiced and are self-presenting as such



> Whites’ use of color blindness in interracial interaction correlates with exter-nal motivation to control prejudice



> When threat-ened, White Americans high in social dominance orienta-tion (i.e., preference for group-based hierarchy) use color blindness to defend the status quo



> Color blind-ness removes the plausibility of racism and, therefore, the opportunity for addressing it.



> Children in the color-blind condition perceived racism less and recalled events in ways less likely to alert teachers to rac-ism occurring



> Whites tended to avoid mentioning race when playing with a Black partner, but ironically, the strategy prompted a perception of them as more biased



> color-blindness-abiding Whites showed more cognitive impairment and less ability to inhibit negative nonverbal behaviors.



> If there is evidence of the institution’s commitment to diversity, however, a mes-sage that stresses equal opportunity may be more moti-vating to people of color than one that focuses only on tolerance and diversity efforts, especially when their representation is low
