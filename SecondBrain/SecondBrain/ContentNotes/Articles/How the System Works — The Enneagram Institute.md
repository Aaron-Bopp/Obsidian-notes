## Highlights

> most people have a dominant wing. In the vast majority of people, while the so-called second wing always remains operative to some degree, the dominant wing is far more important.


> many people in the latter half of their lives have reported the development of their so-called “second wing.” And in individuals who have been pursuing psychological and/or spiritual work, we have seen evidence that this is true. We do not know, however, whether these students were merely seeing all of the positive potentials of the nine types unfolding in them as they matured—their second wing being one of the other seven types—or whether this was a specific development of the second wing type

### The Continuum of the Levels of Development
> without the Levels, the Enneagram is reduced to a “horizontal” set of nine discrete categories. By including the Levels, however, a “vertical” dimension is added that not only reflects the complexity of human nature [[Personality types are 3d and interconnected, not 2d and static]]
> with the Levels, a dynamic element is introduced that reflects the changing nature of the personality patterns themselves. You have probably noticed that people change constantly—sometimes they are clearer, more free, grounded, and emotionally available, while at other times they are more anxious, resistant, reactive, emotionally volatile and less free 

- The levels of development are within your primary type. Once you have surpassed level 1 you delve into other types [[enlightenment]]
> one must assess whether a person is in their healthy, average, or unhealthy range of functioning


> fully identified with the [[subconscious|ego]] and does not see himself as anything more than that: the ego must therefore be increasingly defended and inflated for the person to feel safe and to keep their identity intact [[Being in a defensive condition can cause you to be consumed by your ego]]
- ego can consume

> The more we move down the Levels, the more identified we are with our ego and its increasingly negative and restrictive patterns. Our personality becomes more defensive, reactive, and automatic— and we consequently have less and less real freedom and less real consciousness.

> As we become more present, we become less fixated in the defensive structures of our personality and are more attuned and open to ourselves and our environment. We see our personality objectively in action rather than “falling asleep” to our automatic personality patterns.

> As we become more present, we see our personality traits more objectively and the Levels become a continuous guide to self-observation,

> Ultimately, the goal is for each of us to “move around” the Enneagram, integrating what each type symbolizes and acquiring the healthy potentials of *all the types*


> he personality type we begin life with is therefore less important ultimately than how well (or badly) we use our type as the beginning point for our self-development and self-realization.


> We each have a *self-preservation* instinct (for preserving the body and its life and functioning), a *sexual instinct* (for extending ourselves in the environment and through the generations), and a *social instinct* (for getting along with others and forming secure social bonds).


> We call this instinct our *dominant* instinct. This tends to be our first priority—the area of life we attend to first. But when we are more caught up in the defenses of our personality—further down the Levels of Development— our personality most *interferes* with our dominant instinct.


> Moreover, those primarily focused on self-preservation, by extension, are usually interested in maintaining these resources for others as well


> They might have active social lives and a satisfying intimate relationship, but if they feel that their self-preservation needs are not being met, still tend not to be happy or at ease. In their primary relationships, these people are “nesters”—they seek domestic tranquility and security with a stable, reliable partner


> There are many people that we are excited to be around for reasons of personal chemistry that we have no intention of “getting involved with.” Nonetheless, we might be aware that we feel stimulated in certain people’s company and less so in others.


> can become disenchanted with partners who are unable to meet their need for intense energetic union


> Moreover, Sexual types seek intimacy, Social types seek *personal connection*: they want to stay in long-term contact with people and to be involved in their world. Social types are the most concerned with doing things that will have some impact on their community, or even broader domains.


> hey seek partners with whom they can share social activities, wanting their intimates to get involved in projects and events with them. Paradoxically, they actually tend to avoid long periods of exclusive intimacy and quiet solitude, seeing both as potentially limiting


> Social types lose their sense of identity and meaning when they are not involved with others in activities that transcend their individual interests.
