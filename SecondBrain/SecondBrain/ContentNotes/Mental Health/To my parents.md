###### [[To my parents]]

To [[my parents]], //My [[trauma]] manifesto
I loved you. I always loved you, from the day I saw your faces. I don't remember it, most kids don't, but I know I loved you. I don't [[love]] you anymore. I know it hurts to read, and I wish it hurt more to say. Turn away if you want. I can't hold back any longer. I can't coddle your feelings. You hurt me. Whether you like to admit it or not, whether you remember doing it or not, whether you believe you didn't or not. The purpose of my entire life has been to please you. I was never [[Christianity|christian]]. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never a good student. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never happy. I pleased [[my parents]]. 

Is this hyperbole? yes. Is it how I really feel? yes. You guys got lucky. You got a really smart kid. All your kids are smart, but ==only one had two examples of what not to do.== [[To my parents#^8e0501]] What not to do if you want to avoid that disapproving tone that strikes fear into our hearts to this day. You didn't have to beat me, ==I wish you did==. [[To my parents#^ea7957]] I wish I could have realized earlier that there was no purpose in pleasing you. But how could I have known. How could I have known that ==who I was== [^3] would forever bar me from your [[love]]. I should have known that something about me that I couldn't change would be the reason that I would fail, because I changed everything else. Why do I have [[anxiety]]? because I see everything. Why do I hate myself for being [[Queer|gay]]? because I see everything. Why do I feel like the only thing that can make my life worth living is SAVING EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD? because I see everything. ==Every disapproving stare==, [[To my parents#^14d024]]==every haughty laugh==, [^5] every pained face, every face with dried tears, every look of disdain, EVERY THING. I saw it all and I took it to heart. Everything was categorized: approved or not approved. If it was approved I strived for it. I made it part of my [[self]] worth. Why is every single part of my personality because of you? If it was disapproved of I shunned it. I buried it so deep inside of me that even I couldn't find it anymore. Thank god I'm smart enough not to send this. 

- I viewed myself as the best version of the brother a sister, even said it out loud for years ^8e0501
- I feel like it would be easier to admit and understand [[trauma]] that comes from a more common source ^ea7957
- being [[Queer|bisexual]]
- common from both [[parents]] ^14d024
- more common from mom than dad 

Eventually I buried so many things I thought I couldn't be saved. I started to get confused about what was a lie and what was me. How could I ever know if I was saved? I didn't know what I really thought, I didn't know if I was genuine or not because EVERYTHING I DID WAS TO PLEASE YOU. when I realized I couldn't do it anymore I gave up. I gave up trying, but I didn't give up hoping. I kept up appearances, because maybe I could do it. Maybe I could be the golden child. I failed. Eventually the facade started to slip. I started to realise I was happier when it did. I wanted to be honest with you but I was scared. Scared of the things that I had built my life to avoid. I learned how to manipulate so well I don't even know when I'm not. I don't know if I'll ever know if I'm genuine.

I don't know if I'll be able to work through this with you. For me this is freeing, but I don't know what itll be. I hope that deep down you've realized that maybe you made a mistake.

Why do I never reach out for help. I had to reach the point of emotional breakdown, on top of years of effort, just to give my Aunt a call. Why am I trained to keep it inside. I've always kept it inside. I could barely speak when I called her. I sounded like a driveling idiot. In your house that would have been an offence I wouldn't have allowed. I wouldn't have let that out. You wired my brain to be that way. You broke my brain. It's no surprise it took me so long to realize I had [[ADHD]]. In evolutionary theory, people with [[ADHD]] would have been the hunters. People whose brains were fast enough that they could be aware of every threat. Be aware of every opportunity of success. I was on the hunt, but really I was being hunted. I had so much going on that I needed that extra brain power. It wasn't until I was alone in my room with nothing to be afraid of that it was too much.

21 years its taken me to figure myself out.

[[Empathy]] first. I had [[empathy]] for you when Grandma died. It’s seared into my memory. I can remember it plain as day. It wasn't traumatic, but I think it changed me. I saw you grieving, I felt your pain. How I don't know but the brain is powerful and children's brains especially. Maybe I decided that I never wanted you to hurt that way because of me. Maybe I didn't understand it that well. I don't know

My childhood is a blur, I have memories but very few are strong. There's too many things to remember I suppose.

I can't believe [[my parents]]. My trust for them is broken. Too many lines crossed, too many problems disregarded. If you really loved me, it would be easy. There'd be nothing that could stand between you loving your child. No peace of [[theology]], no few verses in the bible, no single word in a single verse that was mistranslated in 1946. I know you think you [[love]] me. But you have to [[love]] all of me. and you have to like it. I can't compromise. I have my entire life.

I wish I could go back and not be [[Queer|bisexual]]. (this spawned a whole tangential brain tangent that I didn't write down) if that happened I wouldn't be writing this. I would be confused still. I probably would never address my [[trauma]]. Because being [[Queer|gay]] wasn't the reason I never felt loved. You didn't know, how could you, I hid it so well. I would still have [[anxiety]], I would still be depressed, I would still feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. I would have still have based every part of my life off of pleasing you. I just would have never realized it. Something about christianitys obsession with gayness never sat right with me. It was the start of it all, my walk away from the church, from my [[faith]], and finally from you. It is so incredibly illogical. It has no reason except embed hatred in the very nature of [[christianity]]. It’s not a sin. It was never a sin. But it took the realm of sin away from action and into lifestyle.  How could you not hate people that LIVED A LIFE OF SIN. And once you hate one group of people for something they can't change it becomes a whole lot easier to hate other groups for the reasons they can't change. Who cares about poor people, it's their choice. Who cares about black people, it's their choice. Who cares about [[Queer|gay]] people, it’s their choice.

I can't bottle this up. I will be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I have been dealing with it for my entire life. I just understand it better now.

I don't know if I'm right. Maybe I'm delusional. But I have to understand why I feel the way that I feel. it has to come from something. there is an explanation. maybe i've found it, but i don't know if i'll ever convince myself I have. I will live it. I will work through it. but it will never leave me.
