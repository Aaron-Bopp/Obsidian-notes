The way you represent a todo note will vary system to system and person to person. The most important thing is that you are able to find the things you need todo quickly and easily. This can mean having a permanent note where you are your todos whenever you think of them, or a feature like a tag or unique symbol that will allow you to find them easily in other notes. You can also create more narrow representations of todo's if the way you will interact is significantly different. Once you have completed a todo, it should be removed from your todo list.
