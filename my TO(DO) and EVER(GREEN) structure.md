This structure is how I [[make your inbox into an entry point]] and is deeply entwined with [[how I use Obsidian tags]] as a part of [[My Second Brain]]

- TO tags should be used for specific items, not general tasks	
- TO tags are note a daily todo, they are a way to specify a task inline the to be done in the future. These tags should be temporary, but they are not scheduled		
- #TO  see all the things you want to do in you [[second brain]]
	- [[TO/DO]] things that you have to actively take part in,
		- [[TO/DO/WRITE]] write a specific item, not used for need to write or expand an evergreen note
		- [[TO/DO/PROGRAM]] 
		- [[TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE]] 
	- [[TO/EXPLORE]] 
		- [[TO/EXPLORE/READ]] 		
		- [[TO/EXPLORE/WATCH]]
		- [[TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH]] 
	- [[TO/PONDER]] ideas or concepts that require deep thought.
		- [[TO/PONDER/ME]] 
		- [[TO/PONDER/SOCIETY]]

- This structure is both a reference for what kind of note it is, but also an entry point to work on [[evergreen note]]s
- #EVER see all the evergreen notes in the [[second brain]]
	- [[EVER/SEED]] concept that exists in the [[second brain]] but is not guaranteed to grow
		- [[EVER/SEED/UNPLANTED]] a concept that hasn't been contextualized into the [[second brain]] little more than the tile of a potential [[evergreen note]] Highest priority because with the context the concept may not make sense in the future
		- [[EVER/SEED/WATER]] a concept that needs to be fleshed out and written
	- [[EVER/SPROUT]] concept that has body an promise, but I have no current intention of expanding
		- [[EVER/SPROUT/WATER]] concept needs more time and energy put in
		- [[EVER/SPROUT/CULTIVATE]] concept needs to be cleaned up and interconnected with the rest of the [[second brain]]
	- [[EVER/GREEN]] concept that holds weight, value, and knowledge in the [[second brain]] and needs no immediate work
		- [[EVER/GREEN/PRUNE]] [[evergreen note]] that needs to be looked at and rethought through in the context of the [[second brain]]. May include adding and removing connections, separating out distinct concepts into their own notes and removing inaccurate information
