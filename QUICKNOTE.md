[[topics/on me.md]]: I have a stored up emotion of hating myself
	- When this emotion comes up, the mind rationalizes it away, but the emotion is just stored away ([[Samskara]]: ball of emotion)

[[2021-05-31]] 04:35
[[topics/on me.md]]: I don't know if I'm introspective, maybe I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] instead of dealing them

[[2021-05-31]] 04:35
[[topics/on me.md]]: I've always prided myself on being introspective, but as I watch and Dr. K's sessions and relate to something or see how something may have affected me it triggers my fight or fligh t. I'm starting to think that I'm not introspective, I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] away instead of dealing with them.

[[2021-05-31]] 04:35
[[topics/on me.md]]: I have a similar feeling where even when I'm happy and enjoying myself it feels pointless, because I know that sadness will come again anyways. I think maybe that's why you feel deflated/discouraged. You recognize that your productivity is the outlier not the rule, and you're not confident that it means anything. The fear of never stopping working seems like another thing, but idk what. I don't think either are weird or irrational thoughts though.

[[topics/on me.md]]: The thought of idk how much pain im feeling/idk why im crying comes from my [[parents]] always discounting my crying by saying i have a fast cry trigger but I think that made me think that [[my emotions]] weren't natural and so I hid them and shut them off

[[2021-05-31]] 04:35
[[topics/on me.md]]: #TO/PONDER/ME Because I had so much trouble controlling [[my emotions]] as a child, I still view emotionality as weakness and there might be some misogyny there????

[[2021-05-31]] 04:35
[[topics/on me.md]]: I isolate myself when I am sad or depressed because I am used to my emotions being invalidated. Did I say I don't know why I'm crying so often because if I said how I felt my emotions were invalidated or just because I actually didn't know? Why I am constantly searching for validation? What the fuck is even being validated? I never got an answer for why I was crying, so I just stopped crying. 

[[2021-05-31]] 04:34
[[topics/on me.md]]: I'm never vulnerable, everything is always calculated.

[[2021-05-31]] 04:33 PM - I never allow myself to be vulnerable, I only do it when I forced to be.
[[2021-05-31]] 04:33 [[topics/on me.md]]: do I wanna be the girl or do I just want the [[emotional validation]] that girls get?

[[2021-05-31]] 04:32 [[topics/on me.md]]: is it okay to want [[emotional validation]]? Do I want validation from people I know or people I don't know?

[[2021-05-31]] 04:26 [[topics/emotional validation.md]]:  #TO/PONDER/ME   Emotional validation has been on my mind a lot recently. It feels like a lot of my worse behaviors are built around emotional validation. I cut myself off and refuse to reach out for help because I afraid that my emotions won't be validated. Of course this is a never ending circle. 

[[2021-05-31]] 04:21 [[topics/gender.md]]:  #FunFact Cave art (drawn between 10k-35k years ago) was done by men and women of all ages but it was dominated by teenage males [#Ref](https://www.livescience.com/7028-ancient-cave-art-full-teenage-graffiti.html) 

[[2021-05-31]] 04:13 [[my emotions]]: #TO/PONDER/ME Do I get tired of human interactions over time because I am an introvert or is the there a deeper meaning?
