When entering into social situations you might feel anxiety because you don't if you are going to have any friends there, or what exactly the plans are, or how you will interact with the people there. The cause of this [[anxiety]] seems to be [[fear of consequences]] but in actuality you only fear those consequences because they will make you feel worthless. 

 Our brain builds itself around things that will increase our fitness ([[Neuroscience]]) and one of those this is [[social fitness]]. If you are able to interact and win favor among other humans you are more likely to pass on your genes which thus increases your [[social fitness]]. The way that this primal urge manifests in our complex understanding of emotion is in [[self-worth]] and by contradiction [[insecurity]] of [[self]].  
 
 If you have a strong sense of [[self-worth]] it means that you have  achieved a level of [[social fitness]] that is satisfactory to you. If you are not secure in your [[self]] you will be more primally afraid of the consequences of negative [[social interaction]].
