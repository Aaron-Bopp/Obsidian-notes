I'm so confused. My brain just feels in a fog. I feel like the fog is emotion. I feel the fog is emotion I don't understand? Or maybe the fog isn't emotion, maybe the fog is my brain trying to find it's way through emotion. I can't think straight. I can't discover the source of this feeling. Why am I happy? Why do I feel like I could talk to people now? What is it about the last five days that has allowed me to feel this way and how do I replicate it? It feels good I think. I feels like I'm making progress, or is this just what my body needs. Is it the isolation and rest that is making me feel again, or is it the exploration of my gender? Or is it the reflection on my past when I was happy. Or is it the validation of my friends saying they love me. 


What is my path to happiness? 


Is what I'm feeling everybody else regular state or is it their hightened state? Because if its their hightened state, that would mean my normal state is normal, and that my feelings of brokeness are made up.

The genuine want to create and reach out to people feels unnatural because it is out of the norm, but it also feels like comfortable: it feels like it should be normal. 

I can't be normal. It shouldnt fell this odd to FEEL. Feeling should be the natural state, not not feeling. Or at least that's what I want it to be.
