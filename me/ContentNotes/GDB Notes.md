# [Intro](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/)

- #Def To be transgender is to have a gender identity which does not match the gender you were presumed to have based on the genitalia you were born with.
- A trans person can come to recognize this at _any point_ in their life
- Every trans person, regardless of their position within or outside of the gender binary, experiences some form of Gender Dysphoria.

# What is Gender?

> #Def Gender  
> The range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, femininity and masculinity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex, sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity (the personal sense of one's own gender).

- Human Sex (the adjective, not the verb) is broken down into three categories:
    - #Def Genotype: The genetically defined chromosomal kareotype of an organism (XX, XY, and all variants there of)
    - #Def Phenotype: The observable primary and secondary sexual characteristics (genitals, fat and muscle distribution, bone structure, etc)
        - Phenotype is also binary, but biology has recognized for hundreds of years that when you plot out all sexual characteristics across a population, you actually end up with a bimodal distribution
    - #Def Gender: The unobservable sexual characteristics, the internal mental model of a person’s own sex and the way that they express it.
- Gender is part social construct, part learned behaviors, and part biological processes which form very early in a person’s life.
    - It informs on a subconscious level
        - preference
        - behavior
        - perception
        - attraction
        - bonds
    - > #Def [habitus](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology)>) 
    - > Socially ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions. The way a person perceives and reacts to the world.
        - behaviors
        - communication
        - reactions
        - expectations
        - mannerisms

# Gender Dysphoria
- #Def Gender Dysphoria is a feeling of wrongness intrinsic to the self
	- it is simply emotional reactions to the brain knowing that something does not fit
- #Def Euphoria A feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness. Elation, joy, glee.
	- Gender Euphoria is the feeling relief from dysphoria
	- Euphoria is equal and opposite to dysphoria. If your feelings of dysphoria are not strong, your feelings of euphoria will not be strong
	- Euphoria is NOT is a sexual high, turn on, or fetish
- #Def Physical Dysphoria is discomfort over the shape of one’s body due to the sexual characteristics it presents.
	- Me Wrists and hands??
	- It’s okay for you to realize you need more or less than when you started.
	- It’s okay if you don’t hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.
	- It’s okay if you only hate some aspects of your body, and don’t wish to change all of its sexual characteristics.
	- It’s okay if you don’t need medical transition _at all_. Body feelings are not the be-all-end-all of transition.
- If you're under the assumption that you're a cis guy but have always dreamed of being a girl, and the only reason you haven't transitioned is because you're afraid you'll be an "ugly" girl: That's dysphoria. You're literally a trans girl already, hon.
- #Def Biochemical Dysphoria - brain desires estrogens or androgen but the body is producing the opposite which produces a sort of brain fog, a reduction in mental capacity, and a general state of [[anxiety]] and unease
	- #Def **[[Depersonalization]]** is a disconnect from your own body, an inability to believe that the person you see in the mirror is actually yourself
		- watching someone else in your body
		- don't care about your body because you have no ownership
		- Feeling as if you have an “unreal” or absent self: “I have no self”
		- Being absorbed in yourself and experiencing a compulsive self-scrutiny or extreme rumination
		- Having an ongoing and coherent dialog with yourself
