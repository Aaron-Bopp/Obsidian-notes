### [Healing from Festered Emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXGhT4pJcj8)

- There is the emotional mind, the intellectual mind and the [[ego]]
    - if you don't know who you are where does your sense of identity come from --> others
    - one function of [[ego]] is to compare
    - #Ref/DrK "[[ego]] is when the sense of self comes from the outside"
- #TO/PONDER/ME  Is my vacuum of self filled with my intelligence?
- #Def Alexithymia - someone who is colorblind to emotion
    - Men are socially developed to suppress emotions except for anger
        - anger is the only thing men understand
        - all other emotions are not developed
- #Ref/DrK "There is evidence that having an internally consistent way of viewing the world is a good way to find peace and happiness and to build resilience"
    - What is the way I am viewing my life and existence?
- Ways to find **_[[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]_**
    - Experiential route
        - ex find masculinity/what it means to be a man inside yourself
    - philosophical route
    - Dreams and nightmares
- Dual Nostril breathing [[meditation]] at [1:50](https://youtu.be/sXGhT4pJcj8?t=7801) ^92ae7b
    - When you meditate and drift off/lose focus what is the part of your mind that is pulling it back?
    - The ability to observe is divine. It is not good or evil, it is that which notices everything else
- Everytime you bring your mind back from wandering its a mental pushup
    - [[ADHD]] is your mind ==wandering without any purpose==
