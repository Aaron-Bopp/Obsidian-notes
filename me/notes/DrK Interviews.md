- There is the emotional mind, the intellectual mind and the [[ego]]
    - if you don't know who you are where does your sense of identity come from --> others
    - one function of [[ego]] is to compare
    - #DrK "[[ego]] is when the sense of self comes from the outside"
- #Explore Is my vacuum of self filled with my intelligence?
- Alexithymia - someone who is colorblind to emotion

- #DrK "There is evidence that having an internally consistent way of viewing the world is a good way to find peace and happiness and to build resilience"

### [Life after a cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldTMLhTMZAc)

- #DrK said "It's okay" and Zorian teared up
    - Similar to when a tiktoker accepted me and I bawled
- "I'm not allowed to make a mistake because a mistake means lost time and time is precious because I've already lost so much. The remainder of time is more valuable from this perspective"

    - #DrK doesn't accept this perspective despite how logically correct it is
        - "You can't make up for the past, it has already happened"
        - "You can't let your feelings to someone else. You can't tolerate letting other people know about the ugliest parts of your being"
        - #Explore "It's not a fear of rejection its a fear of acceptance" ^66ce4a
        - "Loathing yourself is the opposite of acceptance"
        - "Your intellectual [[ego]] will subside when it's no longer needed. It's not about getting rid of it it's about no longer needing it to protect you"

- "oh shit when he said he was being objective and Dr K explained that this was actually the most subjective thing he does i instantly recognized this within myself aswell. In an effort to be more objective I'm just distancing from my true self to create a second position from which I can observe myself without actually FEELING things and instead rationalizing & observing them." -yt comment

### [Destiny Interviews Dr. K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIHEtK3WktE)

- Dr.K's understanding of Kharma is that every effect has a cause going back to the beginning of the universe.
    - Reincarnation is just one aspect of this.
    - Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
    - Some of things in this life come from before the consciously observable life of an individual
- Dharma is the moral opposite of Kharma
- #Explore Evidence based alternative medicine
- #DrK Between your emotional and logical mind is the hum ghar or [[ego]] which activates to protect you from negative emotions and bullies your intellectual mind into coming up with justifications
- #Explore MDMA and Pcysolibin might be a telescope to new topics
