- Crafting a logline for Aaron Bopp
    - Aaron Bopp is a 21 year old... person. They look like a boy, they smell like a boy, but they don't think they're a boy. Nobody would ever know, their persona doesn't reveal such personal things. They like to pretend to be other people, and somehow those other people are more real than them sometimes. Aaron is stuck in a oblong, windowless room in Missouri without a means to leave. Aaron is stuck in a oblong, windowless brain in misery without any means of escape. Aaron spends to much time in his oblong, windowless room, but when he leaves he just gets stuck in his oblong, windowless brain. The work part of Aaron's oblong, windowless room is well designed, well used, and unkempt. The work part of Aaron's oblong, windowless brain is grease filled, over-worked, and tired. Their friends all like Aaron, but Aaron doesn't know how much he likes his friends. They like Patrick, but it might just be because Patrick's room is square, and full of fun knick-knacks, and easy to see into. Aaron's friends know he's confused, they know he's tired and sad, but just like him they don't understand what's happening in his oblong, windowless brain.
    - Aaron puts on skirts and ties up his hair while nobody watches, but they don't know what they see in the mirror. They want to try earings, and wigs, and packing and dresses, but they don't know what they want to be.
    - #Logline _Aaron Bopp_
        - Aaron Bopp is too angry at her parents, too insecure for her strengths, and too smart for her own good. She is tired of not knowing who she is despite knowing so much about everything else so they're pushing through the emotional barriers that they've setup to protect themselves, so she can find her true self and prevent a lifetime of meaninglessness.
- Fear: Why does it have to be there
