# Discovering My [[Gender]]

## Preparation

- It is completely normal to be unsure, scared, and confused about this process
- Self-care - Walking - Stretching - Meditation - Watch minecraft videos - organize/clean - eat - roleplaying games - problem solving
    > #Logline _Lord of the Rings_ Frodo Baggins is a young hobbit but his uncle left a mysterious ring when he ran off to live with the elves. Because of this ring Frodo and his friends would be flung into a dangerous trek to save the world from evil, and in the end themselves.
- Crafting a logline for Aaron Bopp
    - Aaron Bopp is a 21 year old... person. They look like a boy, they smell like a boy, but they don't think they're a boy. Nobody would ever know, their persona doesn't reveal such personal things. They like to pretend to be other people, and somehow those other people are more real than them sometimes. Aaron is stuck in a oblong, windowless room in Missouri without a means to leave. Aaron is stuck in a oblong, windowless brain in misery without any means of escape. Aaron spends to much time in his oblong, windowless room, but when he leaves he just gets stuck in his oblong, windowless brain. The work part of Aaron's oblong, windowless room is well designed, well used, and unkempt. The work part of Aaron's oblong, windowless brain is grease filled, over-worked, and tired. Their friends all like Aaron, but Aaron doesn't know how much he likes his friends. They like Patrick, but it might just be because Patrick's room is square, and full of fun knick-knacks, and easy to see into. Aaron's friends know he's confused, they know he's tired and sad, but just like him they don't understand what's happening in his oblong, windowless brain.
    - Aaron puts on skirts and ties up his hair while nobody watches, but they don't know what they see in the mirror. They want to try earings, and wigs, and packing and dresses, but they don't know what they want to be.

> #Logline _Aaron Bopp_ is too angry at her parents, too insecure for her strengths, and too smart for her own good. She is tired of not knowing who she is despite knowing so much about everything else so they're pushing through the emotional barriers that they've setup to protect themselves, so she can find her true self and prevent a lifetime of meaninglessness.

### Fear

> #Inspiration _The presence of fear means you are getting closer to discovering something about yourself._
> -- Dara Hoffman-Fox

#### Why does it have to be there

- Peering into the unconscious
    - Our unconscious/[[ego]] hides things that we fear and throws them away, but they're still their to make us scared.

#### How to deal with Fear

- Bodyguard: Hermione Granger - self explanatory
    - You [[ego]] overprotects you from your fears which leads to
        - being unable to experience life to the fullest
        - stunted growth
        - hiding truths from ourselves
- setting appointments with your fear
    - mantra/meditation
- When do fears come up?
    - when leaving the house
    - when people look at me
- #Logline Aaron is too angry at her parents, too insecure for her strengths, and too smart for her own good. She is tired of know so much about everything but herself. If she doesn't find herself, she will live a lifetime of sadness.
- What are your hopes for life after transition?
    - More emotionally connected to life
    - happier with friendships
    - more secure in who I am
    - hope for the future
    - have energy for life
- #BigThoughts When in crisis my nurturing was contingent on vocalizing the cause of pain not on comfort so instead of reaching out for comfort I reach out for understanding. This wasn't something somebody else could give so I bottled or dealt with fear alone. I dealt with crisis alone so often that I've taught myself that I have to be alone to heal. Idk
- What is my ideal situation of nurturing?
    - somebody who voluntarily comes and takes control of my decisions.
    - somebody who pushes hard to breakdown my walls and help me understand what's going on

> #Inspiration You have the right to choose self-actualization over continued repression
> -- Dara Hoffman-Fox

## Reflection

- Which of the following beliefs where you exposed to?
	- [ ] #Yes ==You interacted with other kids (at on the playground, siblings and cousins, etc.) and noticed how everyone tended to fall into certain roles, both in real life and during pretend-play.== 
	- [x] #No ==You were classified and socialized as a certain gender ("This is what girls do, this is what boys do—since you are a you need to follow these rules"). ==
	- [x] #No ==You were rewarded for behaving like your gender assigned at birth. ==
	- [x] #No ==You were scolded/punished for not behaving like your gender assigned at ==
	- [ ] #Yes ==The more you tried to express your true self, the more uncomfortable social situations became for you.== 
	- [x] #No ==No one else talked about feeling the same way as you—therefore you assumed you were the only person in the world who felt the way you did. ==
	- [x] #No ==You felt like you were acting the way you were to as your gender assigned at birth and you were doing it right.==
	- [ ] #Yes ==You learned that your society is divided up between boys and girls and that you were to fit into one of those categories.== 
	- [ ] #Yes ==You were exposed to TV, movies, media, and other means of communication that your society used to let you know how you were "supposed to"==
	- [x] #No ==You knowingly or unknowingly experimented with different gender roles when playing==
- Influences on gender identity in childhood
    - You felt a sense of shame, embarrassment, and guilt for expressing and experiencing yourself in certain ways. You felt like you had to either stop doing them or had to do them in secret.
    - You were raised in a community that was intolerant, fearful, and/or ignorant when it came to understanding differences between people. This could be due to living in a specific geographic region, growing up during a certain time period, lack of resources and information, less exposure (and therefore more resistance) to progressive changes and ideas, and/or certain cultural traditions (religious upbringing, military and other similar cultures, ethnic traditions). Therefore, you were being raised to believe that what you were experiencing within yourself was wrong or, at the very least, not knowing this was something anyone else in the world experienced. This could result in the repression of your authentic feelings because of pressure from the community and the desire to avoid its negative judgments.
    - You may have a difficult time recalling childhood memories due to experiencing stress and/or trauma during these years. You may have blocked out (i.e. repressed) these memories as a means of protecting yourself emotionally and mentally from the impact of what happened during this time frame.
    - You didn’t have a lot of exposure to anyone outside of your close family unit. This could be due to being homeschooled, parental careers that kept the family mobile, certain ethnic, cultural, or religious customs, isolation due to extreme stress in the home (alcoholism, severe mental illness, abuse), and so on. The impact of this depends on the type of upbringing you received from the primary adults in your life. It could result in the formation of a strong sense of self that is untouched by the ways of the world. It could also result in a sense of self that is based only on what the adults taught you as being the “truth.” Either way, until you were exposed to the bigger world, you may not have known there are any other ways of being that exist outside the one you were exposed to.
- Reflecting on your Childhood years
    - 3-5
        - I don't remember much these ages. I don't know if I had any conception of gender. I would go and play in the woods, catch minnows. I was very very modest. I would even let my mom see my genitals when she bathed me. I would cover them with a wash cloth. I was also very destructive. I would destroy my sister's toys (barbie limousine, house, not dolls) but I don't remember why. I would always cry when my parents left me at the nursery on Sundays. I would cry a lot
    - 6-9
        - I think this is when I developed empathy. I distinctly remember seeing my dad weeping when he got the news his mom died. I can remember being very sad cause I decided not to go to my sister's jazz recital. I think this is also when I started understanding people's reactions, most importantly my parents. I don't remember this as well, but I think at one point I said "Mom I think I wanna be a girl" or "Mom I think I'm a girl" and I remember the look of disdain or confusion she gave. The memory isn't clear but I think it's real.
    - 10-11
        - at this point I was very aware of my gender. I think I remember caring a lot of gendered toys and parties, not sure. The one distinct memory I have is one day being terrified because I my shorts didn't cover my knees, and I thought that boys shorts had to cover their knees. My brother would have been wearing but long cargo shorts around that time so maybe that contributes
    - 12-14
        - 2012 Facebook
            - very strong identity as geek/nerd

It's REALLY difficult to communicate without speech when trying to "discuss" a complex and misunderstood assignment. And the laughs? I'm so grateful for your sense of humor. What would happen to a sweet kid like you if YOU were one of the trafficked teens in America? I doubt those laughs and touches would be so reflexive. You're evidence for why we do fight against the plight of trafficked individuals. We want all children in the world to be free to love and laugh and respond to the people around them without fear.`
