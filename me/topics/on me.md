# On me

- I think in order for me to feel like my [[parents]] [[love]] me, I need to see them empathize with me --> which requires them too consider the fact that they might be wrong.
- I have a stored up emotion of hating myself
	- When this emotion comes up, the mind rationalizes it away, but the emotion is just stored away (samskara: ball of emotion)
- I don't know if I'm introspective, maybe I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] instead of dealing them
	- I've always prided myself on being introspective, but as I watch and Dr. K's sessions and relate to something or see how something may have affected me it triggers my fight or flight. I'm starting to think that I'm not introspective, I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] away instead of dealing with them.
- I have a similar feeling where even when I'm happy and enjoying myself it feels pointless, because I know that sadness will come again anyways. I think maybe that's why you feel deflated/discouraged. You recognize that your productivity is the outlier not the rule, and you're not confident that it means anything. The fear of never stopping working seems like another thing, but idk what. I don't think either are weird or irrational thoughts though. 
- The thought of idk how much pain im feeling/idk why im crying comes from my [[parents]] always discounting my crying by saying i have a fast cry trigger but I think that made me think that [[my emotions]] weren't natural and so I hid them and shut them off
- #BigThoughts Because I had so much trouble controlling [[my emotions]] as a child, I still view emotionality as weakness and there might be some misogyny there????
- #BigThoughts I isolate myself when I am sad or deppressed because I am used to my emotions being invalidated. Did I say I don't know why I'm crying so often because if I said how I felt my emotions were invalidated or just because I actually didn't know? Why I am constantly searching for validation? What the fuck is even being validated? I never got an answer for why I was crying, so I just stopped crying.
