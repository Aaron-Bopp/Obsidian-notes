Tags are an order of complexity lower than a topic or index note. A tag should be free of the context of any specific topic or area of knowledge. Tag's do not have the ability for specificity and connection that pages do, and thus if your tags are specific they will start to lose usefulness in the system. At that level of specificity you should just be using a [[topic note]] instead. 

However, general tags can get very large and thus [[Tags should be temporary]]
