When will I stop telling myself, "Just endure a little longer, Aaron. It'll be worth it in the end."

"Just endure a few more days, it'll be the weekend soon."
"Just endure a few more weeks, you'll see your sister soon." 
Just endure a few more months, your internship will be over soon."
"Just endure a few more years, your stocks will be vested soon." 
"Just endure a few more decades, your life will be over soon."

Just endure a few more days, it'll be the weekend soon.

Just endure a few more months, you'll get a better job soon.

Just endure a few more years, you can retire soon.

Just endure a few more decades, your life will be over soon.

The injustice of endurance
