I felt like my focus wasn't there today. I kept day dreaming about my future and other things while Nick was walking through the code. I was dreaming about my possible conversation with Ron Houston and what I would describe my career goal as. In those thoughts I was thinking about what kind of work would really fulfill me. I was thinking maybe being a consultant who comes in and has to absorb a lot of information fast and solve problems would be good for [[ADHD]] me but not for [[Adderall]] me. Like Adderall me really wants the overarching picture and to attack the problem from the outside in. What are ALL the inputs, how does EVERTHING work, before getting down to the smallest problem, but I feel like ADHD me would be better at absorbing needed information quickly and just solving the problem. Still not sure what my dream is, as I'm still questioning the role medication will play in my life. I'm not sure if I should even be on Adderall or if I'm taking too much. I might try on do a smaller dose tomorrow just to see what happens, but I think I will be sadder then. Not sure. I'm wondering if my problem is really a happiness thing and not a dopamine thing, or if the Adderall helps with the dopamine, but ADHD is not really the cause of it. ADHD makes sense, but I don't think it's a strong enough fit that other things couldn't be causing the problem. [[]]
